<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Master_Shake-Zula">Master Shake-Zula</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Voiced by <a href="" title="Dana Snyder">Dana Snyder</a>, Master Shake-Zula (or simply <a href="" title="Shake">Shake</a> and <a href="" title="Shake-Zula">Shake-Zula</a>) is a milkshake who has a pink straw and yellow hands. He is often greedy, lazy, and cruel to everyone around him. When the Aqua Teens solved crimes, Shake claimed to be the leader.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Frylock">Frylock</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Voiced by <a href="" title="Carey Means">Carey Means</a>, Frylock is a floating box of French fries who has laser lenses, dental braces, and a beard. He is easily the show&#39;s smartest and straightest character. He is somewhat of a father figure to Meatwad and often saves Shake and Meatwad from danger.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Meatwad">Meatwad</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Voiced by <a href="" title="Dave Willis">Dave Willis</a>, Meatwad is a large meatball with only one tooth. He is very childlike and naive. Frylock tries to be a good father figure to Meatwad, but Shake often tortures and pranks Meatwad, although in many episodes, Meatwad manipulates Shake into causing harm to himself and others. Often, Meatwad shows more intelligence than some of the characters, but for the most part remains childlike and immature.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Carl_Brutananadilewski">Carl Brutananadilewski</span></h3>
<p> </p>
<p>Voiced by Dave Willis, Carl Brutananadilewski is quick tempered, over weight, sarcastic, balding, mustachioed neighbor of the Aqua Teens. Carl loves everything about pornography, sports, his car, and sex. He hates it when the Aqua Teens are in his pool or when they (especially Shake) mess with his car. Nevertheless, possibly because he doesn&#39;t appear to have any friends of his own, he&#39;ll occasionally socialize with them to an extent - particularly when they share a common goal, such as barbecuing or playing trivia games at a sports bar.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dr._Weird">Dr. Weird</span></h3>

Dr. Weird did not appear on the show again until <a href="" title="Aqua Unit Patrol Squad 1 (season 8)">the eighth season</a>, but some episodes have a picture of him and Frylock in Frylock&#39;s room. The <a href="" title="Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters">movie</a> explains that it was Dr. Weird who created the Aqua Teens for the purpose of watching them crash into a brick wall, but this idea never became a reality. But in the end&#39;s twist, Dr. Weird was revealed to have been created by Frylock. Although, in 2010 during the &#34;Aqua Teen Hunger Force Live&#34;, series creator Dave Willis confirmed that Dr. Weird was indeed the creator of the Aqua Teens, making them brothers.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8NuvQbsgNA" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8NuvQbsgNA">Aqua Teen Hunger Force Q&#38;A at Aqua Teen Hunger Force Live in 2010</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Dr. Weird&#39;s voice was heard in the &#34;<a href="" title="Last Last One Forever and Ever">Last Last One Forever and Ever</a>&#34; episode, but he wasn&#39;t seen.

Although Dr.  Weird made his final appearance in &#34;Allen Part 1&#34;, Steve can still be seen as a cashier wearing a red shirt in the intro used in 2011.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ignignokt_.26lt.3Bsmall.26gt.3Band.26lt.3B.2Fsmall.26gt.3B_Err">Ignignokt &#60;small&#62;and&#60;/small&#62; Err</span></h3>
<p>Ignignokt, who is voiced by <a href="" title="Dave Willis">Dave Willis</a>, and Err, who is voiced by <a href="" title="Matt Maiellaro">Matt Maiellaro</a>, are two-dimensional aliens from Earth&#39;s <a href="" title="moon">moon</a>; they are both the most popular and well-known Mooninites.  Ignignokt is the taller, calmer, green leader and Err is the shorter, quick-tempered, pink sidekick.  They have eyebrows that almost never move.  They often rob stores, spray graffiti, corrupt Meatwad, and annoy the Aqua Teens and Carl, justifying their actions by claiming that their society is highly advanced and does not need rules or manners. While they do possess &#34;advanced&#34; laser weaponry, it is flawed due to the bullet being very slow-moving. In the episode &#34;Mayhem of the Mooninites&#34;, one of the bullets hit Carl in his  back and it transported him to the moon, while in &#34;Remooned&#34;, it generated sparks when it hit Carl.  The Mooninites can also lock in by attaching at the top of their heads (with Ignignokt on top), upon which they can combine their four laser blasts into the &#34;Quad Laser&#34;, although it is even slower.  In this form, they can also duplicate their faces to take the appearance of a giant gun (with the real Mooninites forming the handle) and fire an incredibly large and slow bullet called the &#34;Quad Glaser&#34;, though Err can only support the weight of their gun body for less than a minute before his legs break.  In their debut episode, &#34;Mayhem of the Mooninites&#34;, they also shown the ability to spin around while glowing and turn into the third dimension the appear invisible.  In &#34;The Last One&#34;, (which contains their only use of the Quad Glaser so far) they led the evil team &#34;Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday&#34; in an attempt to destroy the Aqua Teens. They are the main antagonists in six episodes of the show; however, in Spacecataz, they are one of the main protagonists. They also appear in the <i>Spacecataz</i> cold openings of <a href="" title="Aqua Teen Hunger Force (season 3)">season three</a> and make an appearance in the movie. While the two appear to be foul-mouthed and violent, it is heavily implied in the episode &#34;Moonajuana&#34; that they simply act out childishly for attention, stemming from traumatic childhoods. Light up devices displaying images of the characters caused the <a href="" title="2007 Boston bomb scare">2007 Boston bomb scare</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Oglethorpe_and_Emory">Oglethorpe and Emory</span></h3>
<p>Oglethorpe, who is voiced by <a href="" title="Andy Merrill">Andy Merrill</a>, and Emory, who is voiced by <a href="" title="Mike Schatz">Mike Schatz</a>, are two spiked aliens from <a href="" title="Pluto">Pluto</a>. Oglethorpe is the fat, orange, dumber, leader (who resembles a slice of cheese) and Emory is the green, smarter one (who resembles a shred of lettuce); however, their Master Shake &#34;clone&#34;, Major Shake, states the obvious fact that &#34;they&#39;re [both] really stupid.&#34;  Oglethorpe speaks with an <a href="" title="Austrian German">Austrian German</a> accent and Emory speaks like a stereotypical <a href="" title="Southern California">Southern California</a> American. Oglethorpe often comes up with crazy, mean-spirited schemes that do not make sense and Emory usually goes along with it. They are very advanced in teleportation and cloning technology. The episode &#34;The Last One&#34; shows that they are enemies of the Mooninites. They are the main antagonists in three episodes of the show; however, in Spacecataz, they are one of the main protagnists. They also appear in the <i>Spacecataz</i> cold openings of season four and they make brief appearances in the movie when they&#39;re with the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future come to Aqua Teens&#39; house to steal the missing piece of the Insanoflex. The characters may be named for two <a href="" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a>-area colleges: <a href="" title="Oglethorpe University">Oglethorpe University</a> and <a href="" title="Emory University">Emory University</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="MC_Pee_Pants">MC Pee Pants</span></h3>
<p>Voiced by <a href="" title="mc chris">mc chris</a>, MC Pee Pants is a mentally insane rapper who wears a shower cap and a diaper. His various schemes begin with the release of a <a href="" title="hip hop music">rap</a> CD, which is continuously played by Meatwad, who is often his biggest fan. His schemes are unusually complicated and completely nonsensical. Inevitably, Frylock gets involved at some point, and he typically engineers the wannabee rap star&#39;s demise and return to Hell and subsequent reincarnation into a different form. In all of his forms, he is recognizable due to his voice, shower cap, large yellow and red eyes, and diaper. He was the main antagonist in three episodes and he also makes a brief appearance in <i>The Last One</i> episode and the movie. He has been a spider (posing as a child rapper), cow, worm, old man (who later becomes a vampire), and housefly.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cybernetic_Ghost_of_Christmas_Past_from_the_Future">Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future</span></h3>
<p>Voiced by <a href="" title="Matt Maiellaro">Matt Maiellaro</a>, Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future, is a crazy robot that starts long stories with &#34;thousands of years ago...&#34; He thinks he knows everything about the past and future, but the movie revealed he just randomly strings words together to make up stories that never happened and never will. He was the main antagonist in one episode and makes a brief appearance in three others and the movie when he teams up with the Plutonians, he is shown to be attracted to Oglethorpe, much to their embarrassment. The episode called &#34;The Dressing&#34; has a character similar to the Cybernetic Ghost called Turkatron. He appears briefly at the end of the episode &#34;Larry Miller Hair System&#34;, speaking to an army of robots (who resemble the robots seen in the opening theme).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dr._Wongburger">Dr. Wongburger</span></h3>
<p>Voiced by <a href="" title="Tommy Blacha">Tommy Blacha</a>, Dr. Wongburger is an insane alien scientist. He appears in the episodes &#34;Dickesode&#34;, &#34;Creature from Plaque Lagoon&#34;, and &#34;Hands on a Hamburger&#34;. In his first appearance, he was a penis and the owner of Wong Burger, seeking out penises, including Carl&#39;s. At his restaurant, Wong Burger, Carl ripped off the bottom of his medium drink to reveal his prize when it only said &#34;tonight you will get your dick ripped off&#34;. Wongburger states that from this purchase that Carl has automatically signed a binding contract that enables them to rip off his dick. He was last seen in that episode being sued and he tried to escape in his dick spaceship but crashed into a building that was also made of dicks. In his next appearance, he was a tooth who took the form and the credit card of the Creature from Plaque Lagoon to get lots of teeth, and in his last appearance, he was a hamburger who was being touched by people who wanted to eat him (they did not know he was alive). Every time he appears on the show he attempts to return to the home planet of his species and Frylock calls him a madman. The second time he was called a madman he said &#34;I know that&#34;. His latest appearance was a non-speaking cameo role in &#34;One Hundred,&#34; where he appeared as his original penile form in Hannah-Barbara-like animation.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Freedom Cobra</b> - A living tattoo of a cobra, Shake got to pick up chicks. It was the tattoo artist cheapest tattoo and had to be &#34;<i>installed</i>&#34; during a lightning storm. It gives its wearer an appetite for human flesh. At first Shake managed to convince him to start off with Meatwad&#39;s dog Bobby (which was originally Shake&#39;s dog before it started attack him in response to his abuse), but later ending up eating Carl, after Freedom Cobra suggested they eat Meatwad (who Shake didn&#39;t want to eat out of fear of getting into trouble). Shake later told Frylock and Meatwad the truth after Frylock discovered Carl&#39;s hand. They took Shake to the doctor to get the tattoo surgically removed, but Freedom Cobra forced the doctor to cut off his hands so he and Shake could eat them. He also had the doctor give Shake plastic surgery apparently so no one can tell Shake&#39;s sad, after he&#39;s done eating them. It appears in the episode &#34;<i>Freedom Cobra</i>&#34;. In &#34;Lasagna&#34; it is revealed he is also Carl&#39;s doctor (or is simply a local doctor that both Carl &#38; the Aqua Teens go to). In the episode he reveals Carl that all his bones have fused into a single &#34;<i>superbone</i>&#34; and that his condition is the result of his consuming a &#34;<i>bone-restoring milkshake</i>&#34; (which Carl got from a guy he befriended in anger management, after he pushed Carl off the roof of Carl&#39;s  causing Carl to break every bone in his body) made by &#34;<i>ScamWow</i>&#34;. He tells Carl that the milkshake is not medicine but in his typical fashion Carl dismisses him (thinking he knows better). Despite telling Carl not drink the milkshake, the doctor is later seen drinking it (after Carl falls out the hospital window trying to get some of Master Shake&#39;s lasagna) and yells to Carl that his milkshake tastes great (and just like his reaction to his hands being cut off in &#34;<i>Freedom Cobra</i>&#34;, he is unfazed that his patients fall out the hospital&#39;s window (however it is possible that his reaction could be due to having possibly treated Carl in the past for his various injures he has received living next to the Aqua teens and these Carl&#39;s fall from the window would be nothing new).&#60;ref name=FreedomCobra&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</li></ul>
