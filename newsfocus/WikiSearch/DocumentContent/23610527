<p>There have been a number of user and talk pages recently created which are apparently tracking some sort of game, and using Wikipedia as a free web host. Sockpuppet case is here <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/ILMORGAME/Archive">Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/ILMORGAME/Archive</a>. And there&#39;s an example of this foolishness is at <a href="" title="User talk:ILMORSEASONTWO">User talk:ILMORSEASONTWO</a>. This user (or users?) clearly have zero interest in contributing to Wikipedia and are determined to take advantage of Wikipedia, and do not respond to attempts to discuss the situation, except with the occasional profanity. I suggest that this content and those creating it be <a href="" title="WP:BAN">banned</a>, and that any of these pages be deleted on sight without further attempts at discussion, as it has been made clear that they do not respond, but simply move on to a new name. <a href="" title="User:Beeblebrox">Beeblebrox</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Beeblebrox">talk</a>) 03:52, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>It gets old when some of us have been working on articles to see these kind of rapid fire copy and pastes that demonstrate neither knowledge of the topics under discussion or effort at researching the individual articles and considering what specifically is out there for the specific articles under consideration. Editors in discussions do not just repeat the same thing tirelessly as doing so is not a discussion. A discussion considers what the participants have looked for and what specifically they have found and how it might be used in each individual case. When I see four copy and pastes done in one minute&#39;s time, it is hard for anyone to see how that adds anything to the actual efforts to see what can be done with these articles over on the wikiproject page and yes, rapid fire copy and pastes across AfDs is rarely a sign of anything constructive, but as I do not like outright accusing, I included the question mark above.

I noticed a slew of rapid fire copy and pastes across multiple discussions, including even four of these in under a minute, which from past experiences with accounts that have done that at AfDs, naturally seems suspicious, and as such asked, not asserted, if others thought something of it here rather than just declare as much to the user.

<dd>I came here because I saw something that struck me as odd (applying the exact same comment to articles for award-winning performances as to ones that truly are not all that notable) and was hoping for good faith input if it is okay to just say the same thing in rapid-fire fashion without more carefully considering these differences.  My hope is that if it is a bit haphazard, a fair admin would politely advise the user to be more careful.  I am not asking for anything beyond that.  If I was, I wouldn&#39;t have a question mark in the section heading and would be far more declarative.  Ideally, the user would see that some of these can be sourced and join in our efforts to improve those we can so that we can work colloboratively together to improve our project.

<dd>You should do more than just &#34;scan&#34; them, but check for sources and discuss specific sources rather than simply copy and paste the same comment that does not necessarily apply uniformly to all half dozen plus articles, let alone providing no valid reason why at worst we would not at least redirect these <a href="" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> articles as deletion is an extreme last resort.

<dd>We know that you hate to see any article deleted. We get it. But get over it. It happens. Also, what Hesperian said. I certainly see no admin action needed here, and this should have been dealt with via a conversation with Moondyne. Framing a good faith vote as some sort of action against &#39;some of us who have been working on articles&#39; is repellent; there is no grand conspiracy to destroy work, and this sort of thing is precisely why a) the inclusionist/deletionist identification needs to stop, and b) why groups like the ARS should be turfed as promoting divisiveness. I suggest this be closed and you be stringently warned against using AN/I to further your extreme positions. →&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#355E3B;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>ROUX</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#355E3B;&#34;&#62;<b>₪</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;small&#62;&#38;nbsp;07:16, 14 July 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;

<dd>You are the one stirring up &#34;drama&#34; with this feigned outrage.  I asked a question; if someone thought his approach okay, then they could say as much and then that is that.  I didn&#39;t come here demanding action.  I saw something odd that didn&#39;t seem right and hoped a neutral and fair party would see what they thought and if they agreed it was just going down the Afds indiscriminately would caution against that, or if not a big deal, suggest as much and that&#39;s that.  Why you are reading beyond that is beyond me.  People should be able to not feel bullied out of asking questions when they see something that doesn&#39;t feel right and not everyone who posts here does so expecting or desiring some kind of needless uproar.  There is no reason why one fair minded admin could not have politely said either &#34;Yes, that does seem strange; let me ask him&#34; and then archive the thread or &#34;Well, not too big of a deal; just check with him instead&#34; and then so be it.

<dd>I have seen several accounts who actually do troll AfDs with rapid fire copy and paste deletes and are indeed now blocked for it, which is why I am suspicious when I see it again.  Yet, I do not want to assume that is the case.  And anyway, I am not an admin; I cannot make any final judgment myself.  Thus, I cannot imagine why it would be a bad idea to in good faith first ask for a neutral admin to see what he/she thought, i.e. for advice.  And in the interest of transparency, rather than email someone, just post it here.  There is absolutely no reason why on an admin board such as this it should have to descend into anything unpleasant.  I was not calling for sanctions and certainly not for any kind of public humiliation of the user, just for a neutral admin&#39;s thoughts, because I did not want to just post an accusatory message on the user&#39;s talk page if it wasn&#39;t warranted nor a more friendly request for clarification if my suspicions are more correct.  Where else, other than email, can we ask a random established admin what his or her thoughts are?

<dd>If in each AFD the same reasons for deletion apply &#34;Minor character, no real world significance,&#34; how is Wikipedia improved by making the Delete argument be phrased differently in each case?

<dd>My concern stemmed from the shear speed of the copy and pastes.  I usually spend several minutes on any Afd I comment in: 1) to read the discussion; 2) to read, not just scan, the article to see if I agree/disagree with the comments in the discussion; 3) to see if I can find any sources on Google News, Google Scholar, Google Books, Amazon.com, Academic Search Complete, and J-Stor; 4) if I do find sources, to add what I can, or if not at least make some grammar or stylistic fixes as evidence that I did review the article and so that if it is kept, then I at least did something to improve it.  One cannot do these things for four articles in one minute&#39;s time and a fifth article in the next minute.  And when I do argue to delete, I vary my arguments to fit the circumstances and discuss where I looked for sources and the results of my searches a la <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/A Warriors Trial">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/A Warriors Trial</a>, <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Baba Shanti Giri">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Baba Shanti Giri</a>, <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Carrie Petrelli">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Carrie Petrelli</a>, <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chihuahua heights">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Chihuahua heights</a>, <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Geometric Negative Value Theorem">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Geometric Negative Value Theorem</a>, <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/James Scott Hilk">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/James Scott Hilk</a>, etc.  Moreover, my concern was that while some of those did concern minor characters, others did have real world cited significance, such as for one performance that won and was again nominated for an award, i.e. the same copy and paste wording did not accurately apply across the board.  Doing more than just a scan of the articles would have revealed as much.

<dd>As I see it, The Fat Man Who Never Came Back made a disruptive comment in his edit summary. To be fair, you responded with a sarcastic comment on his talk page that didn&#39;t really address the conflict. If I had found a message on my talk page like that I wouldn&#39;t have known how to immediately respond to it, and neither would I have seen it as &#34;a polite attempt at communication&#34;. It&#39;s quite possible that I don&#39;t understand the seriousness of moving this text, or the immediate trouble that is sure to follow anyone who does so.

<li>Alternately, Durova, you can be satisfied in the knowledge that people agree that you are technically in the right, but then just let it go as not worth the drama. C&#39;mon people, this is not Utopia, we can allow things to get slightly messy and imperfect without threats of blocking and sanctions. Durova&#39;s response on his talk page was perfectly fine.  It&#39;s all a joke, it isn&#39;t hurting things <i>that</i> much, TFMWNCB pushed the joke a little too far when reverting a second time. But let&#39;s go find something else to do.

<p>If ever there were a page that needed some lulz, that would have been it. Nonetheless, Durova&#39;s edits were proper from the prescribed format point of view. Let&#39;s drop this now.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="User:Inurhead">User:Inurhead</span></h2>

<p>This user has been a minor problem for some time now, being a single-purpose account that exists apparently only to promote and maintain positive comments and puffy text regarding the film <i><a href="" title="The Hurt Locker">The Hurt Locker</a></i> and people connected to it. This has been going on since mid-2008, including a series of edits that add glowing comments, excessive details, selectively chosen review quotes, delete negative remarks, add non-standard formatting, and so on. Editors who challenge his edits are usually reverted, often with misleading edit summaries. I have had to constantly watchlist the article, and to also review all changes to it by this editor (including following up on reviews and references to ensure they are used correctly). Today, after dealing with the latest problematic changes, I noticed that Inurhead had begun to indiscriminately revert other edits I had done in articles unrelated to anything he had seen before, This included restoring spam links and incorrectly placed material. Anyway, long story short, I don&#39;t feel comfortable acting as an admin in this case because of the past history of having to clean up after this guy, so I&#39;d appreciate a third pair of eyes to review it. Thanks in advance. --<b><a href="" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i>&#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Ckatz">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;chat&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz">&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;spy&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/small&#62;</i> 03:15, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>Ckatz is a bad faith, <i><a href="" title="Bad Lieutenant">Bad Lieutenant</a></i> of Wikipedia. He trolls around certain limited sites and deletes and undoes the neutral hard work of other contributors. He should be thrown out of Wikpedia forever. Seriously. This guy is VERY, VERY bad news and so much so that other users have created third party thesaurus entries to describe exactly what a &#34;Ckatz&#34; is. Please, if anyone of authority at Wikipedia has an ounce of integrity, back track this user and see where he has chased certain contributors and maliciously deleted their material. Ask yourself, why has he chosen this one single movie to pick on? Why not TRANSFORMERS or BRUNO?

<dd>I think the fact that the guy chooses to use hate pages by <a href="" title="User:EverybodyHatesChris">banned users</a> as a way to justify his actions speaks volumes to the problem here. As far as I&#39;m concerned, Inurhead has had more than enough chances to try to cooperate within the parameters of what is expected. He&#39;s a single-purpose editor who is determined to promote a particular pet topic, and he is completely unwilling to tolerate input from others. Frankly, I could care less about the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Hurt_Locker&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302006476" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Hurt_Locker&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302006476">foul garbage he spews when his work is questioned</a>; his <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Inurhead&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302006211" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Inurhead&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302006211">most recent toxic blast on his talk page</a> is proof enough of where he is coming from.

<p>I&#39;ve focused on one small part of the changes noted above - the release date.  From what I could tell from looking at <a href="" title="WP:FilmRelease">WP:FilmRelease</a>, the correct release date for the film is 2008.  I&#39;ve opened a section on the <a href="" title="Talk:The Hurt Locker">talk page</a>, left a message on Inurhead&#39;s talk page <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Inurhead&#38;diff=302055667&#38;oldid=302041987" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Inurhead&#38;diff=302055667&#38;oldid=302041987"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Inurhead&#38;diff=302055667&#38;oldid=302041987" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Inurhead&#38;diff=302055667&#38;oldid=302041987">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Inurhead&#38;diff=302055667&#38;oldid=302041987</a></a> about the warring and pointing to the talk page.  Inurhead has deleted that message, plus others on this topic.  Yup, the year is a minor aspect, but if the user won&#39;t even attempt to discuss that, let alone anything else, on the talk page, it&#39;s not worth the time to go into the other topics raised above.  At least today (so far), the edit summaries from Inurhead has been polite, so I guess that&#39;s some sign of hope.  <a href="" title="User:Ravensfire2002">Ravensfire2002</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ravensfire2002">talk</a>) 18:53, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>At Kateshortforbob RfA, impersonator accounts JauarBeck and Tnxmen307 (now blocked) voted supported. Jauarback, another impersonator account, voted in Skomorokh Rfa. Today, Mikhailov Kusserow voted support in both RfAs. In his votes he included &#60;nowiki&#62;&#60;noinclude&#62;&#60;/nowiki&#62; tag, effectively hiding the support and neutral sections on the main RfA page. Mikhailov had previously been blocked for abusing sockpuppets on RfAs w/ a supposedly alternate account Michel Mapaliey (<a href="" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Mikhailov_Kusserow/Archive">see spi</a>), but was unblocked because he supposedly didn&#39;t know that it was against the rules. </p>
<p>This does not look reasonable to me. Both accounts had been registered for almost 2 years, and even if he really did not know, it&#39;s commonsense not to vote twice. Now combined w/ his recent actions, I see too much of a pattern to assume good faith. I believe administrator intervention is needed at this point. <b><i><a href="" title="User_talk:Rami R">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Rami&#60;/font&#62; &#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;R&#60;/font&#62;</a></i></b> 07:54, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>Since I&#39;m the one that blocked him, and given his general demeanor, I doubt that any attempt by myself to convince him to modify his behavior will succeed. A sanity check on the DUCK  test would be useful as well, as that influenced the block length.

<li><i>Only</i> if they are <i>from</i> an encyclopaedic content namespace <i>to</i> a non-encyclopaedic one, e.g. from the article namespace to the user namespace.  There&#39;s no blanket prohibition, and there are many cases of cross-namespace redirects between project and user spaces, both of which are not part of the encyclopaedia proper.  The better points to make are (a) if someone redirects xyr <i>user page</i> somewhere, it really has little to no effect on the encyclopaedia proper, or indeed on any other editor; and (b) it&#39;s a bit daft to protest that an article isn&#39;t as one wants it by making one&#39;s user page the same as the article that one doesn&#39;t like. <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 20:05, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>I&#39;m not sure I really buy that.  Redirecting a user page to a non-user page or non-user space page goes against the very reason for user pages, which is &#34;to facilitate communication among participants in [Wikipedia&#39;s] project to build an encyclopedia.&#34; Also, <a href="#DELETE" title="WP:R">WP:R</a> tells us that redirects must not cause confusion, must not be nonsensical, and must not cross name-spaces.  It&#39;s one thing to redirect a user page to a user talk page (although I can&#39;t see a particularly good reason to do so unless the user is banned), but there is no situation where I can see it being proper or useful to redirect a user page to a non-user page.  <a href="" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Exploding Boy">talk</a>) 23:19, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>Well you should because it&#39;s the case.  It&#39;s user <i>talk</i> pages that &#34;facilitate comunication&#34;.

<p> 
Hi, User:Dbachmann, an admin, has unilaterally removed the tags <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kosovo&#38;diff=300987247&#38;oldid=300950884" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kosovo&#38;diff=300987247&#38;oldid=300950884">here</a>, with the reason &#34;rm stale templates. There is the usual nationalist noise on talk, but this doesn&#39;t establish that there is any bona fide issue. If there is, use inline tags to help localize it.&#34;</p>
<p>The POV tag is dated December 2008. The Cite check tag is dated February 2009. I have been here for a couple of months, in that time no substantial edits have been made to merit the removal of the tags. I explained my position to the said admin <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dbachmann#Tag" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dbachmann#Tag">here</a> and was asked to inline tag all the non-neutral and dubious cites on the article - a move which would mean over half the article is tagged. This was explained to the admin in his talk page. The admin also accused me of improper conduct on Wikipedia, an notion I reject. The said user did not agree with my views and thus branded me a Wikipedian who gives the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kosovo&#38;diff=300987247&#38;oldid=300950884" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kosovo&#38;diff=300987247&#38;oldid=300950884">&#34;usual nationalist noise on talk&#34;</a>. I would agree that my actions have not always been proper, but my presence in the article is necessary to counter other points of view. The said user has assumed bad faith on other occasions, but I would like a response to this incident. </p>

<dd>The article beings; &#34;Kosovo is a disputed region in the Balkans.&#34; This, in its self is a POV statement as according to 62 nations (mostly English-speaking nations), it is a country located in the Balkans. Why shouldn&#39;t I be allowed to address these points without being called a &#34;nationalist&#34;. Why should we remove the tag when a Serbian POV has been allowed to override the article and thus un-due weight is given throughout. (<a href="" title="User:Interestedinfairness">Interestedinfairness</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Interestedinfairness">talk</a>) 00:20, 14 July 2009 (UTC)).
<dl>
<dd>No, it&#39;s an NPOV statement because it fairly describes the existing situation.  While Kosovars have unilaterally declared independence from Serbia and 62 nations have supported this, Serbia still claims Kosovo as a province and not even a plurality of the world&#39;s nations have given their support to its declaration of independence.  Until Serbia drops its claims and nearly all nations have accepted Kosovo as an independent nation, then it&#39;s quite fair, objective, and NPOV to say it is a &#34;disputed reason&#34;.  If you could provide reliable sources confirming that Serbia has accepted Kosovo&#39;s independence and given it such recognition, then your POV would become NPOV.  As it stands, there is no reason for administrator action in this case. <a href="" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 00:34, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps you guys could formulate some compromise wording that is acceptable to all - I doubt that we would use the phrase &#34;Israel is a disputed region in the Middle East.&#34; because a number of countries do not recognize Israel; or &#34;Iran is a disputed region in the Middle East.&#34; for similar reasons; or &#34;[North/South] Korea is a disputed region in Asia.&#34; or anywhere else. Perhaps using facts rather than the ambiguous weasel-word &#34;disputed&#34; such as Kosovo unilaterally declared independence from Serbia, 62 countries recognize such independence, and XX countries recognize Kosovo as a part of Serbia. or something else. I&#39;m not sure any admin action is required here? <a href="" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Carlossuarez46">talk</a>) 01:06, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Friends, my comment was with regards to the tags being removed, this discussion on here highlights the point I&#39;m trying to make -- that the Kosovo article still has outstanding issues which have not been resolved?
What do you mean this case has been &#34;resolved&#34; when none of the users commented on the topic I discussed (?)
The said administrator removed the tags without <b>any</b> consensus on <b>any</b> issues having been resolved since February or December respectively. (<a href="" title="User:Interestedinfairness">Interestedinfairness</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Interestedinfairness">talk</a>) 09:16, 14 July 2009 (UTC)).</p>
<p>The fact that this was marked &#34;approved&#34; without any proper discussion or relevance to my discussion on the tag removal is testimony to what I am pointing out. I have tried <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#Neuatrality_tags" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#Neuatrality_tags">here</a> and <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dbachmann#Tag" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Dbachmann#Tag">here</a> to have a constructive debate surrounding the issue and the said user has not justified his unilateral act once. He has merely weaseled his way around answering the qeustion. Ridiculous how much power administrators have. Will an administrator not involved in Balkan related articles please look into this properly -- <a href="" title="User:Interestedinfairness">Interestedinfairness</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Interestedinfairness">talk</a>) 09:04, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>That logic doesn&#39;t work (&#34;upload a picture? People can treat it as public domain and copy it&#34; doesn&#39;t make sense) and it would be a public policy nightmare for them to decide in such a way. Members of the judiciary also don&#39;t &#34;pass law&#34; as such (see the void principle) and would only be able to interpret existing statute, much of which is against us. <a href="" title="User:Ironholds">Ironholds</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ironholds">talk</a>) 19:06, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Websites that are in the business of selling photos will sometimes, or maybe often, have a built-in function so that if you hover over the photo a &#34;watermark&#34; will appear, and/or if you right click to try to download it, it won&#39;t let you. If that museum failed to protect their precious photos, they are on shaky ground complaining about people grabbing them. &#34;Here I am! Totally accessible! Don&#39;t download me, though!&#34; Right.

<dd>Yes, Bugs, but that doesn&#39;t mean that anyone can rip off images from other websites, bring it here, and fraudently post it as public domain, CC-BY-SA compatible, etc., because said website didn&#39;t take any actions to protect their images from being downloaded. <a href="" title="User talk:MuZemike">MuZemike</a> 07:18, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>I want to query whether any action is warranted to deal with the actions of User:Kiss-the-cop. I don&#39;t think I have come to the admin noticeboard previously, so please redirect me if this is the wrong place to raise this issue.</p>
<p>As can be seen <a href="" title="User talk:Kiss-the-cop">here</a>, the user now has had multiple speedy deletes, as well as a bot-generated warning about vandalism (the nature of which I can confirm), all in response to a very limited number of edits in recent days.</p>
<p><a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Kiss-the-cop">User contributions</a>, limited though they are, appear to be either creation of pages that then get deleted, or vandalism. An example is <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rio_Tinto_Group&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302026238" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Rio_Tinto_Group&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302026238">here</a>.</p>

<dd>The last three edits appear to be vandalism, so I have given the user a final warning. Normally I&#39;d say that <a href="" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a> would be the place for your concerns, but given the nature of article creation, speedy deletions, and now a pattern of vandalism, AN/I can certainly be of service. I really hope the user decides to consider the warning, but the pattern indicates a downward spiral. <a href="" title="User:Law">&#60;font color=&#34;Navy&#34;&#62;<b>Law</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;sub&#62; <a href="" title="User talk:Law">&#60;font color=&#34;Navy&#34;&#62;type!&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Law">&#60;font color=&#34;Navy&#34;&#62;snype?&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sub&#62; 12:08, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Contrary to Yaf&#39;s original assertion, my block of SB wasn&#39;t clear cut. Unusually, I did it on the basis of the reported diffs, rather than on looking through the history myself. Because of that, I missed SB&#39;s self revert. That made the block questionnable, and on another inspection I couldn&#39;t see 4 clear R. Furthermore, Yaf&#39;s failure to mention the self-rv showed bad faith. So I unblocked SB, because I was no longer happy to sustain the block. <a href="" title="User:William M. Connolley">William M.

<dd>have you considered my proposal? re: WND, I launched an exhaustive inquery into the nonreggies claim on Mr Jawesomes talk page on the website of both World Net Daily and several of its affiliates websites. There was no matches as can be evidenced <a class="externallink" href="http://www.wnd.com/search.asp?offsite" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.wnd.com/search.asp?offsite">here</a>. I think that Jawesome98 might have posted on WND&#39;s forum under a diferent username than the one he uses for Wikipedia, or maybe the non-reggie had him confused with someone else with similar plitical leanings. Anyway, I think it might be ared herring and not material to the nature of Orly Taitz <a href="" title="User:Smith Jones">Smith Jones</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Smith Jones">talk</a>) 18:56, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Just saw the last two entries about Jawesome98...  Why does everyone assume people are tag teaming?  This makes no sense.  Regardless...  I have already brought this matter up by asking the <a href="" title="WP:MEDCAB">Mediation Cabal</a> to review the actions of the two editors whom I believe have slowly lost their neutrality on this issue.  The reason I believe this is because over the three days I have been advocating this discussion, while my main facts have never been addressed, the administrator&#39;s demands went from &#34;Let&#39;s discuss this on the talk page&#34;, to &#34;Provide reliable sources&#34;, to &#34;This isn&#39;t relevant to the topic&#34;, to &#34;Everybody else believes this has been settled&#34;, to &#34;Only conspiracy theorists believe this&#34;, to &#34;This has already been discussed&#34;, all while still failing to address the main facts presented.</p>
<p>This discussion I brought up was going nowhere because *nobody* was responding to the facts I presented, or responding to the claims that were made based on those facts.  That doesn&#39;t mean the argument has no merit, it means the opposing viewpoint so far has not presented a defense.</p>

<dd>I take exception to the following: &#34;These users have worked together to make disruptive edits including vandalizing my talk page, and wikistalk articles I have created or contributed to and nominate them for deletion.&#34; ---I have never vandalized anyone&#39;s talk page or nominated any article for deletion. Therefore, I could not have wiki-stalked articles for deletion. Its true that a lot of article creation in California counties has been a cause for concern, if not occasional ire but the charges from <a href="" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> are unfounded or untrue. However at this time, I would make the point that it looks like said editor is willing to trump up charges against me over a difference of opinion related to the value of some (not all) of the articles created. I do not know what a sock is. I imagine it has something to do with a ghost account that an editor might use to look like someone else. But as far as I can see that has nothing to do with the articles in Humboldt County that I am mostly concerned with. It is true that I have been trying to make sense of the rapid article development as of late in many counties, but I have made mostly small adjustments related to some of additions in articles I know quite well. I think that is normal editing. No one has ownership of any article. In at least one case, I made a very clear point in the City of Arcata. If San Francisco was briefly called Yerba Buena why is it not listed as &#34;(formerly Yerba Buena)&#34; in its header. But the information related to use of Arcata&#39;s brief original name, that information was ALREADY cited and placed in the history section long before any more recent changes. As I read the interesting arguments about the use of GNIS I see that there has been much considerate deliberation. I hope it all leads to more complete, well organized articles and templates. But one thing is for sure at the moment. There are repetitions and errors in templates that are ill conceived by relying totally on the GNIS. The issue with Bucksport and Buck&#39;s Port in Humboldt County is one of the issues around recent prolific stub article creation that needs clarifying-there was only one and the same location, but references may have developed from old sources to confuse that. Even so, there should be an (single) entry about this (single) historic location now completely absorbed by the City of Eureka. Again, I have seen some similarity in concern in Mono County and Monterrey County for what I saw happening in Humboldt, but I have never wittingly worked together with anyone in the manner described above. It is not in my nature despite being upset at the onset of this period of massive article creation in many counties in California that I am familiar with. <a href="" title="User:Norcalal">Norcalal</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Norcalal">talk</a>)  05:21, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>What caused you to post on Highspeed&#39;s talk page about me on the day he vandalized my talk page? <a href="" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Carlossuarez46">talk</a>) 05:33, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I have no knowledge of vandalism from Highspeed toward you or anyone else. My perception was that he was having a similar reaction in Monterrey as I was having in Humboldt. The posts of his that I noted were only related to your edits/article creation that he tagged for &#34;speedy deletion&#34; related to obscure article stubs related to the GNIS source debate (a real debate going on parallel to this issue here). I assumed Good Faith (not knowing otherwise) and had no idea that he had tampered with anything. I still have not researched the claim of vandalism to your talk page...mostly because I only look for discussion on the GNIS issue, which has taught me quite a lot about the process of development around here. I track a lot of coastal articles (and their counties and templates for that matter) related to my many interests, so there is good reason for me to watch this issue and others in the larger California setting. My issue is only this: If you created an article related to a mistaken/misspelled name of a locale in GNIS, it will be difficult, if not impossible, to find a resource to say that a place that never was never existed. I resent being brought on trial here and lumped in with this &#34;Highspeed&#34; character because there is no connection. This is the last I will engage this discussion. <a href="" title="User:Norcalal">Norcalal</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Norcalal">talk</a>)
<dl>
<dd>So, you see that he is trying to delete geographic article - a kindred spirit you had no prior contact with and leave a negative comment about me after he vandalizes my talk page, which you didn&#39;t notice per <a href="" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>. OK. FWIW, if an article&#39;s title is mistaken/misspelled, you can always <a href="" title="WP:MOVE">WP:MOVE</a> it to its correct title, but after being here as long as you, I assume you know that. Just make sure that you have a reference that verifies that title.

<dd>I did not research why he was trying to delete an article, I saw others as well suggesting articles for deletion...again I assumed he was a real editor with a vested interest in the locale. You still seem surprised at the undertone of antagonism that comes your way. Perhaps your responses where you decide calling other editors a &#34;DICK&#34; might be inflammatory. I have not had a stranger call me that since the 7th grade so I know I was taken aback...perhaps others are/were too. On the flip side, I have had extraordinarily patient editors and admins have reason to be upset with a mistake I or others have made, take time to help make sense of it all and none of those reduce their interaction to orders and demands as you do. So whatever. Your use of &#34;Kindred spirit&#34; in the above may relate to what I expected (assumed) to find in Highspeed: A local editor in shock over your rapid article creation (without knowing otherwise). The statements made here and in other posts related to the GNIS mess as I see it are honest ones from an editor who has been here a while. I don&#39;t research everything in a controversy, just the stuff that matters to me. I bet in that respect I am not alone. <a href="" title="User:Norcalal">Norcalal</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Norcalal">talk</a>)  07:40, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>FWIW, I&#39;m sure I&#39;ve ever been called &#34;rapacious&#34; before. So we all have new experiences here. We&#39;re here to write an encyclopedia, to increase the knowledge available to the world. Where the inclusion of articles that are referenced is met with so much antagonism, attempts at deletion of notable articles with little more than &#34;it&#39;s not notable&#34; as a rationale, and now vandalism seems heavy handed. I&#39;m not saying that all the articles can be expanded quickly to more than stubs, but <a href="" title="Kneeland, California">Kneeland, California</a> demonstrates that is quite possible. Now, you know more first hand about Humboldt County than I do, but I can use sources that are <a href="" title="WP:RS">reliable</a> to put together a little something. Perhaps by focusing your efforts from deleting articles like Kneeland, you can put it into improving them and expanding them. Anyway, this seems resolved and I&#39;ll take you on your good faith that you didn&#39;t know Highspeed from before. And will mark it such. If you want to continue the conversation, my talk page is open.... <a href="" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Carlossuarez46">talk</a>) 17:03, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>My term &#34;rapacious&#34; resulted you AFTER you ordered me to move on AND after you called me a dick. Secondly, I have not deleted any articles. Even in the resolve (according to you) you sting because you can. It is unnecessary and you continue to retain the inflammatory tone that you are now, perhaps, (in)famous for. Thanks for that contribution. BTW, there are other editors, many of whom have been around for a good long while, who have questioned not only your reliance on GNIS and one other admin questioned your attitude of what could be described as bullying or heavy handed use of admin privilege. I will consider this resolved if you stop the attack of words. <a href="" title="User:Norcalal">Norcalal</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Norcalal">talk</a>)  03:14, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>As   has not edited in over nine months and may never return, perhaps there&#39;s no point in doing anything about this beyond what I&#39;m already doing, which is reviewing his uploads one-by-one, but this editor has repeatedly uploaded copyvio images he claims were self-created, and adding to other uploads FU rationales it&#39;d be hard to see as anything but bad-faith -- for instance, characterizing copyrighted photographic portraits of (living) human subjects as &#34;historically significant paintings&#34;.

This editor and I have clashed on any number of occasions and will likely continue to clash in the future. So take this concern for what it&#39;s worth, bearing that history in mind. I have no intention of getting into a he said/he said pissing match with him over this concern, so I hope that responses along the lines of &#34;well, Otto did such-and-such&#34; will not be allowed to draw focus from the concern at hand. Alansohn becomes very passionate about the CFD process. That&#39;s fine, I do too, again, this isn&#39;t about me. His passion leads him to adopt a number of inappropriate tactics in CFD discussions. His latest tactics, most recently employed <a href="#Category:Jurists_by_faith" title="Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2009_July_15">here</a>, is to rage against the system itself, deriding it as a &#34;game&#34;. He couples this tactic with a blanket accusation that deleting categories that he finds personally acceptable but that a CFD has found should be deleted is automatically &#34;disruption&#34;, the false assertion that categories are deleted because &#34;one editor doesn&#39;t like them&#34; and the distortion that editors routinely nominate categories, not for the reasons they state in their nominations, but again because they don&#39;t &#34;like&#34; the categories. Using any one of these tactics without some supporting evidence by <i>any</i> editor is enough to call the actions of that editor into question. Combining all of them and repeatedly employing them in what amount to boilerplate <i>keep</i> opinions constitutes an utter and abject failure to <a href="" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>. It is also blatant <a href="" title="WP:CIVIL">incivility</a>, which is bad enough in general but also particularly ironic given that Alansohn routinely accuses other editors of being uncivil toward him. I have repeatedly advised him of these concerns and asked him not to engage in such behaviour, to no avail. Whatever remedy the community feels is appropriate to stop this constant bad conduct is fine, but at the least I would hope the editor will be instructed to stop making bad-faith accusations about his fellow editors. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 20:37, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

I don&#39;t think that anything I have ever said or done in my 200,000 edits approaches any of this small sample of Otto&#39;s incivility problem, but I guess that his example may encourage me to be more brusk than I should be. I do agree that I should do a better job of ignoring Otto&#39;s provocations and will continue my efforts to deal with Otto&#39;s disruptions more productively and not respond in kind. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 22:25, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>1) You&#39;re suggesting that an angry outburst from April 2007, a year or more before I knew of your existence, serves as justification for your actions today. As noted in my opening remarks, &#34;Otto did such and such&#34; doesn&#39;t excuse your actions. 2) Neither your stated reliance or non-reliance on RS or V nor my opinions about them in relation to categorization has anything to do with your bad-faith accusations of disruption. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 22:55, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>If I may Alansohn, naturally, your pledge not to respond to pestering incivility with incivil responses is a good thing, but does not go to the matter at hand.  which seems to be that when you said &#34;In the disruptive game that is CfD, &#34;process&#34; only applies to anything necessary to delete categories any one editor doesn&#39;t like. Neither consensus nor reliable sources can stand in the way of this &#34;process&#34; that you were being dishonest in your characterization of previous consensus decisions as being the decision of one person, who was disruptively gaming the system.  The suggestion was not that you were using naughty words, but that your failure to attribute good faith to the views of the community when it opposes your views amounts to disruption.  &#60;span style=&#34;font-size: smaller;&#34; class=&#34;autosigned&#34;&#62;—Preceding <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/142.58.118.218">142.58.118.218</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:142.58.118.218">talk</a>) 22:57, 15 July 2009 (UTC)&#60;/span&#62;&#60;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&#62; &#60;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&#62;

<p>I&#39;m tending to agree with AGK here: lots of heat &#38; smoke but no light. So Alansohn thinks the processes in a given forum is a joke. I&#39;ve thought that too, if I haven&#39;t voiced it. However, unless someone wants to provide diffs that show Alansohn was incivil or abusive in stating that opinion, please take this dispute elsewhere -- &#38; maybe that would be best not back to WP:CfD. -- <a href="" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Llywrch">talk</a>) 00:03, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Unfortunately I don&#39;t have every instance of Alansohn&#39;s incivility bookmarked, but a quick look back yields a few diffs. I can look for more, especially those that establish his pattern of bad-faith accusations. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACategories_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2009_May_24&#38;diff=292063202&#38;oldid=292062615" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACategories_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2009_May_24&#38;diff=292063202&#38;oldid=292062615">here</a> he suggests that I&#39;m ignorant. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACategories_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2009_May_22&#38;diff=292060008&#38;oldid=292058080" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ACategories_for_discussion%2FLog%2F2009_May_22&#38;diff=292060008&#38;oldid=292058080">here</a> he suggests I&#39;m &#34;foolish&#34; and &#34;nonsensical&#34; and uses the same attack language in his edit summary. In <a href="#Category:Americans_accused_of_spying_for_the_Soviet_Union" title="Wikipedia:DRV">this DRV</a> he makes the rather serious accusation that administrators are vote-stacking through the use of so-called &#34;supervotes&#34; and makes the bad-faith accusations that the closing admin engaged in &#34;clear administrative misconduct&#34; and that he and other unnamed admins are &#34;pushing a personal agenda&#34;. When asked to offer proof, his response was &#34;res ipsa loquitur&#34; (along with an acknowledgement of months spent tracking my movements). <a href="#Imprisoned" title="Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2009_July_9">Another bad-faith accusation of disruption</a>. <a href="#Category:African_American_atheists_and_agnostics" title="Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2009_July_8">A bad-faith accusation of &#34;abuse&#34; and of the nominator nominating a category because he doesn&#39;t like it</a>. There are plenty of others. In too many instances, Alansohn&#39;s first line of approach in discussing a CFD or DRV is to claim that the process is defective, that deleting categories is &#34;disruptive&#34;, that nominating categories is &#34;abuse&#34; and that the people making and supporting the nomination are doing so solely because they do not &#34;like&#34; the category. At DRV he often adds accusations of bad conduct and bad faith on the part of closing admins. His intent seems to be to shift the focus of the discussion from the relative merits of the category to the motive and character of other participants. It&#39;s quite telling that his response to this discussion was not to discuss the specifics of the situation at hand but to go bak into his bookmarked diffs to attempt to shift the focus away from his conduct and try to make this about me, along with blaming me for his inability to control himself. If the consensus is that he&#39;s violated his editing restrictions (I knew he was under some restriction but did not know the specifics until reading the above link) then he should be subject to the sanction called for by those restrictions. If not then at the very least the result of this discussion should be that Alansohn is put on notice that continued bad-faith accusations and claims will result in sanctions. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 04:35, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I see nothing recent that would be grounds for a block. Apparently, neither has anyone else.

<dd>I looked at the diffs Otto provided &#38; independently came to much the same conclusion as Tan. While his language in the first two diffs are borderline, they are fairly close to his last block &#38; could be either momentary slips or poor choices of words: nowhere close to falling under the terms of his restrictions. Incidentally, in the other two cases Otto linked to, Alansohn interacted with Good Ol&#39;factory -- the same Admin who blocked him twice -- &#38; had Alansohn been out of line I trust he would have done something like given him a warning, a block, or asked another Admin to block Alansohn. BTW, I note the last time Alansohn &#38; Otto4711 were blocked was the same day. In other words, &#34;Pot. Kettle. Black.&#34; Let&#39;s move on now. -- <a href="" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Llywrch">talk</a>) 05:45, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Otto does not distinguish between what he sees as incivility -- of the type best evidenced by his vicious personal attacks and repeated use of the most vulgar profanities and insults -- and issues raised regarding legitimate concerns of use of Wikipedia policy. Where there are such concerns they have been raised, and calling discussion of these issues at DRV &#34;incivility&#34;, especially where a half-dozen other editors have raised the same concerns in the same discussion, is not evidence of a real issue. Any and all editing restrictions expired a month ago, as Otto is well aware. As stated above, I will work further to avoid further provocations and trolling from Otto and to ensure that any comments focus exclusively on issues directly related to Wikipedia policy. I have made repeated suggestions to Otto to try to work cooperatively to de-escalate his conflict, which he has consistently refused to accept (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Otto4711&#38;diff=255836829&#38;oldid=255806097" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Otto4711&#38;diff=255836829&#38;oldid=255806097">see here for an example</a>). Any suggestions from uninvolved editors to help mitigate further conflict with Otto will be greatly appreciated. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 05:14, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Protonk, hi. As I said at <a href="" title="WP:WQA">WP:WQA</a>.... &#34;A good block summary identifies the specific behavior that the block is intended to prevent. It&#39;s not a message to the person being blocked; it&#39;s a record of who blocked whom, and why. I haven&#39;t suggested that WMC&#39;s summary was uncivil, but I have suggested that it was callow and unprofessional. I stand by that, and I&#39;ll add that such block summaries make the logs less useful.&#34; &#60;p&#62; Yeah. That&#39;s my issue with it. It&#39;s not an example of &#34;best practices&#34;.

I nominated both of these articles for deletion because they do not meet the general notability requirements of <a href="" title="WP:UNIGUIDE">WP:UNIGUIDE</a> and because they contain <a href="" title="WP:IINFO">Indiscriminate list</a> of fraternities and sororities.</p>
<p>The user contends that this is vandalism because I am an alumni of a rival school, and because our schools <a href="" title="Greek Life at the University of Central Florida">Greek Life</a> page was nominated for deletion a week ago. I explained to the user that I nominated Greek Life articles that did not met the preceding requirements, leaving others that meet the requirements. One can check this. I nominated four or five separate articles. In addition, the user is using their rollback privileges to do this. Rollback privileges are not supposed to be used in articles unless it is a clear violation of policy, which these edits are not. Even if someone believes that I did do this for vandalism purposes, which is open to your own interpretation, the articles nomination for deletion lists valid reasons and the user can list their respective grievances on the articles nomination for deletion page.</p>
<p>As well, the editors user page states that he is <i>&#34;RETIRED - no longer active on Wikipedia&#34;</i>, when fact he is. This is purposefully misleading.

<p>I am a proud UCF Alumni of 1986, and while I am not a big UF or FSU fan, the nomination for deletion lists valid reasons and should not be removed willy nilly because this one editor believes it bias, that is what the debate is for.</p>

<li>Look the fact is <a href="" title="User:Scpmarlins">User:Scpmarlins</a> only decided to nominate to delete the UF/FSU Greek Life articles after another poster nominated the deletion of <a href="" title="Greek Life at the University of Central Florida">Greek Life at the University of Central Florida</a>. The poster also started the Wikiproject University of Central Florida, and copied wikiproject UF and wikiproject FSU to a tee. Also the posters has not done a mass purge of Greek Life articles on Wikipedia (you only nominated 3 total). Scpmarlins specifically targeted UF &#38; FSU. Also the posters is in fact guilty of deleting the nomination for deletion for the UCF Greek Life article, and then tried to cover it up on the poster&#39;s <a href="" title="User talk:Scpmarlins">talk page</a>.<a href="" title="User:Jccort">Jccort</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Jccort">talk</a>) 02:40, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>I did in fact nominate the Greek Life articles only after the UCF article was nominated. I will not debate that. Yet FSU and UF were not singled out, 4 were nominated for deletion. As well I never deleted the &#34;AfD&#34; tag on the <a href="" title="Greek Life at the University of Central Florida">Greek Life at the University of Central Florida</a> page (As you can see for yourself). I argued my point on the pages article for deletion page as is policy. The part, as you mention, that was deleted was the notification on my <a href="" title="User talk:Scpmarlins">talk page</a>. As per the WikiProject, I have edited the page, on my own time, so that it is no longer like UF or FSU&#39;s. --<a href="" title="User:Scpmarlins">Scpmarlins</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Scpmarlins">talk</a>) 02:53, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Complaint_Against_User:Tanthalas39_for_Abuse_of_Admin_Authority">Complaint Against <a href="" title="User:Tanthalas39">User:Tanthalas39</a> for Abuse of Admin Authority</span></h2>

<p> 
 </p>
<p>This is a formal complaint against admin <a href="" title="User:Tanthalas39">User:Tanthalas39</a>.  </p>
<p>Tan and I were engaged in a discussion in <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Repeated_false_Accusations_and_Insults_by_User_Supreme_Deliciousness_.28SD.29" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents#Repeated_false_Accusations_and_Insults_by_User_Supreme_Deliciousness_.28SD.29">this thread</a>, in which Tan digressed the original complaint by <a href="" title="User:Nefer Tweety">User:Nefer Tweety</a> to a discussion about &#34;Congress&#34; and &#34;Freedom of Speech&#34;.  Other users chipped in with their own jargon; what appeared to be &#34;insider jokes&#34; using Wikipedia coined terms such as &#34;ducks&#34;, which they did not link to their respective pages.  When I tried to steer the discussion back to the original complaint, Tan issued a vague, unitelligible &#34;warning&#34; in the same thread of discussion in which he was personally involved.  A couple of minutes later, Tan blocked my account for 72 hours.</p>
<p>Tan&#39;s &#34;warning,&#34; <i>&#34;AC, knock off the disruption here. This constitutes an only warning,&#34;</i> was ambiguous, written in informal English, and not understood by me.  Before I had the chance to ask for clarification, Tan had already blocked my account, obviously to stifle further response from me to the discussion in which he was participating, so as to not oppose his oppinion.  Tan did not place a formally written warning on my Talk page with proper links to the alleged violation, <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Wikipedia:Disruptive editing</a>.  In fact, when Tan finally placed a block on my Talk page, within minutes of his unintelligible &#34;warning&#34; within the thread on this page, he claimed that I had been blocked for <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a>.  I had no idea what &#34;disruptive editing&#34; was, and Tan provided no link to that page or offer me a chance to inquire about it.  I certainly had not vandalised any articles or other pages.  I have since reviewed the pages related to Disruptive Editing and Vandalism and have found that my responses within the thread in reference were <b>very far</b> from either violation.  In any case, <b>I have served the 72-hour block period and the case is now agaisnt Tan for abuse of administrative privileges</b>.</p>
<p>This is clearly a case of <b>abuse of administrative authority due to Conflict of Interest (COI) and not following proper, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Warnings|official" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Warnings|official">Wikipedia warning guidelines</a></b>.   It was, in fact, Tan and the other users who were engaged in disruptive editing by digressing the discussion to matters unrelated to the original complaint and engaging in insider jokes.  Tan should have asked for an uninterested admin to review the thread and issue a proper warning, if necessary, to the offending parties, since he had already been party to the discussion in the thread.</p>

<dd>The warning looked perfectly unambiguous and fine to me.  By the way, did you read the top of the page where it states &#34;<i>For incidents involving the possible misuse of administrative powers, please attempt to engage in discussions with the admin before posting here.</i>&#34;?  Trying to get back at someone after a block never ends well...

<dd>You&#39;ve come to the wrong place.  ANI is thoroughly hostile to everyone.  New users get bitten (hard), experience users are trashed, editors bicker, a few editors throw insults that&#39;d get others blocked PDQ.  &#39;abandon hope&#39; etc.  There are still a couple of things you can&#39;t do on ANI - Biography of Living Persons would be enforced, and you couldn&#39;t directly call another editor a useless fucking cunt (although thinking about it, there&#39;s possibly a few situations where you&#39;d get away with it).  The thread you link to is unfortunate - many people continue to accuse you of being a sock when you&#39;re complaining that people are calling you a sock.&#60;br /&#62;</dd>
<dd>PERHAPS someone might help you with a technical process where you can demonstrate that you&#39;re not a sock account?&#60;br /&#62;</dd>
<dd>Perhaps you can explain why you did not understand the warning?  It seems clear to me.  Were you expecting a series of templates?

<li>Phoe, On reading <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Wikipedia:Disruptive editing</a> and even <a href="" title="WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT">Refusal to &#39;get the point&#39;</a>, they seem to refer to the editing of Wikipedia articles, not discussions on a page like this one.  But, this is besides the point of this complaint.</li>
<li>87.113.86.207, I did not understand the warning because I did not know that &#34;knock off the disruption here&#34; was in reference to a &#34;coined&#34; Wikipedia violation, <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Disruptive editing">Wikipedia:Disruptive editing</a> that has a formal definition.  I did not understand the warning because Tan did not give me the chance to ask him to elaborate; the block came exactly 2 minutes after my response, which edit-conflicted with his &#34;warning&#34;.  I did not understand the warning, because Tan had not identified himself as an admin earlier on in the discussion or while issuing the warning; anyone could have written that statement without having any authority to block, and it is clear that users bicker here all the time.  I did not understand the warning because it was not placed on my Talk page with a proper link to the alleged violation of which I was being warned.  I did not understand the warning because Tan had been sarcastically involved in the discussion prior to issuing the &#34;warning&#34;.  How could he turn around and issue a warning just to enforce his point of view?</li>
<li>I&#39;ve had two respected admins write to me in private indicating that my complaint is indeed legitimate and that Tan may have very well abused his authority on the grounds that I listed.  I&#39;d rather they posted on this page at their own convenience.</li>
<li><b>It is clear that people here are again digressing from the main complaint.  This thread is NOT about whether I deserved the warning, or even whether the warning was ambiguous.</b>  I have already served the 72-hour block duration.  The issue here is about whether Tan abused his admin authority in issuing the warning through: (a) conflict of interest (he was engaged in the discussion and issued the warning to enforce his opinion, and never identified himself as an admin in the midst of &#34;insider jokers&#34;); (b) not requesting an uninvolved admin to review the thread and have that admin issue a proper warning and/or block, where necessary; and (c) not following formal warning guidelines by placing the warning with a link to the respective alleged violation on my Talk page and allowing me enough time to view and comprehend it.</li></ul></dd>

<p>Frankly this doesn&#39;t read well from the start. ArabCowboy doesn&#39;t start well when he misrepresents the situation (Tan warned him then a couple of minutes later issued a block? Tan warned him at quarter past, he then continued alng the disruptive vein at 20 past and after that was blocked). It appears Tan typo&#39;d in the warning (or used a very odd form of local grammar) but it is far easier to understand than some of our English as a Secondary Language users&#39; normal typing style so I can&#39;t see it as being unreasonable for ArabCowboy to be expected to understand it. The accusation of CoI presumes that Tan was in conflict with ArabCowboy. He wasn&#39;t that I can see. If we ban admin from dealing with any situation that arises in a thread or page on which they have commented, we have made these noticeboards rather pointless. &#60;span style=&#34;font-famiy: verdana;&#34;&#62; --<a href="" title="User:Narson">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#1100;&#34;&#62;<b>Narson</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> ~ <a href="" title="User_talk:Narson">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#900;&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;</a> • &#60;/span&#62; 12:07, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

No, the problem lies in the wording of the message: &#34;I am pretty sure the proposal is another religiously motivated one.

It also demonstrates a clear lack of good faith: <i>nowhere</i> at the AfD did I (the nominator) or any &#34;delete&#34; voter express religious-based reasoning for deletion. Every deletion rationale is firmly grounded in policy.

<p>I&#39;ve noted that there is a IP-hopping vandal who has been attacking several user and user talk pages, including mine. Here are the list of IPs that attacked my talk page alone during the last six months:</p>

<ul>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li></ul>

<p>And it&#39;s not just me, as the vandal has also regularly attacked some, if not all of, the following editors&#39; user and talk pages as well:</p>

<ul>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li></ul>

<p>I don&#39;t have any connections with these users and I don&#39;t usually edit the pages they edit, so I don&#39;t know why this vandal decided to put my name on his list.</p>
<p>Any kind of help against this vandal is surely welcome as this guy giving me some inconvenience on my talk page. (In fact, this guy attacks, although under different usernames and addresses, are the reason my user page is semi-protected; I&#39;d tried to have my user talk page semi-protected as well, but my request was refused.) - <a href="" title="User: Nanami Kamimura">上村七美 (Nanami-chan)</a> | &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk: Nanami Kamimura">talkback</a> | <a href="" title="Special: Contributions/Nanami Kamimura">contribs</a>&#60;/small&#62; 09:45, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;ve given   a long block, as it has been a repeat abuse vector; looking into the possibility of further responses.

<dd>The bulk of addresses on this range -- with the notable and confusing exception of the one I blocked -- seem to be dynamic, and therefore unlikely to be used by a single user over a prolonged period. Bearing in mind that I could be wrong, a longer block on a dynamic IP doesn&#39;t accomplish anything if the vandal has moved on to another IP by the time the block expires. If you&#39;ve ever wondered why vandals on IPs seem to get counter-intuitively short blocks, at times, that has a lot to do with it. :) If they come back on that IP, though, I&#39;d certainly bring down the thunder. – &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User:Luna Santin">&#60;font color=&#34;#28f&#34;&#62;Luna Santin&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 10:30, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I see your point there because, according to my talk page&#39;s history, it seems the same guy has also vandalized my user and talk pages (and possibly the others) last year under the following:

<p>Hi, yesterday I was blocked for some hours, because I reverted a notorious German vandal, who is an admin in de too. I have my own thoughts about his motivation, but the fact is that he has a special meaning about pop idol contestant Annemarie Eilfeld, which he executes as an admin in de. And he tries this now in the same matter in en. For a quick review you need only two eyes and no knowledge of the German language.(as Tanthalas:<i>(Protected Annemarie Eilfeld: persistent unsourced additions/speculation/external links)</i>

<dd>I looked at the history of this article, &#38; for the life of me I can&#39;t figure out what the dispute is about. At most, there appears to be a dispute over whether one Tom Saenger of RTL played a part in her selection on DSdS -- which could be settled by supplying a source. BTW, I seriously doubt anyone with the Admin bit is a &#34;vandal&#34; -- maybe someone who emphatically disagrees with you. If any editor goes around inserting nonsense into articles or blanking them, that person will lose Administrator rights rather quickly. -- <a href="" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Llywrch">talk</a>) 16:20, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>oh, so there are &#34;serious problems with my conduct heretofore&#34;... let&#39;s say &#34;my conduct towards somebody bothering since weeks on de.wp already, someone who is calling me and other users vandals, someone who is talking about us &#34;fakers&#34; all the time, someone who...&#34; - the same holds true to earlier contribs of user:buchweizen on de.wp: &#34;wannabe insider&#34;, &#34;wikipedia means &#39;anti annemarie board&#39; for JD&#34;,...</dd>
<dd>i&#39;ve given my point of view many times now, i think. this edit-war has its beginning @de.wp where, for example, the IP already had revert wars with other users; later, user:buchweizen came up from the official bulletin board and being rude many times for which he got warnings; now exactly the same arguments occur on en.wp. it&#39;s obvious - at least to me - that i am not the nice guy then who behaves like he has first contact with some new editor here. even if i surpassed 3RR one has to have a look at the edits by the IP which often even had wrong edit summaries to camouflage the real purpose (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annemarie_Eilfeld&#38;diff=301720602&#38;oldid=301700366" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annemarie_Eilfeld&#38;diff=301720602&#38;oldid=301700366">repaired broken link + sources</a>, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annemarie_Eilfeld&#38;diff=301948267&#38;oldid=301929143" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annemarie_Eilfeld&#38;diff=301948267&#38;oldid=301929143">+</a>, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annemarie_Eilfeld&#38;diff=302138088&#38;oldid=302122143" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annemarie_Eilfeld&#38;diff=302138088&#38;oldid=302122143">++</a>, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annemarie_Eilfeld&#38;diff=302218328&#38;oldid=302217245" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Annemarie_Eilfeld&#38;diff=302218328&#38;oldid=302217245">that&#39;s the best link you can get.

<dd>ehm...? you&#39;re mixing it all up. eilfeld IS not a &#34;super-bitch&#34; but she was pushed into some kind of ROLE. but the labelling itself as &#34;super-bitch&#34; came through other, reporting media. RTL never said &#34;we gave her the role of the super-bitch&#34;. that would be hilarious, wouldn&#39;t it? and yes, GZST doesn&#39;t want her again in that role. the latter doesn&#39;t have anything to do with the role before nevertheless. --<a href="" title="User:JD">JD</a> <a href="" title="User talk:JD">{æ}</a> 22:13, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>I must say this topic is new to me, but I can confirm that JD is correct in noting that the statement &#39;Eilfeld ... was pushed by Tom Sänger ... into the role of a &#34;super-bitch&#34;&#39; inserted by the IP was a <a href="" title="WP:BLP">wild extrapolation</a> from what the source says.

<dd>You can prove or just believe me, that I NEVER have molested an article with stuff which i <i>think</i>. I prefer the spurs of the alpha-guys in the web. Tom Sänger was successful in making DSDS6 the most successful German show of the year between May 2008 and May 2009. Before they were afraid, that Nr.6 will get too boring. So they changed the show from a song contest to a reality tv show. And they were lucky. But Eilfeld has still some problems after the show, because of this image. And she has a contract to be quiet. But she&#39;s testing the border of being quiet with some stories here, there and there. <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/79.194.85.57">79.194.85.57</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:79.194.85.57">talk</a>) 21:00, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>So...I&#39;m just cruising along...minding my own business...when in the recent changes, I see <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stewart_Downing&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302437233" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Stewart_Downing&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302437233">this edit summary</a>.

Pretty straightforward block...except I saw he was a brand new user and no one had given him a 3RR warning...so I <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Danwilson82&#38;diff=302437612&#38;oldid=302435760" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Danwilson82&#38;diff=302437612&#38;oldid=302435760">do just that</a>.

<p>I would have a bit of sympathy with him, although his attitude it a bit ott, but he is new. Can someone not trim the picture to only show his head, because until the new fans have a picture it will continue.

<dd>There&#39;s an existing picture (albeit a poor quality one) in the article which is appropriately liscenced, see <a href="" title="File:Stewart Downing Middlesbrough v. Chelsea 1.png">File:Stewart Downing Middlesbrough v. Chelsea 1.png</a>.  Per <a href="" title="WP:IUP">WP:IUP</a>, we may not replace a free image with a copyright image merely for image quality or other such trivial matters.  If someone takes a new picture themselves, and releases it under a free-use lisence, then it may be valid to replace the current image.  However, it is <b>never</b> kosher to replace a free, properly lisenced image with a copyrighted one.  Also, one cannot merely crop or modify the existing image; such modifications still are based on a copyrigthed work, and the copyright protection carries to the cropped image.  So no, merely cutting his headshot out of the copyright image will not solve the problem. --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="WP:NODRAMA">&#60;small&#62;say <b>no</b> to drama&#60;/small&#62;</a> 19:02, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Edit conflict. :Thanks.

<p>I think that you&#39;re all missing the core of the issue.

<li>No one&#39;s missing it. It was a copyrighted image, which is why it was deleted. --<a href="" title="User:Smashville"><b>Smashville</b></a><a href="" title="User Talk:Smashville">&#60;sup style=&#34;color:#03F&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 13:40, 17 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The fact that you&#39;re talking about copyright here indicates that you <i>are</i>, <i>still</i>, missing the core of the issue.  Address the underlying problem, revealed in that edit, and the symptom, the edit war, will go away by itself.  <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 14:28, 17 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You do realize that the only thing I ever did to him was shoot him a 3RR warning...right? In all actuality...the picture and the content of said picture is irrelevant to his attitude. --<a href="" title="User:Smashville"><b>Smashville</b></a><a href="" title="User Talk:Smashville">&#60;sup style=&#34;color:#03F&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 16:08, 17 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The edit war is caused by a misunderstanding of the image copyright policy.  It&#39;s not his picture; evidenced by the fact that multiple accounts keep showing up to add it.  A new one just left a note on my talkpage overnight regarding this very issue.  If someone wants to take a new picture and upload it themselves, that would all be fine.  However, this specific picture is <a class="externallink" href="http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/0,,10265~1724710,00.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.avfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/0,,10265~1724710,00.html">clearly incompatable</a> with our <a href="" title="WP:IUP">image use policy</a>.  I know the current picture is outdated, but is IS appropriately liscenced, and the IUP is clear; it is inapprorpriate to upload an updated, but copyright photo when a free one is availible.  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="WP:NODRAMA">&#60;small&#62;say <b>no</b> to drama&#60;/small&#62;</a> 17:02, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><i>You do realize that the only thing I ever did to him was shoot him a 3RR warning...right?</i> &#38;mdash; That&#39;s the thing.  The edit war and the copyright issue are all that have been the focus here, and all that anyone has ever said to this novice editor is about copyrights and mysterious &#34;revert rules&#34;.  The <i>editor</i>, meanwhile, has a quite different perspective.  From <i>xyr</i> perspective, as can be seen by reading the aforementioned edit, the problem is that the article has a misleading picture on it, showing this person in the <i>wrong team colours</i>.&#60;p&#62;See the issue from the perspective of the editor, who is focussed upon bringing article content up to date.  In particular see it from the perspective of a novice editor who didn&#39;t understand copyright policy, had never heard of a three-revert rule, and who merely saw other people <i>repeatedly putting an incorrect picture back</i> on the article.  And whilst you are doing so, remember how &#38;hellip; ahem! &#38;mdash; let&#39;s say &#38;hellip; <i>enthusiastic</i> sports fans can become about team-related matters.  (I almost wrote &#34;fanatical&#34;.  &#38;#9786;)&#60;p&#62;All that&#39;s really needed here is to <i>tell the editor the right way to scratch xyr itch</i>.  Tell xem that all that&#39;s required is for xem to take xyr own photograph of the player in the right team colours, now that the player has transferred, and to release that photograph under CC-BY-SA or the GFDL.  There are lots of boilerplated warnings about copyrights, revert rules, personal attacks, and so forth at <a href="" title="User talk:Danwilson82">User talk:Danwilson82</a> and <a href="" title="User talk:Smashville">User talk:Smashville</a>, but no mention at all of how the editor can go about fixing the problem that <i>xe sees</i>.  To do so will eliminate the very grounds for the edit war in the first place.  You never know, xe might turn out to be capable of taking and providing a lot of free-content photographs of sports players.  But no-one has even hinted to xem that xe can even <i>do</i> that.&#60;p&#62;See things through the novice&#39;s eyes.  <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 18:36, 17 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Where does it look at any point like the editor cared what I had to say? I left him a 3RR warning and he went on the offensive. --<a href="" title="User:Smashville"><b>Smashville</b></a><a href="" title="User Talk:Smashville">&#60;sup style=&#34;color:#03F&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 19:59, 17 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have to agree with Smashville here. He left a boilerplate warning (where all of the WikiJargon is helpfully linked for explanation), &#38; instead of responding with something along the lines of &#34;I don&#39;t understand; please explain&#34; -- or any other reasonable response, this person responds with &#34;Hello, I have read the dispute resolution page and have decided to give you the benefit of the doubt on a situation.&#34; (I don&#39;t understand what &#34;dispute resolution&#34; has to do with &#34;edit war&#34;, let alone &#34;three-revert rule&#34;.) Then <i>xe</i> proceeds to accuse Smashville of edit-warring with <i>xyr</i> over this image. (Or maybe <i>xe</i> thinks Smashville is edit-warring with himself: note the commment, &#34;I would like to kindly ask you to either put my picture back up or leave it removed.&#34;) Maybe this person doesn&#39;t realize that there are a number of people contributing to Wikipedia, just like <i>xyr</i>, but this would indicate a failure of comprehension of the other person&#39;s part; had Smashville responded &#34;I didn&#39;t edit this page, I&#39;m just warning you about this&#34;, maybe the other person wouldn&#39;t have understood that statement. Maybe if Smashville had suggested how <i>xem</i> could fix the problem, <i>xyr</i> would have responded &#34;I don&#39;t have any other images, except for this one.&#34; I honestly don&#39;t know. But this interaction did go off the rails near the very beginning -- if not before -- &#38; it doesn&#39;t appear to be getting back ontrack soon. -- <a href="" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Llywrch">talk</a>) 21:24, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<ul>
<li>In line with my often-stated stance that I encourage not piling on additional block time for users who vent after being blocked, I would like to request that other administrators not extend the block.  I am not suprised but nor was the comment anywhere near threatening enough to worry or offend me under the circumstances.  If Giano cannot be civil 24 hrs from now, he is unlikely to be more civil in 48 or 72 hrs or a week from now.  I AGF that he will not continue the particular behavior immediately in any case.  <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Georgewilliamherbert">talk</a>) 21:23, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Though I don&#39;t endorse or oppose the initial divination of &#34;a rapid but significant consensus&#34; by Gwh, extending the block would be punitive and would serve no real purpose other than punishment. <a href="" title="User talk:Unitanode">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;font-variant:small-caps;color:#63739F;font-weight:normal&#34;&#62;Unitanode&#60;/span&#62;</a> 21:27, 16 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Persistently showing poor conduct after being blocked, whether you&#39;re acting that way while blocked or not is irrelevant. An extension would serve far more than punishment, in fact, not punishment at all. —&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Mythdon">Mythdon</a>&#60;/font&#62; (&#60;font color=&#34;teal&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Mythdon">talk</a>&#60;/font&#62; • &#60;font color=&#34;teal&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Mythdon">contribs</a>&#60;/font&#62;) 21:31, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>At some point we need to recognise that the current way of doing things is not preventing Giano from making outrageous personal attacks whenever he feels like it. Here&#39;s what happens: Giano makes some attack. He gets blocked. DRAMA. Someone else unblocks him. MOAR DRAMA. We wait a couple weeks or months, and then Giano makes some attack. He gets blocked. DRAMA. Someone else unblocks him. MOAR DRAMA. We wait a couple weeks or months...</li>
<li>Nothing is working to prevent these outbursts. Either he needs to be community banned (unlikely, to say the least; DRAMA), or the blocks need to be of significant duration in order to prevent more attacks coming. →&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#36454F;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>ROUX</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#36454F;&#34;&#62;<b>₪</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;small&#62;&#38;nbsp;21:34, 16 July 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;</li></ul></li></ul>

<dd>Why the hell should I assume you&#39;ll be able to do anything more than has happened when I have done just that? My experience is that providing evidence of abusive behaviour by admins just results in an increase of the same behaviour. I have, as a result of my experiences, no confidence whatsoever in any admin unless they have already shewn themselves to be committed to honourable and decent behaviour in a discussion which I have been following. I am sorry if you find that upsetting, but that is what my experience of editing wikipedia has taught me. We are not allowed to compile evidence on-wiki of such behaviour by admins (even though some admins do compile such evidence against non-admins), and far too few admins are actually prepared to call out their abusive colleagues. <a href="" title="User:DuncanHill">DuncanHill</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DuncanHill">talk</a>) 23:04, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>Pedro, I think lifting this block will result in damage to Wikipedia. It&#39;s already been established and agreed that the edits consisted of some personal attacks, that despite being warned the personal attacks continued (and reverts that reinstated them) and that the editor in question doesn&#39;t agree they weren&#39;t acceptable and showed no intention of stopping. By unblocking, you will send a clear message (yet again) that it is acceptable for this particular editor to consistently attack other editors that he doesn&#39;t like and to destabilize any discussion he doesn&#39;t agree with into <a href="" title="ad hominem">ad hominem</a>, rather than a discussion about the issues. By letting him know that his deliberately disruptive argumentation methods are acceptable you also send a clear message to every other editor that they should also use those same methods because they are effective and tolerated, which further contributes to the (allegedly) &#34;broken&#34; Wikipedia. In short, by unblocking you say <i>&#34;you are exempt from the rules and it&#39;s OK for you to derail discussions by diverting them into personal attacks&#34;</i> <a href="" title="User:Ha!">Ha!</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ha!">talk</a>) 23:21, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>@Malleus: Totting up, that makes 722.5 hours! :) Seriously, I wonder about some of these blocks too. Giano criticising Durova for her behaviour on a Wiki-political page where everyone, including Durova, is claiming the moral high-ground and holding forth on WHAT IS GOOD/BAD FOR THE PROJECT is not the same as a hapless editor being called a fuckwit for making a content edit by someone they&#39;ve only just met. In my view, it&#39;s the latter situation that <a href="" title="WP:CIVILITY">WP:CIVILITY</a> should primarily be for, to ensure there is a welcoming culture. But this is not the situation between Giano and Durova. Even friends argue sometimes; loving husbands and wives have at times been known to turn into over-the-top grumpsters ... As important as civility is, this nanny attitude of locking people in the cupboard for saying a bad word is itself in danger of becoming ridiculous, stifling and disrespectful; you don&#39;t treat adults that way in real life. <b>&#60;font color=&#34;#0000FF&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Jayen466">JN</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34; #FFBF00&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_Talk:Jayen466">466</a>&#60;/font&#62;</b> 23:34, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>On the contrary, many long-term editors with a track record of quality contributions to articles stand to be driven off the project if people are allowed to call them &#34;stupid&#34; and &#34;racist&#34; and other such personal attacks if it is left unchecked.  The whole point is that no one should be given a free pass for creating a hostile environment for any reason.  It is possible to vehemently disagree with a person, and to still not create a hostile environment by calling them base names or defaming their character.  That all being said, if Durova wants to let this slide, I would think that we all could, since the attacks were directed at her.  However, in general, we should never let anyone perform such acts against another user.  Its not about avoiding swear words (fuck that) or about not engaging other editors when you disagree with them.  Its about not resorting to name calling and defamation when doing so.  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="WP:NODRAMA">&#60;small&#62;say <b>no</b> to drama&#60;/small&#62;</a> 23:45, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I couldn&#39;t agree more; I&#39;m of the opinion that we should all strive to behave in a civil and professional manner, and that we should enforce the civility policy where appropriate. But what good is the block doing at this point? Ideally blocks should be used to prevent damage to the encyclopedia, and while what Giano said was not acceptable by any means, the block is currently <i>harming</i> the encyclopedia by stirring up drama, creating grudges, and inducing stress. I&#39;m not doubting the block was necessary at the time, but I endorse Durova&#39;s motion. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 01:19, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>There seems to be significant experienced administrator input that the block was good and should run its (24 hr) course.  I understand the input here about reducing.  I think that it may minimize drama all around if this one actually runs to its initial duration and simply expires, though.  Another user making those comments would not have had large quantities of discussion and support and detractors show up.  I understand the argument that drama / stress may be minimized by just moving past this, but perhaps simply treating the abuse and block as if it were any normal user will also help minimize drama and stress.  <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Georgewilliamherbert">talk</a>) 00:53, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

Nor do I see any claim on Durova&#39;s part that this &#34;olive branch&#34; is being offered in anything but the best of faith, without any apparent conditions. While you haven&#39;t come out and said as much, the tone of your language seems to indicate that you believe other users are acting abusively, unusually, or maliciously, and with respect I&#39;m not seeing any obvious reason to take that leap with you. – &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User:Luna Santin">&#60;font color=&#34;#28f&#34;&#62;Luna Santin&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 03:54, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I have in fact read the thread and understand that GWH engaged in a block based on &#34;a rapid but significant consensus&#34; that may or may not have existed (an action that has not gone unquestioned). His action certainly doesn&#39;t seem to have limited the amount of disruption. Durova and Giano are adults, and sometimes people say things that are kind of mean. It&#39;s best to try to work it out with the least collateral damage wouldn&#39;t you say? But I was willing to let the block itself go as being well intentioned and within reason, and was trying to focus on moving forward. There seems to be clear and abundant consensus in favor of moving forward except for a couple of hold outs including the blocking admin himself who is certain the full 24 hours will be doubly helpful despite all the evidence to the contrary. This same admin was quick to find a consensus for his dramatic block, but heaven forbid anyone suggests the most civil and respectful action would be to unblock in good faith, it&#39;s as if we&#39;re raising some outlandish and far fetched suggestion that is incomprehensible. <a href="" title="User:ChildofMidnight">ChildofMidnight</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ChildofMidnight">talk</a>) 04:12, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I notice you&#39;ve dropped several of your accusations and traded them for new ones, the moment I questioned the first set and asked for specifics, and I can&#39;t help but find that noteworthy. Indeed, the block has not gone unquestioned; nor has it gone unsupported. While a number of administrators have commented on the thread, none of them have removed the block in spite of George&#39;s open offer. Why do you think that is? Is there some massive conspiracy of evil cabalists plotting behind the scenes? Is George speaking disingenuously or with implied threats? Could it be that no uninvolved admin happening upon this (fairly prominent) thread has thought that immediately removing the block would be the ideal course of action? Why wouldn&#39;t they believe that, do you think? I do agree that a number of editors support &#34;moving forward&#34;, but such a nod makes no mention of blocking or unblocking -- to me, it seems erroneous to suggest that editors have specifically commented on that matter when they have slyly avoided doing so. &#34;Moving forward&#34; could be taken to mean many things, here, and I&#39;ve a hunch that&#39;s intentional on the part of those saying it or trying to preempt one of those many meanings. – &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User:Luna Santin">&#60;font color=&#34;#28f&#34;&#62;Luna Santin&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 04:38, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I find George William Herbert&#39;s comment above disruptive. He&#39;s the blocking admin, so clearly involved, and yet he finds it appropriate to determine that the consensus is that the block should run its course?  That&#39;s not my reading of this discussion. I see a clear consensus that the point was made that Giano needs to be more civil and that lifting the block will be helpful in ending the disruption and showing good will. If George William Herbert (I almost called him George Herbert Walker) wants to set an example for civility, how about being responsive to and respectful of the opinions stated by other good faith editors and abiding by the community&#39;s consensus to lift the block.

<dd>You seem to be assuming I&#39;m trying to block an external uninvolved admin block review.  I&#39;m not doing that at all - any uninvolved admin can step up and formally review the block.  We&#39;re having an active discussion on the topic short of an independent block review.  I believe it&#39;s considered helpful if admins can participate in these when their actions are under review.  If I decide to change what I did as a result of a discussion it&#39;s a good thing, right?</dd>
<dd>If another admin wants to step up and formally review they can do that too...  So far, everyone&#39;s just giving input in the open consensus discussion, though.  That doesn&#39;t preclude anyone else from a block review, at any time.  <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Georgewilliamherbert">talk</a>) 03:44, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>We&#39;ve all reviewed it. It seems okay. Most of us now feel it&#39;s accomplished its purpose and have asked that you be so kind and courteous and generous in spirit as to lift it, especially per Durova&#39;s indication that she would have preferred avoiding a block to begin with and that she supports the extending of an olive branch in the form of lifting the block at this point. I say again that it takes a consensus of one to block, no matter how much opposition (although in this case the consensus seems to be that it was not a bad block even if it wasn&#39;t particularly helpful in limiting damage and disruption which is the stated purpose of block). Yet get a block reviewed or lifted takes a parting of the <a href="" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>. No wonder editors are so thankful for miraclulous actions of civility no matter how insignificant (thank you for the barnstars people) as we&#39;re left waiting for any crumb from all the big talkers about how important civility is. Where I come from actions speak louder than words. Durova&#39;s made an impressive display of goodwill despite some very bitey comments directed at her. I suggest you follow her example, and hope for the best.

<dd>As I said, my instinct at this point is that letting it run to expiration is the most healthy outcome.  That said, I understand your and Durova&#39;s point, and as I stated if it becomes clear to any admin that it&#39;s over / ok then an unblock is fine.  It&#39;s not clear to me yet, at this instant.</dd>
<dd>I would also support an unblock at time served if we get a consensus for it here, enough to outweigh the good block / good duration consensus in the section above.  So far we have less consensus here for that.  If it develops some time tonight and another admin calls it that way, I won&#39;t object in the morning.</dd>
<dd>I&#39;m going to be leaving for the night, and I&#39;ll leave it as is for now, but I invite any awake admins to consider the situation and discussion now and as it evolves later tonight, and do what you feel is right if you believe the situation changes.  I think that we&#39;ll all survive either way, the 24 hrs isn&#39;t that far out right now and Giano&#39;s going to have spent a large portion of that time hopefully getting a good night&#39;s sleep.  <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Georgewilliamherbert">talk</a>) 04:17, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>There comes a point when endless 24 hour blocks are no longer productive. At the moment, all these 24 hour blocks are merely punitive. They do nothing to calm the situation down; conversely, they stir up the situation. Nothing good is coming out of the blocks, and it just creates bitter feelings, irritated editors, and it&#39;s taking away the time to actually do what we all came to the project for. &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:X!">&#60;span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;&#62;X!&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;·&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:X!">&#60;span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>) &#38;nbsp;·&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="Swatch Internet Time">@202</a> &#38;nbsp;·&#38;nbsp;&#60;/small&#62; 03:50, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I actually think this was healthy - there&#39;s a strong consensus the block was justified, nobody did a reflexive unblock just because it was Giano, the discussion here has been much light and little heat or threat.  For a drama incident, everyone&#39;s responding pretty well.  Giano is clearly not happy - but also has not responded with either significant nasty comments nor very many comments in total.</dd>
<dd>It&#39;s clearly more drama than we would have seen with random user block - but also a healthy and relatively normal response given who it was.</dd>
<dd>I think we ultimately win if we have less drama and more consistent handling of incidents for everyone.  And I think we&#39;re seeing that here so far, and hopefully going forwards.  <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Georgewilliamherbert">talk</a>) 04:08, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>If you think the block has limited drama you are wearing rose tinted glasses or heavily inebriated. This long thread is testament, that polite discussion and mediation would have been far superior. Probably the best thing would have been to let the comments go for a while until everyone calmed down. But the civility police had to take action. Thank you for protecting us all.

<dd>This is the most calm and constructive incident with a Giano abuse complaint we&#39;ve had in 3 years, in my judgement.  The drama here has been verbose but not hostile, the discussion has been constructive, Giano has responded in a very minimal manner rather than confrontationally on his talk page.  I understand that you disagree with all of this, but where you see a small disaster, I see a responsible and adult and constructive response.  I apologize if my glass being half full at the moment offends your sensibility.  8-)  <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Georgewilliamherbert">talk</a>) 04:22, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>As I&#39;ve stated, I have no major issue with the block, though I certainly don&#39;t applaud it as some masterstroke of genius that has reduced drama (since the opposite appears to have happened). The issue now is at what point you can show some actual civility and good faith instead of continuing to beat a dead horse. Is there something to be accomplished by further humiliating a long term good faith editor? Ar eyou going to teach him a lesson?  Does it satisfy your ego? At what point will you be willing to let go?  Do you want him to apologize for saying something he thinks was important and needed to be said? It&#39;s not going to happen. What then?  Maybe you should extend the block. That will really do the trick. If only our admins were held to your high standards of civility. And maybe you folks could chip in now and then in the trenches where the content disputes happen instead of just playing good cop bad cop when a fight breaks out? You know, lead by example.

<dd>I hope you don&#39;t take this badly, but this thread took about another hour of my time after you made (among other things) the comment on my talk page about another incivility incident that someone should look at.  My efforts to go community police the thing you called in to report were delayed by this thread here.  Your interest in this thread is certainly useful and welcome, but the side effect of one long discussion is several short ones being deferred.  I have gone and left a warning in that case now, but it&#39;s useful to consider that admin time is a finite-sum game.  Simultaneously engaging in lengthy active discussion in one area and asking for productive proactive &#34;community policing&#34; in other areas doesn&#39;t work - we can&#39;t be everywhere at the same time, and if one large discussion occupies someone&#39;s available time they won&#39;t get to other things during the time when timely intervention is helpful.  I have been unable to go patrol several watchlisted hotspots today because of this stuff, including some where I&#39;ve been working to defuse stuff or warn problem editors.  Presumably anything that happened will wait until tomorrow.  And I&#39;m glad we&#39;re having an active constructive discussion about this block.  But time is not a renewable resource.  <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Georgewilliamherbert">talk</a>) 05:00, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>&#60; heh! Whilst it&#39;s kind of interesting to watch folk bashing an editor with an olive branch as he sleeps, I don&#39;t really think this whole situation can be described as &#39;calm and constructive&#39; (sorry!) - it seems pretty clear to me that Giano should be unblocked, and also that it&#39;s surprisingly easy for confirmation bias to kick in heavily, and for us all to be sat around praising the emporer&#39;s wonderful new wardrobe ;-) - This was a terrible decision on many levels, in my book, and I hope someone sane can sort it out soonish :-) <a href="" title="User:Privatemusings">Privatemusings</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Privatemusings">talk</a>) 04:44, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>I totally disagree with any unblock without allowing Giano the decency of dealing with this in his own way.

<dd>If Durova wants him unblocked, who are you to ignore her wishes. There is no personal attack if the &#39;person&#39; does not find it as such. Any reblock and I&#39;ll simply unblock. I&#39;m not big on personal attacks, however, I really don&#39;t give a shit what people say to me, and when others, especially those who are the &#39;victims&#39; of such an attack chime in, I believe they hold equal weight.

<dd>I was thinking the same thing as Spongefrog - that the user might have done this as a way to get someone else blocked. Another possibility is that the account is compromised and that someone else asked for it to be blocked - but if it&#39;s compromised, it should be blocked <i>anyway</i>. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs">carrots</a> 20:24, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>  True, and mainly because of that I disagree that this user should be blocked. They claim that it&#39;s because they are addicted to editing, and need to get away from Wikipedia. That&#39;s what the wikibreakEnforcer is for, not what admin&#39;s blocking abilities are for.&#60;br /&#62; If it is a compromised account, then they still have e-mail/talkpage if they manage to regain control of their account, otherwise they&#39;ll have to create a new user, which they would have had to do anyway - <a href="" title="User:Kingpin13">Kingpin</a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Kingpin13">13</a>&#60;/sup&#62; (<a href="" title="User talk:Kingpin13">talk</a>) 20:30, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Normally I agree with Tan - it could have been compromised.  However, the talkpage specifically says he&#39;s semi-retired from sometime ago.  At that point, we simply show him how to scramble his password, and leave him alone until he requests a password fix. (<a href="" title="User talk:Bwilkins">&#60;font style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps&#34;&#62;talk→&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid black;&#34;&#62;<b>&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Bwilkins">BWilkins</a>&#38;nbsp;</b>&#60;/span&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Bwilkins">&#60;font style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps&#34;&#62;←track&#60;/font&#62;</a>) 20:37, 17 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would be a good <i>nota bene</i> for future such requests. I don&#39;t see any harm with this one. Scrambling the password has essentially the same practical effect as an indef-block combined with not being able to edit his talk page. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs">carrots</a> 22:12, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li>Just a comment, but I doubt the account is compromised. Looking at the slightly broken English (no disrespect intended to Mbz1) from historical diffs and comparing the languge style to the above request and current talk page comments I am sure this editor is in control of their account. As to the block, well whilst there are other ways to stop editing, maybe we need to accept that sometimes editors will only &#34;accept&#34; a block as a route if they really do need to get away from WP (which is indicated here). I&#39;m no psychologist but even I can see that&#39;s pretty likely. I don&#39;t see any need to start having a go at Tan over his actions here which he has explained clearly. &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #0000ff;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Pedro">&#60;b&#62;Pedro&#60;/b&#62;</a> : <a href="" title="User_talk:Pedro">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#accC10;background:#0000fa;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;Chat&#38;nbsp;&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 21:32, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>I see no harm in giving them what they ask for, now that Tan has changed the autoblock setting. I&#39;d always wondered about the rationale behind the &#34;no self-requested blocks&#34; policy; if anything, blocking on request prevents the logical next step, which is continuous vandalism until blocked. Glad to see it was changed, I hadn&#39;t noticed that. --<a href="" title="User:Floquenbeam">Floquenbeam</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Floquenbeam">talk</a>) 22:40, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>I&#39;d advise you in future to portray a situation you bring here in a neutral fashion.

<dd>The discussion I re-closed was one of the many instances of trolling and quackery that shows up on that talk page. Frankly, I&#39;m surprised that a brand-new account&#39;s first few edits show such a startling familiarity with the admins, processes, and template syntax used on Wikipedia. In any event, while I do not believe re-closing the discussion in question was an error at all, Calmano apparently believes it was such a grievous one that the user&#39;s <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mailer_diablo&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302545120" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mailer_diablo&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302545120">5th edit</a> was to instruct <a href="" title="User:Mailer diablo">User:Mailer diablo</a> to ban me.

<dd>I collapsed it because it was obviously a returning editor, with a note showing great familiarity with the likely results of such trolling. The comment, and calmano&#39;s later, are of the &#39;I heard/read it <i>somewhere</i>, so it has to go in like I think I remember it or else that&#39;s proof there&#39;s a conspiracy&#39; sort. That&#39;s not sufficient for changing the article ,and it&#39;s often, as in this case, already covered in the article in sufficient, or summary, style.  The Obama article daily sees POV pushing from far right wing or racist editors upset that Obama&#39;s been elected, (illegally, they like to allege), or that he&#39;s black, or that a black man got illegally elected (this is usually the case). As such, collapsing these is the best solution, because it doesnt&#39; blank the troll, but shows it&#39;s been read and moved past.

<dd>Short answer: No, admins are approved by default. Long answer: I left this message on his talk page - <i>if this task has consensus, you should file a BRFA so the edits can be done with a bot flag, if this task doesn&#39;t have consensus...well, then you shouldn&#39;t be doing it! =)</i> He&#39;s not presently editing, so no immediate action is required, but I think a BRFA would be Stephen&#39;s best bet. –&#60;font face=&#34;verdana&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="user:xeno"><b>xeno</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34; face=&#34;verdana&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 16:36, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>&#34;From 11 April to 23 April 2008, a centralized discussion considered the appropriateness of using &#34;from-owner&#34; image placeholders on biographies of living persons. A carefully structured discussion clarified the objections to this practice as well as its benefits. There was significant opposition to the use of images such as Replace this image female and Replace this image male. 35 editors (66%) agreed with the question, &#34;placeholder images should not be used at all on the main page of articles&#34;, however, only 14 editors (45%) agreed with any particular recommendation&#34;.</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>On the one hand, I&#39;m a touch uncomfortable seeing AWB used for anything that even smells a smidge controversial. On the other hand, there seems to be consensus that these images shouldn&#39;t be used (I say that having supported their use, previously, mind you). It was a good experiment, but hasn&#39;t worked out as well as we hoped it might.

<dd>Personally I wouldn&#39;t have supported that as a solution, it uses a small line of text, and in that example is rather lost in the shuffle. I think the placeholders work because they are obvious and seen by all who look at the article.

<p>I think the above shows that there still is some discussion needed on this issue. So maybe we can consider the following as what to do next:
</p>
<ol>
<li>All editors are reminded not to remove those placeholders for now until community has decided that this is indeed consensus</li>
<li>A new RFC is opened to discuss the pros and cons of those images which is advertised to the wider community using a watchlist notice. The RFC should include the question whether removal of those images should be sought.</li>
<li>If (and only if) the RFC shows that there is indeed consensus for those removals, then a bot account will be requested to remove those images. </li></ol>
<p>This way, we can avoid cries of &#34;stop him, there is no consensus!&#34; and maybe settle the question once and for all. Even if said proposed RFC does result in &#34;no consensus&#34;, we will have a result that allows us to deal with such situations in the future. Talking about the issue itself here will not yield any productive results and Stephen seems to have stopped to allow discussion to take place, so there is no further need for ANI discussion.

<li>Hi, I am a <a href="" title="WP:OTRS">WP:OTRS</a> volunteer who occasionally works the photo submission queue. I can attest that these placeholders are <b>very successful at getting us free photographs.</b> We get on the order of several dozens of photograph submissions per week for articles that have such placeholders. That&#39;s why I consider it disruptive to remove all these images without consensus. I propose that a bot revert these removals and I agree that we should have a RfC on the question whether we want such placeholders and whether they should be automatically added to or removed from articles. &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Sandstein">&#60;font style=&#34;color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;&#34;&#62;<b>&#38;nbsp;Sandstein&#38;nbsp;</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 08:55, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>Anyways, Steven shouldn&#39;t be making mass rollbacks of already existing placeholders, it&#39;s true that there is enough consensus to stop using new ones, but I don&#39;t that think that there is enough to remove then <i>en masse</i>, since the <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests_for_approval/AmeliorationBot_2">BAG request to remove them</a> did not get enough consensus.

<dd>I&#39;d support it based on the fact that it would send a strong signal to every user not to make potentially controversial edits automated on a larger scale. If we just sit back and say &#34;oh well, now it has already happened&#34;, we invite people to do similar things because they will not have to worry to be reverted... On the other hand, that would be quite many edits to rollback and as such, potentially, an unneeded drain on our servers that might be re-reversed if a consensus is found to allow such removals. I think the best course of action will be to quickly establish any kind of preliminary consensus by asking for input at multiple venues at the same time.

<dd>Consensus is imho that no <i>new</i> ones should be added but that old ones should not be removed either. So this rollback-proposal would only restore the previous (consensus) status-quo.

<p>These images are ugly, disruptive and overwhelmingly unwanted, and I&#39;ve never seen <i>any</i> evidence that pages on which they&#39;re present have a notably better record of getting properly-licensed images added to them than articles that don&#39;t have these on them do. And the idea that they shouldn&#39;t be added to new articles, but should still be left <i>on</i> old articles to which they have <i>previously</i> been added, is hardly any sort of defined consensus — at best, it&#39;s a quirky, hairsplitting interpretation of the fact that there isn&#39;t a strong consensus for <i>either</i> using them or removing them. And the idea that a person can&#39;t use AWB to make an edit they&#39;d be perfectly within their right to make manually is also a non-starter — either these are always okay or they never are, no in between. If they are okay, then they should continue to be used on new articles — and if they&#39;re not okay, then they shouldn&#39;t be on old ones and it <i>doesn&#39;t matter</i> what tool an editor uses to remove them. <a href="" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Bearcat">talk</a>) 02:20, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>If I had seen those discussions I would said that placing placeholder images is a standard measure to make people want to replace them.

Dunno why people dislike them so much, but they seem to be effective in improving the encyclopedia, but the discussion already closed months ago.... How about we make a new RfC, but this time we ask the OTRS to make a measurement of the effectiviness of the placeholders, so we base our decision in real data and not in how ugly we find the placeholders to be, and we ask people if they would accept the placeholder if it simply looked cooler? --<a href="" title="User:Enric Naval">Enric Naval</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Enric Naval">talk</a>) 07:24, 21 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>I made a valid suggestion to the Barack Obama article.  His Illinois senate history is very sparse.  All other articles have a campaign section.  Obama&#39;s senate campaign was very controversial since he had all his opponents removed from the ballot.  This should be described in a brief and neutral way.  To refuse to have it is like refusing to have a section on his presidential campaign or refusing to mention the George W. Bush 2000 election controversy, an act of omission.</p>
<p>The point isn&#39;t debating inclusion in this board.  The point is that enforcement of the probation is necessary.</p>

<p>Iniclusion of the edit is not the point of this board.  The point is that removal of valid comments is worse than vandalism and vandalism results in block.  So ThuranX and GoodDamon should both be blocked for at least 48 hours and prohibited from making more trouble at the Obama board.  I am annoyed more at the process (or lack of process) rather than whether to add the proposed edit or not. <a href="#39.3Bm_an_insect" title="User:Chase me dinosaurs, I&amp;amp;">Chase me dinosaurs, I&#38;#39;m an insect</a> (<a href="#39.3Bm_an_insect" title="User talk:Chase me dinosaurs, I&amp;amp;">talk</a>) 19:21, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>The problem remains.  There is no civil discussion.  Those who did wrong are accusing me of popping up after a year.  (FYI, someone called me a sock last year, that other &#34;Chase me ladies&#34; user.  That soured my taste of Wikipedia so I kept reading but did not edit).  That shows that WP doesn&#39;t solve the problem but attacks the editor making the comment.  So incivility again.</p>
<p>The solution is that ALL editors editing Obama should know that the article is on probation so ALL must show their best behavior.  Collapsing comments and deleting comments and calling others socks worsens the problem.  That&#39;s why the article is bad.  Thugs chase away others.</p>
<p>So again, an administrator should uphold the article probation and stop all editors who are not at their best behaviour.  In this case, it ThuranX and GoodDamon have acted less than honourably...in fact, horribly.  Only when everyone is a diplomat, is ethical, and discusses will Obama article probation stand a chance.  </p>
<p>In fact, I am so fed up with this bullying that I am quitting WP for the time being.  Troublemakers, you have won.  I am quitting for now but reserve the right to edit.  <a href="#39.3Bm_an_insect" title="User:Chase me dinosaurs, I&amp;amp;">Chase me dinosaurs, I&#38;#39;m an insect</a> (<a href="#39.3Bm_an_insect" title="User talk:Chase me dinosaurs, I&amp;amp;">talk</a>) 23:28, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The Obama article has seen frequent disruptive behavior, enough so that part of the probation -- of which I&#39;m fully aware, thank you -- is the swift removal of trolling discussions. There is no requirement that editors have to discuss Obama&#39;s mafia-like influence over politics in Chicago, his foreign birth, his atheistic Muslim religion, his refusal to say the Pledge of Allegiance, his distaste for Mom and apple pie, his love of terrorists, his hatred of America, or the souls he obliterates with his laser eyes. In all seriousness, his time in the Senate is covered in detail in a <a href="" title="United States Senate career of Barack Obama">sub-article</a>, and the campaign itself is covered in <a href="" title="United States Senate election in Illinois, 2004">another one</a>. There&#39;s no point in duplicating existing articles in what&#39;s already a <a href="" title="WP:SUMMARY">summary style family of articles</a> that is absolutely enormous.

<dd>A quick review of the talkpage does not indicate whether any violation of the agreed civility parole will result in a return to the indef block, so I would suggest that an initial sanction of 1 week will suffice in emphasising that the community is not prepared to tolerate further violations.

At the same time, Norcalal has left comments, and Carlos has left me some messages in response to my requests for information.  In short: the IP is asking for Highspeed&#39;s user talk page to be unprotected, so that Highspeed can post an unblock request; Carlos has explained the protection as a drama-reduction attempt, because socks of <a href="" title="User:Biaswarrior">User:Biaswarrior</a> (which Carlos sees Highspeed to be) apparently misuse their talk pages after they&#39;re blocked.  I have some doubts about Highspeed&#39;s integrity (see his comments at <a href="" title="Template talk:Monterey County, California">Template talk:Monterey County, California</a>), partially due to <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Carlossuarez46&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=301521629" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Carlossuarez46&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=301521629">this</a> edit, although the IP explains this as a technical glitch.  Although Carlos has told me that &#34;I&#39;ll leave the decision to you&#34; on this situation, I&#39;m uncomfortable making these decisions myself.

<li>Like the Keystone cops or something around here. Are admins hellbent on getting me and then keeping me connected to this Highspeed? Why has no one looked at the entire interaction?...From the very beginning? You guys are way off base. I do not know this guy and if you can trump this up to connect me to him then just get it over with. I am sick of this drama. My issue with Carlos is two part and totally unrelated to Highspeed. What harm did my comments do at Highspeeds talk page? They are direct and state what I was experiencing related to the GNIS place name debate? Then the IP related to Highspeed came to my page to leave a statement-totally unsolicited by me. I then asked Nytend to clarify what was going on. Is there a witch hunt brewing? Prove that I have done something worthy of all the drama or let it go. This is unbelievable.  05:22, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>FROM MY POST at NYTENDS TALK PAGE: Carlos states: &#34;Here&#34; the two seem to be working together? Give me a break. This smells like witch hunt and is truly ridiculous, if it is. I am not going explain why I was interested in speedy deletion tags again and again. And that note from me on Highspeed&#39;s discussion page related to the GNIS is a valid point and nothing in that post is divorced from the truth of Carlos&#39; behavior or the concern in the community (beyond my own related to the GNIC stub article proliferation). NOTHING I have done can be connected to culpability no matter how hard any editor/admin may wish to try to connect it. Other editors or admins can decipher this mess all they want. But I am mindful of Goebbels (who worked for Hitler)--tell a lie (or misperception?) enough and the people (other editors and administrators) in this case may come around to believing it. What if this Highspeed guy did make a mistake with an editing tool? Just look at the mess he made in Carlos page. It makes no sense that he would do that blatantly unless he is nuts. POSSIBLY RELATED EXAMPLE: I had a problem with an article up in the northern forest a long while back (probably Yreka or therabouts in Northern California) and it looked to me like the editor was willfully vandalizing over and over. But guess what? He was suffering with a messed up keyboard and trying to work around it as best as he could. It wasn&#39;t satisfactory to me, but I could find no other reasonable explanation other than he was crazy. AND he apologized and it NEVER happened again.

<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Several misconceptions, Luna: (1) I didn&#39;t ban Highspeed, I blocked him; (2) as for whether there is a dispute with him, I had never had contact with him if (as he claims) he is not Biaswarrior until he rampaged on my talk page. As I explained on your talk: if this guy is Biaswarrior, it&#39;s a sock, gets a block no warnings are needed and given BW&#39;s prior drama on talk pages, enough is enough; given that you consider that there was some prior interaction between us, then you seem to accept that Highspeed is Biaswarrior (although you seem to have missed that Biasprotector was Biaswarrior earlier as reflected on your talk, but anyway - you seem to be as &#34;involved&#34; with Biaswarrior as I am) but having had prior interaction with socks doesn&#39;t disable an admin from blocking them - otherwise, socking would be more prolific than it is. Now, on the chance that Highspeed isn&#39;t Biaswarrior, the only interaction I had with this guy was the edits he made to my talk page including what seemed to be obvious vandalism which Highspeed denied on Nyttend&#39;s talk page even after confronted with the diff. Now, he claims it was a browser malfuction - I&#39;m not technical so although it seems odd and unlikely I cannot disprove it.  We&#39;ve seemed to have reached the <a href="" title="Godwin&#39;s Law">Godwin&#39;s Law</a> level in Norcalal&#39;s latest post above. Note: there hasn&#39;t been a single apology for what Highspeed did (he claims unintentionally). If you all think that Highspeed will not do what he&#39;s done before, of course you can unblock him, asking for mentorship seems to be a positive step. So would an apology. <a href="" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Carlossuarez46">talk</a>) 15:47, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

Even if that one unfortunate edit had been made with the most malicious of intent, the appropriate response would have been a warning. Given your lock on Highspeed&#39;s talk page, attempting to prevent the user from appealing your hasty block, I think describing it as an attempted ban is more appropriate. You&#39;ve repeatedly claimed that Highspeed is a sockpuppet of Biaswarrior, but so far the only supporting evidence I&#39;ve found from you is a vague mention of <a href="" title="WP:DUCK">WP:DUCK</a> -- please explain why you feel it&#39;s appropriate to immediately and indefinitely ban a longtime user with such a flimsy justification. If you&#39;re unable or unwilling to provide supporting evidence, it seems to me that <i>you</i> owe Highspeed an apology, and an unblock. – &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User:Luna Santin">&#60;font color=&#34;#28f&#34;&#62;Luna Santin&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 02:31, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<li>Judging from the available evidence here, on <a href="" title="User talk:Highspeed">User talk:Highspeed</a> and at <a href="#Highspeed" title="User talk:Carlossuarez46">User talk:Carlossuarez46</a>, I also tend to believe that this was a very ill-considered block, both on the merits and because it was made by an administrator who appears to have been in a conflict with the blocked user (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive552#User:Norcalal_.26_User:Highspeed" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive552#User:Norcalal_.26_User:Highspeed"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive552#User:Norcalal_.26_User:Highspeed" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive552#User:Norcalal_.26_User:Highspeed">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive552#User:Norcalal_.26_User:Highspeed</a></a>).

<dd>I agree with unblocking Highspeed, which I believe I&#39;ll go do presently, since Luna appears to agree as well.  I would rather chalk the block up to a misconception rather than any sort of malice on Charlossuarez46&#39;s part, and not worry about it so long as it doesn&#39;t happen again.

I warned him about misusing the edit summary &#39;rvv&#39; in cases where it is not actually vandalism, as that could be construed as uncivil, and he deleted my warning as &#39;<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nukes4Tots&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=301853806|" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nukes4Tots&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=301853806|">destalkerized. go away.</a>&#39; I wasn&#39;t sure if he understood the message I was trying to convey to him, since I used a generic template to send the first message, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Remington_51&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=301738452|" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Remington_51&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=301738452|">so I left this personalized message with another example of when not to use &#39;rvv&#39;</a> (the misused rvv this time was <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Remington_51&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=301738452|" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Remington_51&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=301738452|">here</a>.) he then reverted my message with the edit summary <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nukes4Tots&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=301899141|" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Nukes4Tots&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=301899141|">rvv</a>.

<dd>Another admin reviewed independently a few hours ago and passed on doing anything, but Theserialcomma just posted a malformed (probably won&#39;t show up on the unblock requests category properly) unblock request on his talk page <a href="" title="User talk:Theserialcomma">User talk:Theserialcomma</a>.  If another uninvolved admin can go take a look I&#39;d appreciate it.</dd>
<dd>Please note that contrary to TSC&#39;s claim in the unblock I am asserting no defense for Nukes4Tots actions here and not arguing for him to be unblocked.  Theserialcomma caused a very large number of ANI threads over the last few months, though they were usually the victim in terms of direct abuse.  This evolved into a situation where they pestered someone they knew did not want to talk to them at all, replaced a warning on their talk page after it was removed once.  If this was the first time, AGF would presume this was neither intentional nor malicious.  This is far, <i>far</i> from the first time.  Even if it was still unintentional and innocent, the quantity of incidents rises to disruptive, and I can no longer AGF on the matter.  There have been too many - a user who genuinely understands that getting along with the community is important would have stopped poking the stick in months ago.</dd>
<dd>The current <a class="externallink" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility/Poll#Is_baiting_underrecognised.3F" rel="nofollow" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility/Poll#Is_baiting_underrecognised.3F">civility poll</a> section on baiting supports a community consensus that baiting is a problem and has been under-recognized in abuse cases.</dd>
<dd>I do invite review, but I am hopeful that we can start to set the precedent that if you appear on ANI too often even as the victim, there&#39;s probably something you&#39;re doing very wrong, and that you should expect to be held responsible for that.  <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Georgewilliamherbert">talk</a>) 03:48, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>I have procedurally declined the unblock request pending resolution of this review. I am <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility/Poll#No_.28baiting.29" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Civility/Poll#No_.28baiting.29">on record</a> saying that &#34;baiting&#34; is not a useful description of blockable misconduct. Still, Georgewilliamherbert, could you please provide the diffs of the edits that you believe constitute the misconduct that triggered your block, and could you explain why you chose a block length of <i>one month</i> for an editor who had not previously been blocked? &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Sandstein">&#60;font style=&#34;color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;&#34;&#62;<b>&#38;nbsp;Sandstein&#38;nbsp;</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 07:30, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>A month does seem a <i>tad</i> excessive given the previously-unpopulated block log and lack of warnings. →&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#465945;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>ROUX</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#465945;&#34;&#62;<b>₪</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;small&#62;&#38;nbsp;07:55, 16 July 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;
<ul>
<li>I will follow up with diffs, but the proximate cause was the pair of warnings about misuse of &#34;rvv&#34; as a revert summary for nonvandalism.  As I indicated to Theserialcomma on his talk page, he has been engaged in enough conflict with Nukes4Tots that he should not have been leaving warnings there - Nukes had repeatedly told him to leave him alone and not post on his talk page.  TSC had a point about &#34;rvv&#34; - but should have sought an uninvolved user or admin to talk to Nukes about it.  TSC knew or reasonably should have been expected to have known that any criticism he leveled on Nukes would be taken badly by now and would likely result in rude behavior.  Even if we assume that the first warning was in innocent ignorance of that, putting it back after Nukes deleted it is either malign baiting or operating in sufficient ignorance of the effects of ones actions upon others that it rises to the level of negligence and disruption.  The next response was to come to ANI.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<dd>One can assume good faith about malign intent in this - I don&#39;t anymore, but I can see how others might - but any reasonable person who had been in such conflict with another editor would know that acting in that manner would be provocative.  The 1-2-ANI sequence was telling.</dd>
<dd>I do not factually know what TSC intended by this - but what he did was clearly poking a stick repeatedly at an editor he had been in conflict with multiple times over multiple months.  If he was malignly baiting, then he should go.  If he really didn&#39;t realize that this was provocative, that he was poking a stick in, then there is a serious lack of judgement regarding interpersonal communications, serious enough that it rises to the level of disruption.</dd>
<dd>The number of times he&#39;s come to ANI indicates the scope of the issue.  I&#39;ll need to dig up the diffs.  Those provided the background - this would not be a necessary or appropriate response to a first incident which could be characterized as baiting.</dd>
<dd>Regarding block length - I submit that if one is baiting, one should be held as responsible as the effects were upon the baitee.  Nukes was blocked for a month.</dd>
<dd>If there&#39;s widescale disagreement with proportional responsibility (half or more of admins responding here disagree) then I agree in advance with any admin reducing that to two weeks or one week.  I would like to see some healthy discussion on it first, though.</dd>
<dd>I don&#39;t intend to argue that Nukes4Tots has any lack of responsibility here - a number of admins have stated that they feel that WPMILHIST / WPGUNS editors have been acting insular and hostile, with Nukes being one of the two main culprits blamed.  There is no support in the poll on civility for allowing baited people to get away with having responded aggressively in an uncivil manner.  But there is clear support that baiting is not ok, and that it&#39;s been under-responded-to.  <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Georgewilliamherbert">talk</a>) 19:40, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li>I think we got TSC&#39;s attention but a month is way too long, even a week is excessive for a first block. More punitive then preventative. I&#39;d suggest commuting this to time served or 24 hours. If there is a repetition then something longer can be imposed. <a href="" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Spartaz">Humbug!</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 21:30, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t consider Theserialcomma to be as innocent as he claims to be. His decision to continuously converse with Nukes4Tots, despite the fact that Nukes4Tots no longer wishes to communicate with this user (to elaborate, Theserialcomma was the one who initiated the SPI reports on Nukes4Tots and created the AN/I notices on Nukes&#39; behavior), gives off an impression of baiting. Although this is a serious issue, this is only the first block for this user, so a month might seem punitive. I support the block being reduced to a few days or a week at most. &#60;span style=&#34;background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Nishkid64">Nishkid64</a> &#60;/span&#62;&#60;sub&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Nishkid64">Make articles, not wikidrama</a>)&#60;/sub&#62; 21:56, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>I&#39;d like to point out that TSC has a reputation of getting into disagreements with others, then making himself to appear like the innocent one in the situation, when he&#39;s not always completely innocent (such as the case here). Just from my observations of him. He previously initiated an SPI on another long term, good faith editor, <a href="" title="User:Tothwolf">User:Tothwolf</a>. When that was closed (Tothwolf was not socking), TSC took Tothwolf to COI/N over a separate issue. This has happened to many people that TSC has run into on Wikipedia. Its a wonder people stick around with such harassment. <a href="" title="User:Killiondude">Killiondude</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Killiondude">talk</a>) 00:03, 17 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Having been in dispute with TSC because of his behavior towards Tothwolf (which is practically hounding), I agree with Killiondude. As it is some admins stand ready to block TSC if he starts hounding Tothwolf again, but any attempt to talk to TSC about the discussion is railroaded by accusations of <a href="" title="WP:IRC">IRC cabalism</a> from him. I would suggest that any unblock be given a conditional that he honor Nukes4Tots&#39; request to not contact him. I do agree, however, that a month&#39;s block for the first <b>block</b> is to excessive, but am against under a week because of his harassment. -&#60;font color=&#34;32CD32&#34;&#62;<i><a href="" title="User:Jéské Couriano">Jeremy</a></i>&#60;/font&#62; &#60;font color=&#34;4682B4&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Jéské Couriano">v^_^v</a> <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Jéské Couriano">Tear him for his bad verses!</a>)&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62; 01:52, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Time served, in my opinion. It&#39;s the first one.

<p>Based on the above discussion, there&#39;s clear consensus to reduce to no more than a week, and credible argument for time served.

<dd>Really, George, as the blocking admin, you should do what <i>you</i> feel is right. Don&#39;t worry about making the greatest number of editors happy; do what&#39;s right for the project. Are you <i>preventing</i> further disruption? What is <i>your</i> feeling on this baiting reoccurring after the block is lifted or expired? Whether it&#39;s a day or a month is really dependent on your judgment here. Consider our opinions, make a decision, state it, and stand by it. I know I&#39;m not telling you anything you don&#39;t already know, but I can&#39;t help feeling that you are selling out your own judgment. <a href="" title="User:Tanthalas39">&#60;font color=&#34;#CC7722&#34; face=&#34;Papyrus&#34;&#62;<b>Tan</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>  &#38;#124;  <a href="" title="User talk:Tanthalas39">&#60;font color=&#34;#21421E&#34; face=&#34;Papyrus&#34;&#62;39&#60;/font&#62;</a> 05:36, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>My judgement is and always has been that my judgement can at times be mistaken.  One of the benefits of a functional diverse community is that if you listen, errors and misjudgements can be corrected, making everyone&#39;s interactions better.  Academic communities, engineering work peer review and cross checks and signoffs, aviation and spaceflight crew resources management all suggest that being willing to accept constructive criticism and improve ones own work is far less likely to develop critical errors.  I try to balance between decisiveness (necessary to perform any sort of enforcement effectively) and openness to feedback (necessary to avoid further propogation of decisive failures).</dd>
<dd>What I have seen is that there&#39;s agreement with the substance of the block but disagreement about the length.  We have essentially no precedent here, we haven&#39;t done much baiting situation enforcement to date - I had an idea for how to approach it and did so, and people are concerned that it&#39;s overly harsh.  That&#39;s good feedback.  <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">Georgewilliamherbert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Georgewilliamherbert">talk</a>) 18:39, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>On the gripping hand - TSC has just on his talk page claimed that if he&#39;s not unblocked earlier, he will wait for the block to expire, create a new account to avoid the stigma of this one, and &#34;continue acting exactly as I have been&#34;.  <a class="externallink" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Theserialcomma&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302633359" rel="nofollow" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Theserialcomma&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302633359"><a class="externallink" href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Theserialcomma&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302633359" rel="nofollow" title="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Theserialcomma&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302633359">https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Theserialcomma&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302633359</a></a>.</dd>
<dd>I do not think he believes that anyone else supports my conclusion that he was baiting.  This is despite several other users and admins having shown up there and politely said so, and the thread above.</dd>
<dd>Could other uninvolved admins perhaps let him know on <a href="" title="User talk:Theserialcomma">User talk:Theserialcomma</a> that what he&#39;s proposing is not acceptable behavior?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Problematic_edit_and_subsequent_comments_by_User:Kasaalan">Problematic edit and subsequent comments by User:Kasaalan</span></h2>

<p>A content dispute has been going on recently about some pro-Israel organizations in the United States. One of the editors in the dispute contacted me asking for my involvement, and while I replied to the question, will of course not get involved or take a side in the content dispute. However, because most will probably consider me an involved administrator anyway, I&#39;m taking this here. Basically one of the editors in the dispute, <a href="" title="User:Kasaalan">User:Kasaalan</a>, has made <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Washington_Report_on_Middle_East_Affairs&#38;diff=302300134&#38;oldid=302299128" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Washington_Report_on_Middle_East_Affairs&#38;diff=302300134&#38;oldid=302299128">this edit</a>, which separates Jewish criticism of the organization from non-Jewish criticism of it. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Washington_Report_on_Middle_East_Affairs&#38;oldid=302300134#Criticism" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Washington_Report_on_Middle_East_Affairs&#38;oldid=302300134#Criticism">Here</a> is a permanent link.</p>
<p>I have contacted Kasaalan over this obviously problematic edit (again, I don&#39;t care about the underlying content issue and strongly urge admins in this ANI to ignore it, and leave it for content RfC or something), and what&#39;s really concerning is that he defended making a separate section for Jewish criticism, in a way that clearly misses the point and <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKasaalan&#38;diff=302391115&#38;oldid=302390528" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AKasaalan&#38;diff=302391115&#38;oldid=302390528">confusing pro-Israel groups with Jews in general</a>.

<dd>I don&#39;t like to confuse all Jew with pro-Israel lobby or anything, however I can&#39;t use a title as pro-Israel for <a href="" title="Jewish Virtual Library">Jewish Virtual Library</a> unless there is RS saying so. I tried to use a more broad title, since &#34;Criticism by Jewish and pro-Israel parties&#34; got deleted, I didn&#39;t understand you before however do you now claim &#34;Criticism by Jewish parties&#34; is being offensive. If so you may just offer a general and less offending title, however a categorisation is needed since all parties has conflict of interest to the case, and accusing the involved party as Nazi, anti-semitic or such.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>Do you specifically offended by &#34;Criticism by Jewish and pro-Israel parties&#34;, &#34;Criticism by Jewish parties&#34; or by both.</dd>
<dd>The original title I added was &#34;Criticism by Jewish and pro-Israel parties&#34; now it is &#34;Criticism by Jewish parties&#34; to include as more general and less POV, however the title may change per discussion and if any more neutral title is offered I certainly use it, however except 1 source [<i><a href="" title="National Post">National Post</a> (note: <a href="#Criticism" title="National_Post">National_Post</a> which is criticised for being anti-muslim etc. yet by a Conflict of Interest party <a href="" title="Canadian Islamic Congress">Canadian Islamic Congress</a> so not sure if criticism is accurate)</i>] all criticism in the article is by Jewish or pro-Israel lobby or media watchdog organizations, Some organisations are clearly WP:POV such as <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_Accuracy_in_Middle_East_Reporting_in_America#CAMERA_Israeli_lobby_campaign_in_Wikipedia," rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_Accuracy_in_Middle_East_Reporting_in_America#CAMERA_Israeli_lobby_campaign_in_Wikipedia,">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_for_Accuracy_in_Middle_East_Reporting_in_America#CAMERA_Israeli_lobby_campaign_in_Wikipedia,</a> some self-statedly &#34;defenders of Israel&#34;.

<dd>Personally I support using <i>Criticism by Jewish and pro-Israel parties</i> if no better title is offered</dd>
<dd><i>Criticism by pro-Israel parties</i> might not be accurate</dd>
<dd><i>Criticism by Jewish parties</i> general (not sure it is any way offended, however if it is offended to you instead removal can you offer a better and more NPOV title)</dd></dl>
<p>The issue is the criticism section in the article is only limited to <a href="" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> parties so a note or title is needed somehow. <a href="" title="User:Kasaalan">Kasaalan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kasaalan">talk</a>) 11:00, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>Do you get offended by &#34;criticism by jewish parties&#34; title, if so offer a general, better and more NPOV title, however since all the parties and Jewish and their criticism is being <a href="" title="anti-Israel">anti-Israel</a> or <a href="" title="antisemitic">antisemitic</a>, they have a conflict of interest to the case per ethnically and religiously one way or another. We are offering a vast criticism section which consumes more than half of the article, and the organisations origin should be noted one way or another. I tried to generelize the title, if anyone offers a better one we can use it. You should use discussion page, ask a RFC or 3rd party view before ANI anyway. <a href="" title="User:Kasaalan">Kasaalan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kasaalan">talk</a>) 11:14, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Kasaalan continues to begin everything that is remotely Jewish/Israel with Pro-Israel, Pro-Jewish, Pro-Jewistan, Pro-Jewniverse, pro-Jew World Order...etc..etc..etc. Then he even created a criticism section that said, &#34;Criticisms by &#60;s&#62;Pro-&#60;/s&#62;Jewish and pro-Israel organizations.&#34; I provided more thorough responses in talk which obviously didn&#39;t phase the user. I don&#39;t really care about punishment I just want some moderation or an uninvolved party to tell me what to do before this becomes a hate crime.

<dd>Possibly you didn&#39;t know what canvas is as an inexperienced editor, so possibly there is not much reason for you to be worried about getting punished. You called me some names, yet I don&#39;t care about that either personally. Main purpose is finding a solution for the case. Yet more editor comments are required for finding a proper solution.</dd>
<dd>I tagged the <i>&#34;Criticism by Jewish community&#34;</i> as a general title with &#60;nowiki&#62; &#60;/nowiki&#62; tag until a consensus reached.</dd>
<dd>The case is all the critical parties in the article belongs to Jewish community and has conflict of interest to the case, some of the are completely unreliable source, morever they harshly accuses the party as <a href="" title="anti-Semitic">anti-Semitic</a> <a href="" title="anti-Israel">anti-Israel</a> acting like <a href="" title="Nazi">Nazi</a> etc. So one way or another I am in favor of keeping criticism, yet with proper notes about political stances of the sources. As I do in other articles.</dd>
<dd>What is remotely Jewish Israel I referred as pro Israel. <a href="" title="Anti Defamation League">Anti Defamation League</a> is pro Israel per foundation statements. <a href="" title="Honest Reporting">Honest Reporting</a> and <a href="" title="Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America">Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America</a> are pro-Israel media watchdogs. If you have any objections try requesting a RFC, 3rd review or Arbitrary Process, I created titles under project Israel, Palestine and Israel-Palestine contribution pages. If more people comments we may find a solution.

<dd>Which wiki article I used pro-jewish term I asked. I commented over your edits as such with evidence and upon your actions. You rarely edit judaism topics, however when you do you try to substract information like removing &#34;Jew&#34; from a Jew person as &#34;anti-defamatory&#34; action. I had discussed your edits vastly in Adminship review with evidence. If you like we may create another topic about your edits.

<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Topic ban proposal</b> On reading this thread and the attempts by various editors including GWH here and elsewhere to have Kasaalan refrain from his disruptive style of editing I am left with the overwhelming impression that Kasaalan is unwilling or unable to stop at this time. &#60;u&#62;I propose that a topic ban for 3 months be placed on Kasaalan which would require that he not edit with regards any article, talk page, topic or thread that is related to Jews and Judaism.&#60;/u&#62;  This will allow him time to adjust his style and perhaps gain a wider set of interests - whilst at the same time reducing the disruption he is currently causing.  Would other administrators please comment, support or object below.  If I see a clear consensus over the next 24 hours I will be happy to instigate or alternatively another administrator might want to take such action in my stead.--<a href="" title="User:VirtualSteve">&#60;strong&#62;VS&#60;/strong&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 01:19, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd><b>Not an admin but just a quick comment</b> As the principal party involved, I would like to say a few things. First, I really don&#39;t want to be a part of any topic-ban or a wikipedia trial. I&#39;ve found them to be extremely depressing and often times users will seek retribution when their time runs out. Second, I can honestly say Kasaalan has potential to be a productive editor as far as Israel/Palestine is concerned, but obviously there are so major issues that is holding him back. I believe that topic bans rarely help editors overcome their behaviors but instead teach them to be more subtle with POV-pushing/attacks/whatever. I see Kasaalan has no block history so I&#39;m not sure if a topic-ban without priors is <a href="" title="kosher">kosher</a>. Don&#39;t consider my POV too much, I have a much more &#34;recognized&#34; history than Kasaalan. :D <a href="" title="User:Wikifan12345">Wikifan12345</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wikifan12345">talk</a>) 01:37, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your comment - the alternate then (in terms of prevention which is the primary reason for any action of this type) is to provide a short block to cease his disruptive editing.--<a href="" title="User:VirtualSteve">&#60;strong&#62;VS&#60;/strong&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 01:46, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I&#39;d support a topic ban, if only to see what Kasalaan would do if unable to edit I-P articles for a period of time.  I saw him from his start at <a href="" title="Rachel Corrie">Rachel Corrie</a>, which grew so tendentious that I disengaged from the article entirely.  I&#39;d suggest one month, though.  Really, a look through these diffs shows that Kasalaan hasn&#39;t learned anything from experience, except he knows policies a bit better than he did, for use only when arguing on talk pages.

<dd>Well it is hard to describe without using a term. Some of the users are citizen of Israel, some are racially Jewish some others religiously. However the term depends the context. Depending the context pro-Jewish may mean pro-Jewish (conservatist) or pro-Israel (right wing). I try to find an objective term as Israel-Jewish related editors, which refers conflict of interest to the case. For example I strictly stay away the topics which I feel I may have conflict of interest per (racially or per country based) and strictly not making edits in such topics. (I also don&#39;t do such edits without academical or reliable knowledge about that conflicts anyway) Yet some editors (tough they have clearly conflict of interest per racially or religiously) do not stay away from such titles, they do not state their origin or possible bias, yet accuse others as anti-... When being accused as anti then I have to define a pro-.... which is what happens in reality. I asked a question about possible conflict of origins about the issue. If every accusing editor can state their stance, it will be easier to understand what I mean.</dd>
<dd>Also it is same for <a href="" title="Sarah Palin">Sarah Palin</a> or <a href="" title="Scientology">Scientology</a>, religious or political conflict of interest is not much helpful if not previously stated for titles as such. <a href="" title="User:Kasaalan">Kasaalan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kasaalan">talk</a>) 10:30, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>i, too, know kasaalan from rachel corrie.  i actually agree with wikifan (gasp!) that he shouldn&#39;t be topic banned, and for some of the same reasons.  i think if he were given a mentor to work with, explaining the problems caused by his hyper-bolding and trouble with the subtleties of the english language, he could be an excellent contributor.  <a href="" title="User:untwirl">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;untwirl&#60;/font&#62;</a>(<a href="#Top" title="User talk:Untwirl">talk</a>) 02:30, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Certainly, editors, and not just those in conflict with Kasalaan, have taken time to explain the difficulties his edits cause.  I&#39;m not sure a mentor would have better luck.

<li>The issue is I add text per research and long readings. Some other editors object articles per personal opinions and even without bothering to the references fully. In no other article there are week long discussions over addition of a critical <a href="" title="Human Rights Watch">Human Rights Watch</a> report except <a href="" title="Rachel Corrie">Rachel Corrie</a> or I-P related articles. There is certain bias exist against addition of criticism and per removal of certain criticism and it is not caused by me. You referred <a href="" title="Rachel Corrie">Rachel Corrie</a> please show any disruptive or inaccurate parts in the article. <i>Show any case people tried to add criticism to balance and I objected (I only object content removal most of the time)</i> I personally found and add various reliable sources missing to improve the article which is near a featured article quality. <a href="" title="User:Kasaalan">Kasaalan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kasaalan">talk</a>) 03:01, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>


<ul>
<li>Clarification of the terms
<ul>
<li>Time to time I use pro-Israel and pro-Jewish term which refers to pro-Israel(right wing conservatives) and pro-Jewish(religiously or racially conservatives)
<ul>
<li>The editors I used the term practices editing in favor of their religious or political stance to the Palestine-Israel conflict and Judaism practice (as a conservative) which includes objecting addition of clear Reliable Sources with no good reason or trying to substract info that they don&#39;t like from wikipedia.</li>
<li>I can easily proof what the Israel and IDF supporting editors has unease about</li>
<li>Addition of details over Westernern casualties and killings in the Israel-Palestine areas (which heavily committed by Israel army)</li>
<li>And Recently</li>
<li>Addition of criticism to the POV sources like <a href="" title="Middle East">Middle East</a> Quarterly which advertised as <a href="" title="peer reviewed">peer reviewed</a> before I made some effort to add criticism</li>
<li>And addition of detail for conflict of interested (some heavily unreliable) critical parties for <a href="" title="WRMEA">WRMEA</a></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>


<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>In the same manner I might be called pro-Jewish</b> by means of pro-Israel (per peace camp) pro-Jewish (left or culturally mostly music which is an interest area of mine) or pro-Palestine (cultural as in manners of human rights) or even anti-Israel(per army human rights violations against Jews and Palestine population)
<ul>
<li>So the hate some editors refer do not refer to the Jews itself, however telling some POV source is POV is not POV in the first place</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>


<ul>
<li>Before making any more false accusations
<ul>
<li>I have no racial, religious personal COI to the Palestine-Israel conflict personally
<ul>
<li>(if you count as possible bias I have Jewish relatives (not blood related), friends of my family like I do Arab friends of my family - though except music I do not have much knowledge about Judaism religious practice or culture, I have a bit much about Muslim religious practice, culture and history yet that is again not vast)</li>
<li>I am not a supporter of Hamas, Islamic Jihad or current Palestine government, like I am no supporter of current Israel government or Israel army (actually I am not supporter of government in my home country anyway like most other countries in the world)</li>
<li>However if you ask my opinion about the Palestine-Israel issue I can clearly criticize
<ul>
<li>Both Israel army and most of Palestine armed wing groups commits serious Human Rights violations in the area against civillians
<ul>
<li>While Israel army kills and wounds multiple times more people since it has more army resources, finance support and followers (numbers doesn&#39;t lie)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>


<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><b>Can all the accuser parties first clearly state, if they have any religiously, racially or any other Conflict of Interests for Judaism, Israel or Israel Defense Forces publicly.</b></li></ul></li></ul>


<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li>Also can anyone put examples of my recent edits, which substracts any (accurate) information (I rarely remove any info even it isn&#39;t properly sourced I most tag it) to make a POV standpoint.</li></ul></li></ul>

<dd>Issues with POV sources also raised in discussion page by other parties. You skipped the discussion page and asked YnHockey&#39;s talk page help which is resulted in a swift and improper ANI. <a href="" title="User:Kasaalan">Kasaalan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kasaalan">talk</a>) 11:02, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Comment">Comment</span></h3>
<p>This discussion should be brought to a close. The immediate ANI issue has been resolved by removing the sub header in the criticism section of <a href="" title="WRMEA">WRMEA</a>. It is surely a waste of everyone&#39;s time to drag up previous disputes. If a <a href="" title="WP:RFC/U">WP:RFC/U</a> is warranted for <a href="" title="User:Kasaalan">Kasaalan</a>, then do that, and allow appropriate remedies/sanctions to come out of that. A topic ban proposal suddenly popping up here, on such a political topic (with such polarised views), is quite worrying, especially when this ANI section starts with a dispute about a single subheader that had a perfectly legitimate intent (identifying the political views of some organisations critical of WRMEA). A topic ban is a sledgehammer, and it should not be wielded lightly. <a href="" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:rd232">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 09:08, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Yes I think you make a valid point rd232 - however the dispute escalates it seems as a result of Kasaalan performing what many here and others at his talk page describe as disruptive edits.  Clearly a topic ban is within the realms of possible discussion at AN/I even in the middle of another dispute, and if that is what is required to stop this type of behaviour then there is nothing wrong with suggesting it - but that said I am not adverse to accepting your submission that this thread is not quite enough to pursue that outcome at this time.  I am more than happy to have the discussion closed (assuming others agree) however Kasaalan should understand that he is on notice by many editors in terms of the type of disruptive editing that he performs and is constantly being alerted to.  If that means that a new discussion is better aimed for the future (if necessary) either here or at RFC/U then that is an outcome that is quite within my realms of acceptance.--<a href="" title="User:VirtualSteve">&#60;strong&#62;VS&#60;/strong&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 09:46, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I would hope that he at least renounces recognized behavioral issues or else he&#39;ll just continue on. He just continues to rationalize his edits. <a href="" title="User:Wikifan12345">Wikifan12345</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wikifan12345">talk</a>) 10:21, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yes another fair point Wikifan2345 - I would be interested in seeing Kasaalan&#39;s response to your request that he recognises that his editing style is disruptive - without further rationalisation as to it being everyone else&#39;s fault.  I think you will agree with me that a straight yes or no (that is without another verbose essay style comment) will be best and certainly adequate for us to consider placing some additional assumption of good faith at his doorstep.

<dd>He called me &#34;manically obsessive&#34; many times for my edits, called another fellow editor&#39;s help previous to ANI. It is nice that he acts calm.</dd>
<dd>My reply is providing both parties edit&#39;s instead opinion pieces.</dd>
<dd>The links clearly show My edits are definitely improving, progressive and per RS.</dd>
<dd>It is clear, after I edited the article it is improved.</dd>
<dd>I took various steps for proving proof in discussion page, calling other related editor&#39;s review within Project Israel, Project Palestine, and Project Israel-Palestine Collaboration per I replied above.</dd>
<dd>Also I am still waiting an answer about accusing parties&#39; possible religious, racial or citizenship based conflict of interests about the Palestine-Israel issues, which none bothered to answer yet. <a href="" title="User:Kasaalan">Kasaalan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kasaalan">talk</a>)

<p>(outdent) I agree with Rd232. Those who have a problem with Kasalaan&#39;s editing should open an <a href="" title="WP:RfC/U">WP:RfC/U</a>. Light banter implying he&#39;s an anti-Semite on ANI is inappropriate and the insults from his detractors impugning his psychology are personal attacks.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Improper_block_by_Georgewilliamherbert">Improper block by Georgewilliamherbert</span></h2>

<p>I received a 24 hour block for &#34;edit warring&#34; at <a href="" title="Views of Lyndon LaRouche">Views of Lyndon LaRouche</a> by <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">User:Georgewilliamherbert</a>. The article in question had seen 11 reverts spread evenly over a 17 day period, 5 by Will Beback, 4 by myself, and 2 by another editor. The 3RR threshold was never approached by anyone. As edit wars go, this didn&#39;t even rank as a skirmish. The negotiations on the talk page are presently succeeding. In my opinion, no admin intervention was necessary, but if such an intervention <i>were</i> necessary, Will should have been blocked as well, since it takes two (or three) to tango. Therefore, I believe that GWH&#39;s block was improper, and I would like to have it expunged and my clean record restored. </p>
<p>In this dispute, I simply maintained that a large-scale and contentious re-write of a stable section, involving several possible violations of BLP, should not proceed until all issues were resolved on the talk page. The LaRouche articles have gone through a period of relative peace and quiet, and I think that all editors would do well to be circumspect about initiating any fresh round of POV warfare.</p>
<p>Now to a more serious matter. I received a warning on my talk page<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leatherstocking&#38;diff=302342384&#38;oldid=276454056" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leatherstocking&#38;diff=302342384&#38;oldid=276454056"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leatherstocking&#38;diff=302342384&#38;oldid=276454056" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leatherstocking&#38;diff=302342384&#38;oldid=276454056">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Leatherstocking&#38;diff=302342384&#38;oldid=276454056</a></a> from GWH, advising me that I was in violation of the various LaRouche-related arbcom decisions. With all due respect, this is utter hogwash. I began editing Wikipedia two years ago. After a while I began to observe the POV battles at the LaRouche articles without participating, other than to leave an occasional comment on a talk page. I never touched a LaRouche article until October of last year, and my occasional edits since then have never involved adding material, either positive or negative, about LaRouche or his group. I have edited only when I observed violations of policy, and my edits have been limited to reverts or to posting policy tags. GeorgeWilliamHerbert&#39;s threat to me is incorrect, inappropriate and should be withdrawn. --<a href="" title="User:Leatherstocking">Leatherstocking</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Leatherstocking">talk</a>) 15:28, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>All LaRouche articles are under a long list of mediation and arbitration restrictions as long as my arm.  These are clearly visible on every talk page related to LaRouche.  Editors must take caution.  Also, 3RR is not a liscence to revert three times per day.  You may be blocked for edit warring on any article at any time if your editing shows a willingness to use reverting as a method of forcing others to accept your personal view of how the article should read, regardless of how often you do it.  The compelling reason for an edit war block is the appearance of using the revert function to stifle others contributions.  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="WP:NODRAMA">&#60;small&#62;say <b>no</b> to drama&#60;/small&#62;</a> 16:48, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Leatherstocking had been actively participating in discussions with Will on the talk page, but had also taken to simply reverting saying &#34;No consensus for that&#34;.  It appeared that he&#39;d crossed the line into sterile reverting rather than good faith discussions at the time I blocked him.</dd>
<dd>We have the long, long problem history with this topic; that very article was full protected for much of the last two years.</dd>
<dd>Leatherstocking&#39;s edits appeared to be pro-LaRouche; he appeared to have escalated to sterile reverting; the articles still have special attention due to ongoing efforts to insert POV.</dd>
<dd>Will Beback has been attempting to work with everyone to build the best, NPOV and not whitewashed article we can there.  I&#39;ve tried to stay well back out of the content issues so that he can be the admin working content and I can be the admin working enforcement when socks show up and try to abuse things, to avoid either of us having a COI over content / enforcement issues.</dd>
<dd>Leatherstocking - If you really have no pro-LaRouche agenda, everything you gained by those reverts would be gained equally well by long term talk page discussions.  Will is extremely ethical and determined to do the right thing there.  Please take the step back and talk to him more determinedly.  He knows all about BLP and NPOV.  He&#39;s one of our admins - with many many years experience.  Work with him more collaboratively and there&#39;s no problem going forwards.</dd>

<dd>George, I think that you might want to take a closer look at the talk page (particularly before you block someone.) I have been fully engaged in the talk page negotiations. As I mention at the beginning of this post, I simply maintained that a large-scale and contentious re-write of a stable section, involving several possible violations of BLP, should not be posted to the article until all issues were resolved on the talk page. Will was repeatedly and aggressively pushing to post his new version of the section (he also wrote the old version of the section) while three other editors still had serious, unresolved objections. I had not &#34;escalated to sterile reverting,&#34; nor was I trying to &#34;insert POV&#34; -- I was negotiating to restrain the insertion of POV. The block of me was premature and incorrect, and I am asking here to have it reversed and my clean record restored.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Now, in response to Jayron32, the arbitration committee rulings are really quite simple. Aside from user-specific remedies, it boils down to this:</dd>
<dd>1. Don&#39;t use LaRouche publications as source material other than in LaRouche articles (LaRouche 1)</dd>
<dd>2. Don&#39;t use Wikipedia to promote LaRouche (LaRouche 1)</dd>
<dd>3. BLP applies to LaRouche (LaRouche 2, post-decision)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>Suppoert topic ban for Tombe only right now-- this is the least we can do to improve editing in this area. I&#39;ve watched this for a year or so, and Tombe&#39;s behaviour makes an impossibly uncomfortable and disruptive environment for other editors.

Having run through the history of this all I&#39;m seeing from Tombe is a stubborn attitude, which borders on harassment.

<li>As an interested party, my view is that the argument has gone on much longer than necessary because the controversial material in question was initially opposed as a knee jerk reaction on the erroneous belief that is was unsourced original research. Although that idea has now been dispelled, the momentum of those who opposed the material in the first place has kept the argument going.

<li>As one of the involved editors, in my view there are two issues with respect to David Tombe that make it difficult to work cooperatively with him. The first is David&#39;s complete disregard for reliable sources. The long talk page debates are due in part to other editors trying to teach David correct physics (and him teaching them his version of physics) usually without directly talking about sources. For the last little while I&#39;ve tried to eschew such behavior and to keep strictly to quoting and discussing sources. This has had very limited effectiveness. However, it was through a source provided by another editor that I became aware of the Lagrangian mechanics usage of the term which I was previously unaware of. The second and more problematic issue is David&#39;s interactions with editors that disagree and resist his fringe POV pushing, which the report I made at <a href="" title="WP:WQA">WP:WQA</a> touches upon. When a request for a source results in something like <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Centrifugal_force&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294447672" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Centrifugal_force&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294447672">this</a>, what can you do? Since I&#39;m an involved party, I won&#39;t &#34;vote&#34;, but I definitely support a topic ban for David Tombe. --<a href="" title="User:FyzixFighter">FyzixFighter</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:FyzixFighter">talk</a>) 20:11, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>My two cents, from a somewhat-involved editor: An argument with David Tombe about physics is like an argument with <a href="" title="Jim Marrs">Jim Marrs</a> about who assassinated <a href="" title="JFK">JFK</a>. If this was an argument about whether JFK was killed by aliens, we would have long ago banned the editor who was actively researching and promoting fringe theories. But David Tombe, who is actively researching and promoting (<a class="externallink" href="http://www.wbabin.net/science/tombe14.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.wbabin.net/science/tombe14.pdf"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.wbabin.net/science/tombe14.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.wbabin.net/science/tombe14.pdf">http://www.wbabin.net/science/tombe14.pdf</a></a> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.wbabin.net/science/tombe26.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.wbabin.net/science/tombe26.pdf"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.wbabin.net/science/tombe26.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.wbabin.net/science/tombe26.pdf">http://www.wbabin.net/science/tombe26.pdf</a></a>) his own fringe physics theories, is still here and still editing. Why? I don&#39;t know. Probably because most administrators don&#39;t know any physics so can&#39;t follow what&#39;s going on. --<a href="" title="User:Sbyrnes321">Steve</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Sbyrnes321">talk</a>) 20:38, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Would it be possible to have separate sections for the proposed topic ban for Brews and proposed topic ban for David? I&#39;m betting that several editors have stronger feelings with respect to one of them - I know I do. Some of the responses below are about one of the editors, only a few are talking about both. The WQA reported that might have partially precipitated this report was about only one of these editors. It could also help to focus the discussion a bit. --<a href="" title="User:FyzixFighter">FyzixFighter</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:FyzixFighter">talk</a>) 02:38, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>FyzixFighter, there was an opportunity for compromise tonight on the centrifugal force page. You turned it down. You reverted my edit once again. You are getting bold because you have seen favourable noises on this page coming from editors who haven&#39;t got the first clue about the subject matter. But even any honest editor who doesn&#39;t know about physics would be able to see that my edit tonight was a genuine attempt to solve the impasse. You clearly don&#39;t want a compromise. I would request that anybody considering your suggestion here should look at the last two edits at centrifugal force before making any important decisions. If that were to be done by an honest and objective administrator I think that it would be you that would be subjected to the topic ban. <a href="" title="User:David Tombe">David Tombe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David Tombe">talk</a>) 02:54, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Editing_physics_and_math_articles_requires_extensive_discussions">Editing physics and math articles requires extensive discussions</span></h4>
<p>I&#39;ve not interacted a lot with Brews, but from what I&#39;ve seen he has the right approach toward editing physics articles. There was a dispute on the wavelength article that we at wikiproject physics were alerted to. When I took a quick look at the talk page there, I saw that while Brews was arguing on the basis of physics, the others shot that discussion down by citing from other sources and disputing things based on wiki law procedure etc.</p>
<p>Now, if you&#39;re dealing with a kook who doesn&#39;t know much about physics, then sticking to wki law may be appropriate, any discussions of the actual physics would be a waste of time. But Brews is an expert in physics and there can sometimes be difficult issues that one has to talk about even in case of elementary physics topics (usually this then has to do with finding rigorous definitions). </p>
<p>Let me give one typical example of a article in which things went terribly wrong. It was never discussed here, precisely because there was never a dispute between editors. The article <a href="" title="Helmholtz free energy">Helmholtz free energy</a> contained many mistakes for many years, until 2008. Not just small minor mistakes but huge mistakes that were never corrected. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helmholtz_free_energy&#38;oldid=212028025" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Helmholtz_free_energy&#38;oldid=212028025">this was the latest flawed version</a>, the section &#34;mathematical development&#34; was totally wrong. And similar mistakes were corrected by me in many other thermodynamics articles, so it was a systematic problem.</p>

<p>The only realistic way this error could have been corrected earlier is if someone had questioned the derivation and discussed that on the talk page, basically the way Brews goes about his business. The tradional wiki way of arguing on the basis of sources alone does not work well for these sorts of topics. The error is most conspicuous when you actually study the equations using paper and pencil and write about any problems on the talk page. The fact that what was written is in conflict with the literature would not easily lead to someone noticing the error. It may als be the case that there exist sources in which the erroneous derivation can be found. It is well known that in engineering and chemistry texts you can often find flawed derivations.</p>
<p>Of course, there are then other textbooks in which you can find the correct derivation. The problem is then that if you have someone who is resisting the correction being made, he could always dispute your source in the basis if his source. If you want to discuss the actual physics to settle the dispute, he could shoot that discussion down.</p>
<p>This is how Brews is being treated and that is completely wrong. <a href="" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Count Iblis">talk</a>) 18:57, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>Comment: I disagree. It would seem to me that the core Policies effectively <i>insist</i> that we absolutely do not derive any equations ourselves, obviously this is <a href="" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and not <a href="" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, <i>no matter how correct your derivation</i>. If &#34;expert[s] in physics ... dicuss the actual physics to settle the dispute,&#34; you are then conducting research, and using the talk page of the article as your secondary source. Obviously this will not work.  The issue of errors in existing secondary sources seems well-handled by <a href="" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I think the erroneous approach that <a href="" title="User:Count Iblis">User:Count Iblis</a> advises here is a common and systemic flaw in articles on science and engineering. IMHO. <a href="" title="User:Eaglizard">Eaglizard</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Eaglizard">talk</a>) 21:55, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The core policies clearly led to severely flawed articles on thermodynamics and then Count Iblis came along in 2008 and rewrote them based on his notes he uses for teaching. So, it seems to me that I would be justified to invoke <a href="" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> here. The articles I&#39;m talking about were so flawed that any Prof. who teaches this subject who would have stumbled on the pages, should have warned his students to ignore the pages. Worse then not having studied a subject is having it learned wrongly. </dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Note that when we at university discuss teaching this subject with grad students and think about problems for students, we sometimes discuss things on the blackboard amongst ourselves. Is that &#34;original Research&#34;? Of course not! Why can&#39;t we look everything up in a book? We do do this, but a book doesn&#39;t always give you all the relevant details. Some subtle things are sometimes missing, some details are found in some other chapters. Note that the very reason why students are given difficult practice problems is precisely because you need to actually solve problems yourself to master the subject.</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Writing a wiki article that explains things from first principles is as hard as teaching the subject at university. This can thus only be done by someone who is expert enough to be able to derive everything from first principles. And he must actually derive everything that goes in the wiki article himself to be absolutely sure it is explained correctly. </dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The mathematical derivation <b>is</b> the ultimate verification, not the citation to some book. Because what&#39;s in the book &#34;Fundamentals of Statistical and Thermal Physics&#34; on page 432 is only verifiable to someone who has the necessary physics background to be able to understand this book and has read the first 431 pages. So, a statement quoted from page 432 in isolation is not really a good verification of any statement. <a href="" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Count Iblis">talk</a>) 22:55, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>This is not a good excuse to ignore all rules.

<dd>I agree with many of the points made by <a href="" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a>, but especially the last. The biggest problem with Wikipedia is lack of authority, and that is why a derivation is very important in WP: it provides credibility. Some editors think math is gobbledy gook, but in fact it is a succinct language devised to avoid logical error, or enable error to be traced back to the initial assumptions. It is not window dressing. It is exposition. It is not equivalent to its conclusions because it helps make the concepts clear. <a href="" title="User:Brews ohare">Brews ohare</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Brews ohare">talk</a>) 23:24, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

You&#39;ve made enough mistakes in your math-heavy stuff that you can&#39;t credibly claim that this &#34;succinct language&#34; is inherently more accurate or reliable than any other creation of fallible editors.

<dd>If that&#39;s what <a href="" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> says, then that is not applicable to some physics and math articles because if someone cannot understand the mathematical derivation, that person would not be able to understand the source. Often it is possible for an expert to explain a result from some technical physics subject that is taught at upper level graduate university, in such a way that it is understandable to high school students. But then just writing down the result without explanation and just giving a citation to the source which the target audiance cannot understand is a nonsensical thing to do. It is far better to present a taylor made derivation that can be understood by the target audience. Only then does the stament become verifiable to the target audience.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>The examples of the flawed thermodynamics articles I gave prove my point. The flawed versions contained more references and were verifiable in the way <a href="" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> requires. However, no one actually verified the content in that way, which explains why the huge mistakes coulkd have remained in the article for so many years. When I rewrote the articles, I decided not to give references to the literature. It is not that such references cannot be given, but giving the references would probably lead people to not check for errors. I derived everything from first principles in the articles, so these derivations themselves serve as the verification.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Giving a ref. where the derivation can be found is pointless, because if someone needs to verify the derivation in that way, then that person doesn&#39;t have sufficient knowledge to understand the article.

<dd>Gah. What&#39;s you&#39;re espousing is somewhere between highly admirable and slightly stupid. It&#39;s admirable, because you can IAR to make it work, but it&#39;s stupid because without verifiability somebody sooner or later will come along and <i>fix</i> it (i.e. mess it up) from sources. The wikipedia holds verifiability higher than truth. You&#39;re saying that truth is more important, but it&#39;s unstable in the wiki, unless it&#39;s also verifiable. You&#39;re nearly always much better off finding a reliable source that actually gets it right and pointing to that- there&#39;s no prohibition at all against linking to grad-level textbooks.- (<a href="" title="User:Wolfkeeper">User</a>) <b>Wolfkeeper</b> (<a href="" title="User_talk:Wolfkeeper">Talk</a>) 22:17, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I&#39;m highly impressed with everything that Count Ibliss has said. It&#39;s time that those truths were spoken. Sources can be used maliciously, and that is happening right now on the centrifugal force page. I am being billed as the villain who doesn&#39;t abide by sources, and attempts are being made to get me removed from the project. But the truth is that certain elements are trying to keep well sourced key facts about centrifugal force off the page in the name of scientific political correctness, and hiding behind wikipedia&#39;s rules and regulations on consenus. I should emphasize the word &#39;consensus&#39; because ultimately it has got nothing to do with sources. Any group of three can gang up against a single editor and claim to be on the side of sources. If the single editor produces a conflicting source, the other three only need to deny the contents of that source, and they will prevail by playing the consensus card while claiming to be playing the sources card. This has been going on at centrifugal force for over two years. And this entire thread here is a misrepresentation of the facts. Brews ohare is not my opponent in this. I have done collaborative editing with Brews ohare on other physics articles and it has never led to an edit war. The difference with centrifugal force is that there are certain other editors involved who are destroying any positive outcome from the discussions by continually opposing any important edit that I make. You can see that right now. If anybody wants to know the truth about this, go to &#39;centrifugal force&#39; now and watch FyzixFighter playing his game of &#39;textbook whist&#39;. Look at the history section for the last few days and you will see that it is only FyzixFighter who wants to remove my edits. But this thread has created a situation in which I am in the dock and FyzixFighter has been able to come along and act as an innocent prosecution witness. If you want to talk about topic bans then you should start by bringing in personnel who actually understand what the dispute is about, and you should bring every involved editor into the dock. This thread, by its very nature is totally biased because it has arbitrarily sought out two editors in particular without the slightest explanation as to why those two editors have been singled out, and then allowed their opponents in the dispute to come along as if they were innocent upstanding victims and make their complaints. <a href="" title="User:David Tombe">David Tombe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David Tombe">talk</a>) 00:22, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>Let me give two examples of successful talk page discussions were disputes were settled. In both cases discussing the physics form first principles was essential while direct quotes from sources were misleading. </p>
<p>Example 1:</p>
<p><a href="" title="Talk:Special relativity/Archive 17">Discussion with Ed Gerck</a></p>
<p>Ed Gerck is basically quoting things out of context from the literature and coming to erroneous conclusions. To see that he is wrong requires a working knowledge of special relativity. Refuting qoutes by Ed Gerck by directly by other quotes would not be a practical way to end the dispute. I&#39;m pretty sure that had there been no expert editors at the special relativity page, Ed Gerck&#39;s edits would not have beeen opposed, because to lay persons, everything looks ok: You have statements directly sourced from the literature and Ed Gerck provides direct quotes, so what could possiblly be wrong?  :)</p>
<p>Example 2:</p>
<p><a href="#Constant_Volume.3F" title="Talk:Helmholtz free energy">Discussion with anon on Helmholtz energy</a></p>
<p>Here the anon claims that the constant volume condition is not necessary, he has a source that says so. Of course, I have a source that claims that it is necessary, but merely stating that would not end the dispute. It is essential that one understands why the sources make different statements and that cannot be easily extracted from a source in the form of a single quote. You must have mastered the subject to see this. So, I explain in detail what is going on here. <a href="" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Count Iblis">talk</a>) 23:46, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I am not involved in the centrifugal force dispute, but I edit primarily mathematics articles, so I have a great deal of perspective on these issues. Count Iblis&#39; comments are very apt: one cannot solve these sorts of disagreements by just throwing around random quotes from sources. As Cout Iblis has said, verifying a reference to page 401 in a book really requires understanding what the author has done in the first 400 pages, and the conventions she has established. A broad understanding of the literature is necessary to determine which statements are in agreement with the literature and which are idiosyncratic or taken out of context. &#38;mdash;&#38;nbsp;Carl &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:CBM">CBM</a>&#38;nbsp;·&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:CBM">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 00:04, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is not really the place to discuss this, but I will note that stating the facts in a reasonable form in the article, and including multiple references to reliable, notable sources that support the case is the correct way to proceed in the wikipedia; but they need not be presented identically to the source, provided they are equivalent. If the references are challenged then they can be discussed on the talk page. If references are <i>not</i> given, under the wikipedia&#39;s policies the material can be removed <i>at any time</i>. For fundamental epistemological reasons this is probably the only way it can work here; ultimately we <i>do</i> rely on experts, just not expert <i>editors</i> <i>here</i>, but experts that have written books and such like.- (<a href="" title="User:Wolfkeeper">User</a>) <b>Wolfkeeper</b> (<a href="" title="User_talk:Wolfkeeper">Talk</a>) 00:22, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Example 1 that Count Iblis mentions above is IMO very similar to what we have going on with David. He&#39;s got his hands on a few sources and adopts a very fringe interpretation of what those sources say. When a wide spectrum of sources are provided that contradict his conclusions and interpretations, he disregards the mountains of additional sources as &#34;rubbish&#34;. Multiple editors including myself have tried walking David through the derivation, but he adopts some rather strange limitations to the derivation (his vector triangle argument) and uses very nonstandard terminology (like what he calls radial acceleration). The exercise gets repeated over and over with David refusing to admit that his interpretation of the derivation is wrong. It is because of the futility of the past endeavors that I&#39;ve stopped indulging David, and now try to limit discussion to talking about sources and how the sources can be synthesized together for the article. --<a href="" title="User:FyzixFighter">FyzixFighter</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:FyzixFighter">talk</a>) 00:56, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Some_comments_from_Brews_ohare">Some comments from Brews_ohare</span></h4>
<p>I agree that a lot of debate has circulated on the various centrifugal force pages, which include <a href="" title="Centrifugal force">Centrifugal force</a>; <a href="" title="Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)">Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)</a>; <a href="" title="Reactive centrifugal force">Reactive centrifugal force</a> and so forth. This debate is not all about the same thing, however, and none of these debates requires intervention limiting editors or topics for discussion, as is detailed next. </p>
<p>One subject has been a revolving discussion between D Tombe and various editors over the intuitive aspects of centrifugal force. D Tombe has his own perspective, and this discussion has generally not adopted his view. Nonetheless, IMO the articles have benefited by these discussions in becoming clearer and in adding particular examples that arose from these discussions. At the moment, this discussion is not prominent on the Talk pages. Related to this discussion is the desire by D. Tombe to eliminate <a href="" title="Reactive centrifugal force">Reactive centrifugal force</a> on the basis that it is not distinct. I don&#39;t think that is supported by anyone else, and is not a topic consuming great space. </p>
<p>A second subject, also involving D Tombe, is the status of the planetary orbit example as a significant departure from other examples, warranting special discussion. This debate is presently ongoing, and I do not wish to state an opinion upon its eventual outcome. It is largely a judgment call upon the significance of this topic and whether it warrants a lot of attention. That might be settled &#34;objectively&#34; by google counting, by logic, by eloquence, or by <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikilawyering" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikilawyering">WP lawyering</a> such as this present attempt to curtail discussion. </p>
<p>A third subject, that involved many editors over a long period of time is the so-called &#34;curvilinear Centrifugal force&#34;. This is a terminology that is rather mathematical in origin and relates to the use of (for example) polar coordinates, and to the interpretation of the radial equation in terms of centrifugal force. This particular issue has proved <i>very</i> difficult to deal with. The debate has been correspondingly extensive. At the moment, it has somewhat calmed down with the introduction of the Lagrangian approach to mechanics, which appears to subsume the &#34;curvilinear Centrifugal force&#34; as a special case.  Unfortunately, this topic will arise periodically because there are schools of opinion that take the view that &#34;curvilinear Centrifugal force&#34; is the <i>only</i> kind, and with sources that refer only to this interpretation. Thus, the talk page often is a long discussion that eventually acquaints editors with the existence of disparate sourced viewpoints. That discussion will recur as editors believing in the &#34;one and only one&#34; centrifugal force show up. I do not think any action to suppress this discussion by banning editors from participation makes any kind of sense. Censorship may well lead to a complete distortion of the articles by removal of one point of view in favor of the others.</p>
<p>A fourth subject of recent origin concerns the inclusion of the topic of absolute rotation in the article <a href="" title="Centrifugal force">Centrifugal force</a>. Here again, my view is that this is simply a normal WP discussion, and it is at least so far, not long-lived. It is not a suitable subject for any action in banning editors. <a href="" title="User:Brews ohare">Brews ohare</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Brews ohare">talk</a>) 19:47, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Some_comments_by_David_Tombe">Some comments by David Tombe</span></h4>

<p>I might be able to summarize the root cause of the dispute. It lies in the fact that the literature does not give a consistent view on the subject matter, and that the slant in the literature has been changing even in recent times. So part of the dispute even involves a conflict between two generations. On the issue of sources, we should take note of the very valid point that Count Ibliss has made. He correctly pointed out that sources can be used destructively against a person who has an overall comprehension of a topic. This is especially true when the literature contains a wide selection of confused and contradictory sources. This dispute is not a simple case of any particular editor ignoring sources.</p>
<p>The approach which I have wanted to promote (The Leibniz approach) is found in the modern literature. It is legitimate and its authenticity is no longer the subject of the dispute. But the Leibniz approach is not the approach which is being pushed as an introductory approach to centrifugal force in most modern textbooks. I have already conceded that point. The question is how to introduce the Leibniz approach into the article at the right level, bearing in mind that it not simply history.</p>
<p>The article has improved alot as a result of this ongoing debate. All editors involved have learned alot. A topic ban on any particular editor would merely give unfair advantage to a particular point of view. <a href="" title="User:David Tombe">David Tombe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David Tombe">talk</a>) 20:21, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No, a topic ban on one particular editor will allow them some time to think about the difference between <a href="" title="WP:TRUTH">finding the truth</a> and including only information that can be gleaned from <a href="" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> (emphasis on <i>reliable</i>).  We still hold articles about the Earth being flat, but thankfully reliable sources have proven otherwise.  Once alternative theories of this article have valid reliable sources, then we&#39;ll move on to them.

<p>Scientists are prone to disputes.  This is a given.  Are those disputes as seen on article talk pages wrong? No.  It is how scientists work.  It may not be how some writers on other stuff work, but it is a fact, and trying to use topic bans and the like is not the way to go in my opinion.  In the case at hand, neither editor appears anxious to lose the colloquy with the other.

<p>FyzixFighter, I stand by exactly what I wrote in that reply. You have been trying to turn the truth upside down. The convective term in Goldsetin&#39;s equation 3-12 is the centrifugal force. You are trying to tell us that it is the centripetal force. Put that equation side by side with the Leibniz equation. Now check off the two inverse square law gravity terms. They have negative signs and are attractive. They are the centripetal force. Now check off the two positive inverse cube law terms. They are the centrifugal force. And that&#39;s what Goldstein and Leibniz both call it. Why are you trying to suppress this equation? What is your ulterior motive? It&#39;s a pity that nobody is asking you this. <a href="" title="User:David Tombe">David Tombe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David Tombe">talk</a>) 17:46, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>It seems to me that the idea of censoring Mr Tombe, an editor who seems to be the most informed of the editors and who has worked very very hard to make this article a physically accurate and meaningful one, is misplaced. The problem is not Mr Tombe but the inability of the other editors to actually open up to the fact that their ideas may not be as correct as they beleive. I wonder why censorsip is necessary if the ideas of Mr Tombe opponents are able to stand alone by themselves. Obviously they can not stand up to his criticism. I oppose censorship of any editor of wikipedia. Mr Tombe has done more for wikipedia and been appreciated less than any editor I know here. Instead of censoring him you should be giving him an award for his efforts to get the correct physics into this article. I oppose this proposed action.

<p>I&#39;ve been actively involved in these disputes at <a href="" title="Centrifugal force">Centrifugal force</a>, too, and just saw this via the notification to Brews.  In these articles, David Tombe is the outlier who has been forcing the protracted debates for 15 months or so.  He is unyielding in his illogical and wrong-headed misunderstandings of all that the sources and other editors say.  Brews, on the other hand, is also pretty much unyielding, and generally responds to David&#39;s and others&#39; pushback by adding more and more mathematical and explanatory content, usually in runs of several dozen edits in a day, bloating articles and sections to big messes out of proportion to their relevance or importance.  I&#39;m sort of unyielding myself when I see people doing stuff like that, which is why I&#39;ve been in an edit war with Brews at <a href="" title="Wavelength">Wavelength</a> (and now also <a href="" title="Wave">Wave</a> and <a href="" title="Dispersion relation">Dispersion relation</a>), where he has actually been a much bigger problem than at <a href="" title="Centrifugal force">Centrifugal force</a>.</p>
<p>If I had my way, I&#39;d say ban both of them on any topics where they&#39;ve demonstrated an inability to collaborate with other editors.

I&#39;ve tried to get help via <a href="#Need_more_opinions_at_Wavelength" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physics">Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Physics</a> and other sections there, but what little I got, Brews felt free to ignore.

<dd>Whether an explanation is out of proportion is a hard call. Maybe in a printed encyclopaedia one weighting applies, and in WP a different weighting for this simple reason: the printed case is written by one or maybe a few authors who can set the balance as they see it, and let&#39;s say for the sake of argument, make a sound judgment. However, that same article on WP would not fly because there are readers &#38; editors that have different questions than those addressed (whatever their importance in some Platonic universe) and there are controversies that crop up that must be addressed somehow or they will go on forever. The basic points are these: WP is an interactive encyclopaedia with a very diverse audience. It is not a print encyclopaedia.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Irreverent_comments_by_Tim_Shuba">Irreverent comments by Tim Shuba</span></h4>

<p>This is all too typical, and a good example of why I choose not to work much on trying to provide serious content for this project.</p>
<p>David Tombe is a physics crank, and it is highly detrimental to treat him as if he is just another editor with the best interests of the encyclopedia in mind. It&#39;s easy enough to check Tombe&#39;s record off-wiki, where you may find a connection with a group of physics cranks called the Natural Philosphy Alliance, which I not so coincidentally tagged earlier for a g4 speedy deletion.</p>
<p>Cranks like Tombe run rampant on wikipedia, which is a big reason why physics articles in general are highly unreliable in spite of a lot of well-meaning contributors. Certain areas have undergone significant improvement since I&#39;ve been paying attention, in part due to the Fringe Noticeboard and a collection of reasonably sane editors, but the idea that someone wishing to work on an article like <i>centrifugal force</i> should have to worry more about coutering obvious cranks than producing good information is ridiculous. It&#39;s little wonder that so many articles are substandard.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t particularly blame the average admin for these crank-induced problems, but I doubt things will improve much unless admins with an understanding of the subject are allowed to keep cranks out of such articles. I know how it goes:  someone like me who says exectly what many others are thinking -- in this case, that Tombe is a detrimental crank and should be shown the door if we are a proper reference source -- is not showing good faith and is not following the doctrines of civility, et cetera. Well I don&#39;t care about that. I will continue (along with perhaps one or more of my legitimate sockpuppets) to do a very small amount to counter the large number of cranks found here, and let the chips fall where they may. Mostly, I have learned to just laugh at the pathetic state of the many articles that are crap due to this failure of the system.</p>
<p>So, whatever. Topic banning Tombe would be good for the other editors who are contributing to the article. In the wider context of cranks who soil many articles, it really doesn&#39;t matter. Until wikipedia decides that proper content is preferable to mollycoddling cranks and vandals, nothing substantial will change. <a href="" title="User:Tim Shuba">Tim Shuba</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Tim Shuba">talk</a>) 01:53, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>Despite the current opinion expressed here, there was a lot of progress, and most of the issues were resolved until Mr FyzixFighter wiped out all of the progress. So he is the one who should be banned. His action was uninformed and arbitrary. He was not involved in the compromises and then just wiped out all of the progress because of his personal dislike for Mr Tombe. This is not about the facts but about the personal ego trip of Mr FixitFighter who sees wikipedai as his personal play pen. I think you need to be discussing restrictions on him and slap his hand and ban him for awhile. Or better yet, ban him permanently as he is a big trouble maker. He doesn&#39;t know much about physics either.

<dd>Dougweller, I think that it&#39;s time that you took a look at the details of the argument. Do you have a physics background? I seem to recall at one stage reading that you do. The argument largely centres on one equation. That equation appears at 3-12 in Goldstein&#39;s &#39;Classical Mechanics&#39;. It is identical in purpose to Leibniz&#39;s planetary orbital equation. It is a force equation in the radial direction. One of those forces is the gravitational inverse square law force. Nobody is disputing that. The other force is the inverse cube law centrifugal force. FyzixFighter is doing all that he can to keep this equation off the page, outside of the history section. That is what the dispute is all about. There is no point in all this talk about sources. The facts are well sourced. You need to be asking FyzixFighter, and some others, as to why they are so keen to hide this equation. In FyzixFighter&#39;s latest edit on the talk page, he attempted to claim that the inverse cube law term was the centripetal force. This is this kind of blatant distortion of the facts that have caused all the problem. And at the same time, he is trying to falsely accuse me of inserting unsourced material.</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This is not about original research. This is about the total intolerance that comes with scientific political correctness. This explicit illustration of centrifugal force as a radially outward push that is induced by transverse motion is an intolerable fact in the eyes of many modern scientists because it is evidence of an absolute frame of reference for rotational purposes. It&#39;s for these same reasons that we are now witnessing a new editor, Martin Hogbin, wanting to remove the section on absolute rotation. I didn&#39;t even write that section. It is a modified version of a section on centrifugal potential energy that was on the centrifugal force article that I first saw in 2007.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I have never edited this article or interacted with David Tombe.  However I have been involved with another physics article (<a href="" title="Black hole">Black hole</a>), where an editor made repeated attempts to include material representing his view on the current understanding of General Relativity.</p>
<p>In the end, Wikipedia is not a place for scientists to debate theories with each other, and the talk pages should not be full of people lecturing each other on the correct interpretation of X theory or Y theory.  Articles should be based on <a href="" title="WP:RS">reliable, published secondary sources</a> - the knowledge of the editors is required to (a) find the sources and (b) rewrite the content in a form that avoids copyvio and is intelligible to the general reader.</p>
<p>Keeping that in mind provides a way to deal with the disputes of scientists that may not be to their taste, but is the one that meets the policies of Wikipedia.<a href="" title="User:Elen of the Roads">Elen of the Roads</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Elen of the Roads">talk</a>) 16:35, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Elen of the Roads, you have expressed an idealized picture that sometimes works. However, it evolves that sourced material is not invariably correct or correctly interpreted. I believe this point is made by <a href="" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a>, and accords with my own experience. He has suggested that at least in technical arguments a mathematical derivation sometimes can settle matters, although WP guidelines may not support such an approach. </dd>
<dd>I&#39;d add that requiring an entire article be intelligible to the general reader is not always desirable, and is in fact not true of WP as a whole (see particularly the math articles, which are impenetrable in many cases). I&#39;d suggest that the typical article should in fact have a gradation of levels, some intelligible to the general reader and some of interest to the more interested or demanding reader. <a href="" title="User:Brews ohare">Brews ohare</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Brews ohare">talk</a>) 17:31, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with your point about correct interpretation of a source, some sources can be less than crystal clear.  But the answer is not to go into reams of what is at the end of the day your own opinion (howevermuch based on your expert knowledge) on what the source means.  It is to go and find other sources that clarify what the first source meant.  Wikipedia is a tertiary source - it is a collection of the wisdom of secondary sources.  If source X is advancing a view that can be interpreted as (say) a challenge to Newton&#39;s 3rd law of motion, you go out and find what the scientific consensus is - or if there is no consensus, you find out whether this view is regarded as an acceptable theory by the scientific community, or whether it is disregarded as fringe nonsense.  I do wonder whether this is more difficult to do if one is an established expert (I mean, you might be a Cambridge professor of Newtonian mechanics for all I know, and actually be extremely well placed to say whether X interpretation is brilliant or barking), as what one would expect to do is explain it onesself.<a href="" title="User:Elen of the Roads">Elen of the Roads</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Elen of the Roads">talk</a>) 22:10, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>You&#39;ve hit the nail on the head here. The expert is not likely to spend a ton of time trying to track down hundreds of sources so he can outnumber the wrong view. He&#39;s likely to say, look Landau and Lifshitz and Schwinger say this, and they are experts. The opposing view will not necessarily agree upon the expertise. So one derives the result and says: look you guys, if you don&#39;t like it, show where it is mistaken. That will shut them up. They now will turn instead to Wikilawyering. <a href="" title="User:Brews ohare">Brews ohare</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Brews ohare">talk</a>) 05:15, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;m not convinced deriving the result shuts up the fringe theorists with perpetual motion machines anyway, but it may work with those who are just terminally confused, and I can understand why you do it.

Count Iblis says it well.  If many users feel that David is truly disruptive, then there are less draconian methods to address the problem, such as article probations and topic bans, and I&#39;d rather see these discussed by those <i>knowledgeable in the topic area</i>. <a href="" title="User:Antandrus">Antandrus</a> <a href="" title="User_talk:Antandrus">(talk)</a> 15:36, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Brews ohare and I were singled out for special mention despite clear evidence that others are involved on that talk page. A topic ban was then proposed for the two of us. It has rapidly turned into an arena where certain editors are campaigning to have a ban imposed on me. Let&#39;s not forget the fact that absolutely no offences have been committed. There are alot of malicious allegations being brandished by persons who admit to not knowing about the details of the situation.

<dd>I&#39;m sorry Shell but I have to respond to what you have just said. You seem to think that the fruitful discussions between myself and Brews, which have greatly expanded both our knowledge of this topic, seem to represent some kind of problem for wikipedia that warrants me being permanently banned. Last year I argued alot with Brews. The situation changed dramatically when Brews discovered Lagrangian mechanics. That was new to me, but the concepts were so closely related to what I had been explaining about polar coordinates that it changed the whole nature of the debate. Even FyzixFighter has admitted that he hadn&#39;t previously been aware of centrifugal force in polar coordinates. I think that you need to study the debate more carefully before advocating draconian measures. If you can&#39;t understand the subject matter, you shouldn&#39;t be involved here. <a href="" title="User:David Tombe">David Tombe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David Tombe">talk</a>) 13:40, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>This is not about whether or not someone understands the subject and its a bit offensive that you assumed the lack here and asserted it as a reason to invalidate my opinion (I see you&#39;ve done this with many others throughout the thread).  This is about your ability or lack thereof to conform to the standards expected of Wikipedia editors.  You seem to be under the misunderstanding that your assertion that you know more about the subject than others somehow excludes you from the policies and guidelines that every editor is expected to follow.

<li>Hey there Brews, I know you don&#39;t like this and are offended by it, as I&#39;m sure anyone would be in your position, but I&#39;d really appreciate it if you could dial back the personal attacks. I don&#39;t believe it&#39;s at all fair to characterize me as a &#34;hot-head&#34; since I&#39;ve been aware of this for over a year before coming to ANI, and the idea that the only problem here is that I or others are  <i>&#34;simply annoyed that they cannot deliver the pithy one-two punch that settles an issue. That hurts their self image as amazing savants.</i>&#34; Since I&#39;m the one who brought this here, I can only assume you are at least partially referring to me, and, aside from being dead wrong about my motivations, it&#39;s just not very nice. I would also remind all of you that you don&#39;t have to be an expert to contribute to an article, that&#39;s just not how Wikipedia works. The purpose here is to try and prevent this article from being a <a href="" title="WP:GARDEN">walled garden</a>, where only those who have been arguing for a year can even wrap their mind around what is being discussed on the talk page. I don&#39;t understand how anyone could look at the absurd length of these discussions and conclude that they are only reasonable discussion of the article itself. There seems to be a larger debate going on here about the accuracy of the underlying science behind the sources, making this a discussion that probably does not belong on Wikipedia at all, no matter it&#39;s length. It&#39;s not up to us to interpret the source material, or to create new theories, but merely to report on what is already available. I&#39;m sure you guys are aware of this, but you would never know it from that talk page. And David, badgering everyone (even those who don&#39;t want you banned!) and acting like this is a court of law is not helping you at all, although it from my perspective it is helpful as it demonstrates what it is like to try and interact with you. <a href="" title="User:Beeblebrox">Beeblebrox</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Beeblebrox">talk</a>) 16:29, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

I wouldn&#39;t drag out two of the contributors at random and put them in a pillory for their opponents and also the angry villagers to throw rotten cabbages at. <a href="" title="User:David Tombe">David Tombe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David Tombe">talk</a>) 12:41, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Hi <a href="" title="User:Beeblebrox">Beeblebrox</a>: Actually, I wasn&#39;t thinking about you in these remarks about &#34;hot-heads&#34; (I won&#39;t trouble to list who I <i>was</i> thinking about). I am very unsure why you have elected the role of taking out the garbage here; you seem to have little interest in contributing to this topic, so I guess it&#39;s &#34;general principles&#34; or &#34;the good of WP&#34;, or something. However, the parameters demarcating a &#34;reasonable discussion&#34; are pretty hard to pin down. They depend upon personalities, temperature of the debate, subtlety of the topic, and many factors other than what might seem sensible for a simple exchange of opinion about sources. </dd></dl>

<dd>Your <a href="" title="WP:GARDEN">walled garden</a> reference is a misuse of the terminology, but you seem to feel left out of the Talk page because you can&#39;t grasp what is going on there.

<li>Throughout all of this, including when I first became aware of all this a year ago, I was struck by how the two of you seem so smart about physics but so clueless about what is wrong with that talk page. That both of you, even now, simply say it is just a normal talk page conversation boggles the mind. I haven&#39;t even <i>tried</i> to grasp what you two are arguing about, to be honest. I, like most other users, have no interest in getting involved in an extremely protracted debate spanning 8 extremely long talk pages. That is what creates the &#34;chilling effect&#34; that leads to users shaking their heads and giving up on editing such an article. It was mentioned up the page that the last time this came to ANI, you guys agreed to take this off-wiki and argue elsewhere. So, in effect, by breaking that pledge, you have &#34;broken a rule.&#34; And I might add you seem to be ignoring my point that you are discussing the <i>science itself</i> as opposed to reporting on what is in the sources. Instead of responding to that point, you have chosen instead to repeatedly suggest that everyone else lacks the intelligence and/or knowledge of physics to dare to criticize you. If you two would simply agree, and actually stick to it this time, that this conversation does not belong on Wikipedia, we could put this to bed, but I&#39;m not such an optimist that I actually expect you to do that, that&#39;s why we&#39;re talking blocks and topic bans here. I may not be <a href="" title="Brian Greene">Brian Greene</a>, but I can figure out why a conversation like this is not helpful to Wikipedia without a degree from Oxford. <a href="" title="User:Beeblebrox">Beeblebrox</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Beeblebrox">talk</a>) 03:58, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd>

<dd>You want a reason, here&#39;s a reason, <b>you both give me a headache</b>. You both fail to grasp what this whole site is about. For a start Tombe starts telling people that no one but him and you have physics backgrounds, I&#39;m sorry but <i>you don&#39;t know me</i>, you have no idea what background I do or do not have. But io can tell you this with certainty David Tombe has no sense of perspective, he has 3,321 edits in under a year and yet only 22% are article edits, with 58% being talk edits. He <i>talks</i> about his edits three times as much (rounding up and down) as he actually edits. He has had four ANI threads, and has twice ranted on Jimbo&#39;s page about FyzixFighter (who has been here for 3 years and has a 60/20 main space edit/talk %). Even if he didn&#39;t spend all day creating drama he is not editing much outside of one page (in the last 1000 edits). The only reason I even started looking at him was because of his behaviour. Whether or not I understand physics has nothing to do with this, because this is <b><i>not about physics</i></b>. It&#39;s about the fact that David Tombe cannot grasp that <i>he</i> is harming this site by continuing to make edits, and then spending days complaining to <i>everyone</i> when they are reverted because on Wikipedia the phrase &#34;<i>I am cleverer than you</i>&#34; is not justification for bad editing. In summation, not about physics, is about both of you not seeing the wood for the trees. <a href="" title="User:Darrenhusted">Darrenhusted</a> (<a href="#Top" title="User talk:Darrenhusted">talk</a>) 05:27, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I think David knows just enough physics to be dangerous, and we know he has at least one physics book (an old edition of Goldstein&#39;s <i>Classical Mechanics</i>), and that he promotes radical and revisionary physics off-wiki.  So it&#39;s &#34;about physics&#34; at some level, but he doesn&#39;t get that wikipedia needs to be more conservative about how we portray things relative to sources, unlike his off-wiki domains where he can freely preach his version.  Brews knows more physics, and has more books, and is not usually pitching a radical POV, but he does get stuck on idiosyncratic POVs unsupported by sources at times, and it is very frustrating to try to work on an article when he&#39;s on one of those tears.  David eggs him on, and he eats that up, which I think is why he doesn&#39;t want David blocked, in spite of all the harm he does.  If you want to see Brews in typical form, look at <a href="" title="Wavelength">Wavelength</a> and its talk page from June 10 to July 10.  Srleffler and I and sometimes others had to fight like hell to hold back his nonsense; he got blocked at one point, resigned from the article at least twice, but is still at it (but more reasonably in the last week or so).  If you look at his contribs, you can see that he focuses on one article at time, doing typically 30 to 100 edits in a day with no other editor having a chance to comment until he has completely bloated the article.  It doesn&#39;t always provoke an edit war, but when it does, he digs in and keeps adding more and more complex stuff to overwhelm others.  He likes to bury his concepts in mathematical language, which he claims is precise and doesn&#39;t need to be sourced, but which he actually misuses to make faulty conclusions.  It&#39;s really sad to watch, and really hard to fight.  I think he&#39;s a lot like David, basically a big baby about not getting his way, rather than seeking a way to collaborate, listen to constructive feedback, and form a consensus.  I can&#39;t recall a time when another editor has supported him in an argument (though he did recently thank Lou Scheffer for coming up with a good alternative at <a href="" title="Speed of light">Speed of light</a>; I don&#39;t think Lou meant to be taking his side, but tried to acknowledge a sensible middle ground; this is another article where Brews has been a consistent complicator, and Martin Hogbin has been in the role of beating him back (I don&#39;t always agree with Martin, either, but this is another example of the horrible dynamic that ensues in most articles that Brews takes on).  Brews is proud of his massive amounts of contributions to wikipedia, but I&#39;m not so sure it&#39;s a net win, in terms of how hard he makes it to get articles right and sourced and not overly complex. <a href="" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dicklyon">talk</a>) 06:56, 17 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, there&#39;s <a href="" title="User:Dicklyon">Dicklyon</a>&#39;s side of this. It&#39;s not my view. The history of the <a href="" title="Wavelength">Wavelength</a> page shows Dicklyon adopting a stance, blanket deleting entire sourced subsections without suggestions for modification, refusing to entertain any opposing view no matter how sourced, eventually relaxing his stance as he comes to understand the subject, and eventually agreeing to an emasculated statement of the original suggestions. Along the way he blanket deletes with cryptic, often abusive remarks, makes few if any constructive suggestions for modification, and instead makes statements tantamount to: &#39;This is the way it is, I said so.&#39; And, naturally, he is an angel, and I don&#39;t play nice because my entries are too explanatory or too digressive (in his view). The history of <a href="" title="Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)">Centrifugal force (rotating reference frame)</a> shows Dicklyon entering the discussion with no clue about what is happening in planetary motion, being educated by Brews_ohare and D Tombe (which discussion is now held against them as a wasted use of the Talk page), and finally becoming (in his view) a savant with amazing insight. However, he still &#34;forgets&#34; the Lagrangian version of centrifugal force, a major sub-section of <a href="" title="Centrifugal force">Centrifugal force</a> and argues against the inclusion of the important (very well sourced) subsection describing the relation between centrifugal force and the notion of absolute rotation (based upon his own sensibilities, nothing more).  <a href="" title="User:Brews ohare">Brews ohare</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Brews ohare">talk</a>) 13:50, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>This circus was convened by editor Beeblebrox, ostensibly to discuss something benign like probation for the centrifugal force talk page, whatever that is supposed to mean. It is now rapidly sliding down the path towards becoming a warrant for <a href="" title="crucifixion">crucifixion</a>. Try to keep the discussions to the original point. Has there been too much talking going on at the centrifugal force talk page? If the answer is &#39;yes&#39;, then I&#39;m sure that all the editors involved will bear that fact in mind and try to shorten their edits on that page. <a href="" title="User:David Tombe">David Tombe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David Tombe">talk</a>) 12:16, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b>, this would sent a very bad precedent that would likely affect other articles. The way to deal with problematic editors is using the basic wiki laws like the 3RR violations mediation in case of edit warring. I explained above why discussing the actual physics is so important. Laclk of discussions led to severely flawed articles. Most people here do not know about that because it never led to conflict between editors. Only foccusing on conflicts between editors and taking measures to deal with that may adversely affect the way other articles are edited. <a href="" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Count Iblis">talk</a>) 13:45, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>It seems to me that there must be other people out there with the knowledge/expertise to write on this subject.

<dd>I agree.  The discussion is most certainly circular; the arguments seem to involve different frames of reference and a debate over which frame is correct/better (neither, according to Einstein!)  An outside editor (willing to spend a significant chunk of time churning through sources and assembling a fair representation of both sides) would do will for the page.  I also have to vote against the aforementioned bans.  I fail to see where any one editor has been more uncivil than any others.  Ban them all or ban none, but not some.  Perhaps warnings all around? <a href="" title="User:Clayt85">Clayt85</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Clayt85">talk</a>) 18:04, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>I&#39;d vote for this suggestion provided all participants e.g. including Martin Hogbin, Dicklyon, Wolfkeeper, FyzixFighter, etc. agree as well. Inasmuch as the instigator of this brawl, Beeblebrox, has never actually indicated any interest in contributing to the page, nor have Darrenhusted &#38; BWilkins, I don&#39;t expect much will happen during the hiatus.

<dd>I&#39;m amenable to this, but I wouldn&#39;t include Martin in the list of participants that should take a hiatus from editing the article and talk page. He&#39;s only recently started to participate on the talk page, and I would like to see what he could do while we take a break. I&#39;d also highly encourage that those like Iblis and CMD who think that just talking about the physics and going through the derivation will convince David of the errors of his ways and stop his fringe POV pushing to go ahead and try. It&#39;s easy enough to say, but doing it is another matter entirely. Others before you have tried to no avail, but maybe you&#39;ll succeed where they have failed. However, Brews, please don&#39;t discount the opinion of others like Darrenhusted and BWilkins just because they haven&#39;t participated on the article page. As I understand it, their opinions are based on David&#39;s action (failure to AGF and incivility) in general across multiple talk pages. --<a href="" title="User:FyzixFighter">FyzixFighter</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:FyzixFighter">talk</a>) 19:17, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>And I thought the point was that uninvolved editors gave their opinion. More to the point do you think that either the actions of you (ohare) or Tombe would encourage <i>anyone</i> to even try to edit any page that either of you have been near given the amount of drama you attract. What would happen if I made an edit at centrifugal force? Could I expect 4 ANI threads and two complaints to Jimbo as FF has been subjected to? At this point I would only try to contribute if I knew you were both banned from those pages. <a href="" title="User:Darrenhusted">Darrenhusted</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Darrenhusted">talk</a>) 00:38, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>This is turning into the same thing as the talk page we&#39;re commenting on, a very verbose debate in which nothing is settled. It would be good if a  couple of admins came forward and stated if they felt it warranted admin action or not. Since this has gone into <a href="" title="WP:TLDR">WP:TLDR</a> territory, I will try to summarize the core points here:</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>David Tombe and Brews ohare have had an extremely protracted debate for over a year on the centrifugal force talk page</li>
<li>This debate does not seem limited to discussion of the article but rather is a debate about the science itself and therefore an  inappropriate use of an article talk page</li>
<li>Previous attempts to resolve this, including reports at <a href="" title="WP:WQA">WP:WQA</a>, several <a href="" title="WP:RFC">WP:RFCs</a>, and a previous report here have failed to resolve the issue</li>
<li>David and Brews seem to feel that if you are not a physicist you do not have the right to comment on their contributions, and are unwilling to acknowledge that this is anything other than a normal talk page conversation</li>
<li>There was a consensus to ban or block David Tombe last year for these exact same reasons, but an admin chose to unblock him and apparently did not follow up and make sure this behavior did not recur. </li>
<li>The above suggestion that they voluntarily remove themselves for two weeks will not solve the underlying problem of an off-topic debate beyond the usual scope of article talk pages</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>For these reasons I believe some sort of administrative action is warranted, either in the form of a topic ban, blocking, or article probation <a href="" title="User:Beeblebrox">Beeblebrox</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Beeblebrox">talk</a>) 20:44, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I explained in detail in the extended discussion section, why the actions suggested by Beeblebrox would be a bad thing. One has to take into account that on this noticeboard page we only hear about disputes between editors. The fact that the way Brews edits articles has been very successfully used by me and others in correcting long standing and horrible errors without causing an disputes is a hard undeniable fact.</p>
<p>Now, it can be the case that an editor is talking too much on the talk page. But then it is up to the other editors to deal with that ocnstructively. Instead of moaning like Beeblebrox is doing here, one has to reach a conclusion on the talk page. If one editor is behaving in an obstructive way, then that canot prevent a consension being reached by all the pother editors. So, ultimately one can always proceed without that problem editor and if that problem editor still disrupts the article, you can come back here and raise more clear cut violations like 3RR etc. </p>
<p>If we take a shortcut by limiting Brews or David from discussing the physics/math on the talk page, then I see potential problems with other articles. We have had cases where extensive discussions based on physics were really necessary to settle disputes. In some cases there was one editor who was using sources in a misleading way and he was wikilawering. Now, such an editor could in the future come here and accuse the experts of talking too much physics and math. <a href="" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Count Iblis">talk</a>) 21:53, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Brews, whether the editors commenting here have tried to get involved in the debate on the article talk page or not is irrelevant. This is a report at ANI not an RFC. A report here asks uninvolved editors to look at the behavior of the editor(s) in question and give opinions based on the agreed upon standards of the Wiki community. It is not meant to get them involved in the actual debate on the talk page (that would be what an RFC or mediation is for), although it may lead to that.

<dd>Many disputes on article contents have been settled by lengthy discussions witout escalating to major conflicts, so on this page you&#39;ll find no trace of such disputes. That happens far often than unnecessary discusions that go on for too long. But a lay person cannot be expected to see the difference. So, if David and Brews were sanctioned for talking too much then I could also be sanctioned for talking too much on thermodynamics talk page articles. You can easily imagine some editor with some POV that is based on a misunderstanding of a source to come along and the only way that can be refuted is by a lengthy argument, because you can&#39;t always refute a quote out of context by a quote that counters that directly. <a href="" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Count Iblis">talk</a>) 13:33, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Count Iblis, with regards to David Tombe the problem goes far beyond just talking too much on the talk page. What is your opinion of the behavior described in the <a href="#User:David_Tombe_on_Talk:Centrifugal_force" title="Wikipedia:WQA">WQA report</a>? Is such persistent behavior acceptable or not, and if not what is the next recourse in getting David to change such behavior? --<a href="" title="User:FyzixFighter">FyzixFighter</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:FyzixFighter">talk</a>) 13:45, 18 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That&#39;s a far better way to address a problem. I.e. instead of complaining about very lengthy talk page debates, you cite specific incidences of verbal abuse. Sanctioning an editor based on that sounds  legitimate to me in principle (I haven&#39;t look at all the instances of alleged abuse yet). Beeblebrox treats Bews and David in the same way based on their lengthy talk page discussions. I.m.o., that&#39;s wrong.<a href="" title="User:Count Iblis">Count Iblis</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Count Iblis">talk</a>) 13:59, 18 July 2009 (UTC) </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>As is typical with Wikipedia, you fellows are trying to kill the wrong people. This entire problem is due to FyzixFighter who intervened after much of the long discussion between Brews and Tombe was worked out. FyzxFighter then swooped in and deleted Tombe&#39;s edits, which were at the final stage, and wiped out all of the progress. Hence I am a bit surprised that you are not discussing a ban on FyzixFighter, as he is obviously the source of the current problem. Now we have Mr Beeblebrox stepping in to make things worse. He is trying to establsh rules for editing physics articles when he doesn&#39;t know any physics. I will make this problem clear. The physics community has been arguing about the physics of centrifugal force for at least 200 years. Does he expect that wikipedia will produce a satisfactory article on this topic if wikipedia tries to enforce a conclusion that the physics community doesn&#39;t agree upon? I think not. The problem here is Wikipedia procedures and the way it handles disputes. The correct way is to allow both view points into the article while telling the reader there is a disute and letting him decide. Wikipedia thinks they can avoid mentioning there is a dispute and then determine which side is the correct side of the argument. Such a procedue is bound to ruffle feathers and is more than likely going to lead to wrong information in Wikipedia. Apparently, Mr Beeblebrox believe that the best solution is to choose up sides, like in a children&#39;s playground, and ostracise the bad boys from the playground. That is not a solution and will only help to keep Wikipedia&#39;s reputation for erronous information intact, and confirm why that reputation was properly earned in the first place.<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/72.84.66.220">72.84.66.220</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:72.84.66.220">talk</a>) 12:16, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Sorry sir but it is exactly about you. Your inability to understand the issues has resulted in a demand to kill two editors. That is simply wrong, and if you dont see that, you don&#39;t belong here in my opinion. This latest dispute was caused by FyzixFighter. Why didn&#39;t you make a move to block him? That would be a more productive move from my observations regarding the problems of trying to edit wikipedia articles. Mr FyzixFighter is always intervening when a compromise has been reached destroying the efforts of Mr Tombe to work out a solution. This is because Mr FyzixFighter doesn&#39;t know anything about physics and never will. He is just trying to cause problems for MR Tombe who does know physics. I don&#39;t think you understand the problems and simply want to kill the participants efforts because you don&#39;t understand them or physics.<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/71.251.188.202">71.251.188.202</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:71.251.188.202">talk</a>) 21:47, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>

FyzixFighter 3RR: FyzixFighter went over 3RR on exactly the same day as Tombe, by the same amount, at almost exactly the same time, by the same iffy &#39;last edit of the day + the next day&#39;s three edits&#39; method of counting. Like I care. What I do care about, though, is Fyz reporting it to Tombe on the talk page, and later here, in the collapsed &#34;Extended content&#34; section, when he was guilty of the same thing himself. My guess is he just didn&#39;t notice he had done it himself, the alternative is less likely.

<p>Dlabtot appears to be engaged in edit warring against consensus, a combination <a href="" title="WP:EW">WP:EW</a> and <a href="" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a> violation. He will argue that he just made one edit: <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andy_Murray&#38;diff=302867938&#38;oldid=302858466" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andy_Murray&#38;diff=302867938&#38;oldid=302858466">(diff)</a>. But I argue that one edit is a <a href="" title="WP:GAME">WP:GAME</a> intended to POV-trump a settled content dispute. (See <a href="#Handling_of_edit_warring_behaviors" title="WP:EW">WP:EW</a>.)</p>
<p>The key facts are: 
</p>
<ol>
<li>User ignored my edit summary providing the location of the concluded consensus discussion, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andy_Murray&#38;diff=302852840&#38;oldid=302828839" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Andy_Murray&#38;diff=302852840&#38;oldid=302828839">(diff)</a></li>
<li>user provided no exceptional revert reason in his edit summary, and </li>
<li>user posted nothing to the talk page. </li></ol>

<p>This user is a hardened veteran of talk, policy, and notice venues, with no newbie excuse for his behavior. He has previously been blocked for edit warring. </p>
<p><a href="" title="Andy Murray">Andy Murray</a> was hit by two WT:EL vigilantes.

That&#39;s 3 posts on the talk page, all addressing the issue in question. I&#39;ll assume you simply forgot about these posts when drafting your inflammatory accusation above.&#60;p&#62;An alternate summary might be this: a bunch of uninvolved editors responded to an RfC (including Dlabtot); you didn&#39;t like their responses; so you&#39;ve alternately reported them to AN/I or <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAndy_Murray&#38;diff=302665269&#38;oldid=302646968" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAndy_Murray&#38;diff=302665269&#38;oldid=302646968">out-and-out threatened them with malicious litigation</a> for their troubles. Of course, it could be argued that I&#39;m not a neutral party, since you applied the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Broda_Otto_Barnes&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=287956281" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Broda_Otto_Barnes&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=287956281">same sort of approach</a> in your interactions with me. So it&#39;s not like I&#39;m going to take action here - previous experience prejudices me - but if anyone&#39;s behavior warrants administrative attention in this regard, it&#39;s Milo&#39;s. <b><a href="" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User Talk:MastCell">Talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 07:00, 19 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I&#39;ve never seen an ANI closed by refusing to answer a consensus violation as being a content issue. But that&#39;s the way it is. </p>
<p>However, closing it without allowing an answer to a smear of the poster is another matter. Here is the post I was trying to make during the edit conflict:
...
3. user posted nothing to the talk page [about his revert. He had previously participated in a concluded RfC discussion, where he read that the consensus was described in a previous section. The consensus discussion: <a href="#Fan_site_link" title="Talk:Andy Murray">Talk:Andy Murray</a> ].

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There&#39;s a limit to how much history one can post. The RfC was concluded, but at your implied insistence that it matters, I&#39;ve added that. As you&#39;ve linked, Dlabtot already knew that the edit had consensus. Makes it worse for him, I&#39;d say.</dd>
<dd>The user I warned at the RfC, fooled two editors into answering the wrong question at the RfC, possibly by carelessness rather than malice. But it was still damaging to consensus, and that justifies the warning that if continued, they would face &#34;some kind of WP process, such as RfC/U or ANI&#34;. That warning looks completely by the book to me. </dd>
<dd>Yes, you&#39;re completely non-neutral. I&#39;ll refrain from likewise posting your egregious violation of consensus at BOB – unbecoming of an admin, to say the least. I invite a full review of your actions in the appropriate forum, but this isn&#39;t it. I suppose you&#39;re likely to blow smoke like this every time I post about another issue, but that&#39;s just an unfortunate part of the ANI reporting job.</dd>
<dd>Please move along and let consensus prevail for an edit that I did not vote on either way at the consensus discussion: <a href="#Fan_site_link" title="Talk:Andy Murray">Talk:Andy Murray</a>. <a href="" title="User:Milomedes">Milo</a> 08:24, 19 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

After <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302040148" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302040148">another editor restored my insertion</a>, it was <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=302040148" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=302040148">partly reverted again</a>. I allowed myself to <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=302050898" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=302050898">revert it</a> because we should have either a correct citation, or no sentence at all. </p>
<p>Following that, in <a href="" title="Talk:History of Transylvania">Talk:History of Transylvania</a>, I <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=302111325&#38;oldid=301378659" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=302111325&#38;oldid=301378659">explained my last edit (the revert)</a>. To this <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=302215861&#38;oldid=302111325" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=302215861&#38;oldid=302111325">I got an answer</a>, and then <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=302215861" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=302215861">I replied</a>. Up to here, everything is content related. Unfortunately,  <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=302276797&#38;oldid=302219451" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=302276797&#38;oldid=302219451">the second answer I got after this</a> contains such words: <i>&#34;Medieval Orthodox World was very very shocking backward and poor civilization.&#34;</i> The content discussion has nothing to do with medieval orthodox world. We were talking about including or not my citation that mentioned that in ca. 1600, Romanians amounted to about 60% of the population of Transylvania. Romanians are Orthodox (with a Greek-Catholic minority), while the other ethnic groups in Transylavania (Hungarians and Germans) are Catholic and Protestant. Perhaps, then I should have replied that we shouldn&#39;t mix religion, as it is not related to the issue. Unfortuanately, seeing the connection Orthodox=Romanian, and obviously disagreeing with the above statement, I replied in a manner that did not help calm my discussion partner&#39;s spirit. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=302316566" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=302316566">I said: &#34;I am reading this as a personal attack. Please, re&#60;s&#62;f&#60;/s&#62;tract it, or our discussion here is over.&#34;</a> At least I hoped I would here something &#34;you misunderstood, this was not a personal attack&#34;. Unfortunately, I got <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=302551850&#38;oldid=302321180" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:History_of_Transylvania&#38;diff=302551850&#38;oldid=302321180">this</a>: <i>&#34;MAny times, the mimic pipque is just a form (and reason) for escape from the defeat.&#34;</i> and <i>&#34;You call it anti-Orthodox or whatever anti***** etc... If something is unflattering for you. It&#39;s childish. As I said, It is not superiority feeling. The cultural/technologian economic societal differences between Orthodox Europe and Western cultured countries in Europe are similar to the differences between latino-Americaan South and English Speaking (USA Caanada) parts of the American Continent. But Average American people are open minded and they don&#39;t despise/contemn for bacwardness the Latino-Americans.&#34;</i> </p>
<p>I am in a difficulty to keep this dialog. Please, advise.</p>

<dl>
<dd>P.S. I am expected to explain why the statements below are incorrect. But it is very difficult to think what arguments should I use with an editor that has just said the above.
<ul>
<li><i>&#34;The Orthodox church wanted to preserve its exclusivity in all sphere of cultural and intellectual life. Therefore secular intellectuals did not existed in orthodox world until the 18th century (in Russian Empire) and until the 19th century in Balkanian territories.&#34;</i>
<ul>
<li>They did exist since 1630s.</li></ul></li>
<li><i>&#34;There are 4 main historic development levels for every counry. 1. nomad half-nomad (sepherd the majority) 2. feudal- (agricultural) 3.industrial 4.post-industrial. All Western-Christian states arrived to the 2. development level (feudal-agricultural) from year 600 to 1000AD. In Balkanian Orthodox countries (except Greeks) most people lived pastoral sepherd lifestyle in the balkanian mountains until the 14th (!!!) century. In romanian territories the half-nomad sepherd lifestyle remained more important than (the more civilized) agricultural lifestyle until the the 16th century.&#34;</i> 
<ul>
<li>There were also <a href="" title="sedentary">sedentary</a> populations that were not nomad. Also it is very difficult to explain how a people has managed to create two independent principalities in 14th century and for over a 100 years successfully defend against Ottoman Armies of up to 150,000 strong, while apparently &#34;half-nomad sepherd lifestyle remained more important than (the more civilized) agricultural lifestyle until the the 16th century&#34;. </li></ul></li>
<li><i>&#34;Have you ever read books about the history and developments of fine arts and architecture? Don&#39;t forget that the successor of the true Byzantine fine arts and architecture is the Middle-Eastern Islamic World. But the motive of onion-dome appeared foremost in Islamic word. In the Orthodox Balkan , average people wore Kaftans (clothes from Islamic world) and primitive sandals (instead of shoes) until the 1860&#39;s.&#34;</i>
<ul>
<li>no comment. IMHO, this borders an attack on one&#39;s ethnic group.</li></ul></li>
<li><i>&#34;Read about: <a href="" title="Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality">Orthodoxy, Autocracy, and Nationality</a>&#34;</i>
<ul>
<li>It&#39;s about Tsarist autocracy, not about every Orthodox nation. I have somehow to explain that there were also other Orthodox countries except the 19th century Russian Empire. </li></ul></li>
<li><i>&#34;There is a well known historical reason for this. Byzantium was always in close contact with the absolutism of the Eastern peoples, the ideas of despotism derived from there.&#34;</i>
<ul>
<li>no comment</li></ul></li>
<li><i>&#34;it produced the state-church in all Orthodox countries, executing the power of government administration and supervision, almost as an organ of police. In such a political system, the clergy cannot progress and remains on a low level, the state does not develop either, life becomes rigid. (...The history of the Byzantine empire is a monotonous story of the intrigues of priests, eunuchs, and women, of poisonings, of conspiracies, of uniform ingratitude. similar to an Asian country) This is the cause of the amazing primitiveness one notices when crossing the border of Orthodoxia.&#34;</i>
<ul>
<li>It is always very hard to justify you are not &#34;primitive&#34;...</li></ul></li>
<li><i>&#34;In the middle of the Twentieth Century, led by Bolshevik Russia, Slav nationalism conquered Central Europe, but that was all it has achieved: it could not give more than what is its essence: hardly anything more than Byzantinism manifested as Bolshevism.&#34;</i>
<ul>
<li>I sincerely believe there was much more to Bolshevism than a manifestation of Byzantine tradition. It&#39;s like saying Fascism is a manifestation of Protestantism. Try to explain this logic is not true...</li></ul></li>
<li><i>&#34;Romanian as a country name or name for an ethnic group is young. It was born just in the modern period.&#34;</i>
<ul>
<li>The word <a href="" title="Romania">Romania</a> indeed was coined in 19th century, but <a href="" title="Romanians">Romanians</a> called themselves &#34;români&#34; since they are known. Due to geography, Romanians did not have a single country until 19th-20th century, but 3 principalities: <a href="" title="Wallachia">Wallachia</a>, <a href="" title="Moldavia">Moldavia</a>, and <a href="" title="Transylvania">Transylvania</a>. In the former two they were both the nobility and the peasants, in the latter they were the peasants, while the nobles spoke <a href="" title="Hungarian language">Hungarian</a>.&#60;/small&#62;</li></ul></li></ul></dd></dl>

 , a.k.a. Robert Redfern, has done nothing in his entire time on Wikipedia but try to promote the use of <a href="" title="Serratiopeptidase">Serratiopeptidase</a>. He has been blocked several times for his disruptive behaviour.</p>
<p>He has resumed this behaviour, and I would ask he now be community banned, as he&#39;s wasting a lot of time on patently unusable material. </p>
<p>For instance, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serratiopeptidase&#38;diff=302931354&#38;oldid=302837034" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serratiopeptidase&#38;diff=302931354&#38;oldid=302837034">his latest replace-entire-article-with-whatever-the-hell-he-wants</a>  contains the following:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Likewise, here&#39;s what he thinks is an appropriate edit to <a href="" title="Bandolier (journal)">Bandolier (journal)</a> (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bandolier_(journal)&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=284886334" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bandolier_(journal)&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=284886334"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bandolier_" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bandolier_">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Bandolier_</a>(journal)&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=284886334</a>), as it published a study on Serratiopeptidase he dislikes. [His changes are marked in bold]</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think he has a single edit that isn&#39;t either blatant attack pieces or blatant promotion.  <a href="" title="User:Shoemaker&#39;s Holiday">Shoemaker&#39;s Holiday</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Shoemaker&#39;s Holiday">talk</a>) 13:10, 19 July 2009 (UTC)</p>
