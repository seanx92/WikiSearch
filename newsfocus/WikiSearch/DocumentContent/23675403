Sounds like there are some religious people who don&#39;t want to hear anything against their beliefs. The facts which I put on that article are from one of the most reliable books of Muslims (<a href="" title="Nahj al-Balagha">Nahj al-Balagha</a>)) which can not be denied specially by Muslims! If someone has to delete the facts which have came from that book then the whole article must be deleted. I am sure if I add those contents again, there are LOTS of muslims who rush into the article and delete them immediately. Since this encyclopedia is a NON-BIASED source and IT SHOULD CONTAIN ALL RELAIBLE MATERIAL whether positive or negative to someone, I demand that admins protect that page from vandalism and punish the vandals.--<a href="" title="User:Breathing Dead">Breathing Dead</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Breathing Dead">talk</a>) 02:40, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

His views on women are stated in <a href="" title="Nahj al-Balagha">Nahj al-Balagha</a>, which is the most famous book about Ali and is regarded as the second <a href="" title="Qoran">Qoran</a> by lots of <a href="" title="Muslim">Muslims</a>. The followings are some examples which can be found in <a href="" title="Nahj al-Balagha">Nahj al-Balagha</a>:</p>

<ul>
<li>Woman is a scorpion whose grip (having sex with) is sweet.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sayings.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sayings.php">Nahj al-Balagha - Saying 61</a></li></ul>


<ul>
<li>Jealousy in woman is unpardonable but in man it is a sign of his faith in religion.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sayings.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sayings.php">Nahj al-Balagha - Saying 123</a></li></ul>
	

<ul>
<li>O&#39; ye peoples! <b>Women are deficient in Faith, deficient in shares and deficient in intelligence.</b> As regards the deficiency in their Faith, it is their abstention from prayers and fasting during their menstrual period. As regards deficiency in their intelligence it is because the evidence of two women is equal to that of one man. As for the deficiency of their shares that is because of their share in inheritance being half of men. So beware of the evils of women. Be on your guard even from those of them who are (reportedly) good. Do not obey them even in good things so that they may not attract you to evils.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=79" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=79">Nahj al-Balagha - Sermon 79</a></li></ul>


<ul>
<li>Daily prayers are the best medium through which one can Seek the nearness to Allah. Hajj is Jihad (Holy War) for every weak person. For everything that you own there is Zakat, and Zakat of your body is fasting. <b>The Jihad of a woman is to afford pleasant company to her husband</b>.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sayings.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sayings.php">Nahj al-Balagha - Saying 135</a></li></ul>


<ul>
<li>Your society will pass through a period when cunning and crafty intriguers will be favoured by status, when profligates will be considered as well-bred, well-behaved and elegant elites of the society, when just and honest persons will be considered as weaklings, when charity will be considered as a loss to wealth and property, when support and help to each other will be considered as favour and benevolence and when prayers and worship to Allah will be taken up for the sake of show to gain popularity and higher status, <b>at such times regimes will be run under the advice of women and the youngsters will be the rulers and counselors of the State</b>.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sayings.php" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/sayings.php">Nahj al-Balagha - Saying 102</a></li></ul>
	

<ul>
<li>Beasts are concerned with their bellies. Carnivores are concerned with assaulting others. <b>Women are concerned with the adornments of this ignoble life and the creation of mischief herein</b>. (On the other hand) believers are humble, believers are admonishers and believers are afraid (of Allah).<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=152" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/SermonDetail.php?Sermon=152">Nahj al-Balagha - Sermon 152</a></li></ul>
	

<ul>
<li>Do not seek the advice of women, their verdicts are often immature and incorrect and their determinations are not firm. You must guard and defend them and act as a shelter to protect them from impious and injurious surroundings and infamous sights, this kind of shelter will keep them well-protected from every harm. Their contact with a vicious and sinful atmosphere (even with all the shelter that you can provide) is going to prove more harmful than being left with protection. Do not let them interfere with affairs where you cannot personally guide or protect them. Do not let them aspire for things which are beyond their capacities. <b>They are more like decoration to humanity and are not made to rule and govern humanity.</b> Exhibit reasonable interest in things which they desire and give importance to them, but do not let them influence your opinions and do not let them impel you to go against your sane views.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/LetterDetail.php?Letter=31" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nahjulbalagha.org/LetterDetail.php?Letter=31">Nahj al-Balagha - Letter 31</a></li></ul>

<dd>First, to try and summarize Ali&#39;s views on women you need a reliable secondary, preferably scholarly, source doing so. You can&#39;t just pick out some quotes and say that summarizes his views on women. Second, who said I believe everything in the Nahj al-Balagha is true? And why are inquiring as to my beliefs anyway? You are right though, I am a Muslim, but I also am a pothead and I am too high to care about this right now.

<dd>according to the Wikipedia article,  no Sunni scholar, and even some Shi&#39;a ones, do not attribute the book to Ali.  The authenticity of these views is therefore a matter of dispute among Muslims. If they are included, they must  be given in context, it is possible that these particular sayings are regarded by all Muslims as authentic, but there would need to be some information about that. We can&#39;t put for the views of one of the sects as The Truth--not in Wikipedia.

<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t find a <a href="" title="WP:TE">WP:TE</a> on <a href="" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>: <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302130338" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302130338"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302130338" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302130338">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302130338</a></a> by Int. If it is stated that the Greeks colonized the southern area IV BC Romans north area II AD so natural question is what did they colonized?Were there any people etc  Everyone accepts the fact that Illyrians laid in Serb territory at that time and their history on that area, what kind of <a href="" title="WP:TE">WP:TE</a> is here?! Romans and Greeks are mentioned, but the Illyrians the people who really lived and inhabited the areas should not be mentioned?! And if they are mentioned this is tendentious?!Why?It is the opposite standing that could look tendentious. Everyone mentioned except Illyrians, the people who inhabited the area?! SO no <a href="" title="WP:TE">WP:TE</a> here.</li>
<li>As for the cn tags I agree that it is wrong to put them behind ref, but I must stress the fact that Int didn&#39;t remove anything from the text, he was pointing to the POV standing of the author(maybe in wrong way with his cn tags) and when he discussed in the talk page here <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#The_Ottoman_period" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#The_Ottoman_period"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#The_Ottoman_period" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#The_Ottoman_period">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#The_Ottoman_period</a></a>  none tried to discuss according to <a href="" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> <a href="" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> <a href="" title="WP:R">WP:R</a> etc wiki rules, the result was a personal attack and a topic ban proposal.</li>
<li>For the previous accusations of sock and etc there has been much said before, Int wasn&#39;t guilty I don&#39;t know why it was brought up here again. <a href="" title="User:Aigest">Aigest</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Aigest">talk</a>) 08:41, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>IIF&#39;s persistent pushing of &#34;Kosovo is a country&#34; on <a href="" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic peoples</a> is disruptive and, in my view, tendentious. It illustrates a problem faced by any article whose scope includes the Balkans or any map covering that region: until the statehood of Kosovo is determined either at some binding international level or by en.wiki policy such articles can&#39;t do right for doing wrong. IIF accuses <a href="" title="Slavic people">Slavic people</a> of non-neutrality because it contains a map - intended to give readers a general geographical awareness of the distribution of Slavs at a resolution level limited to countries - which does not show Kosovo as separate from Serbia.  IIF is on a hiding to nothing trying to force such articles to change their depiction of Kosovo, because the Serbians will then be justified in jumping in and demanding a reversion.  IIF has ignored the substantive arguments made on the article&#39;s talk page and continued to push his own POV. Whatever sanction is applied must take into account not only articles related directly to Kosovo, but also the evidence of IIF&#39;s willingness to take his unproductive <a href="" title="WP:BATTLE">WP:BATTLEs</a> and <a href="" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAPboxes</a> to any other article with a tenuous link. -- <a href="" title="User:Timberframe">Timberframe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Timberframe">talk</a>) 09:40, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is no longer a simple dispute. The dispute was a couple of weeks ago. He couldn&#39;t accept that Wikipedia consensus was against his POV, and he went ahead with his POV pushing, on the Kosovo article, on many other articles related to Kosovo or Albanians. Let me explain it this way: let&#39;s say we all agree that the Alps are a mountain range, but one user simply doesn&#39;t and then keeps repeating it. This is pretty much what&#39;s happening here. Kosovo is a region, some see it as a province, some as a country, but Interestedinfairness wants it to be a country, even attempting to prove it&#39;s not a region or territory. ?!!. I don&#39;t even have the energy to repeat all the other Wikipedia rules he has broken, it&#39;s all on the Kosovo talk page, or on his talk page... Athenean&#39;s examples are proof enough, but there are MANY more examples of Interestedinfairness&#39; disruptive behavior, if you have the energy to look through his edits which are highly disruptive and this is making other constructive editors tired of arguing with this POV-pushing user over and over again. He had his chance, he had many chances, he blew them all. Enough. Simply enough. --<a href="" title="User:Cinéma C">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;<b><i>Cin</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:crimson&#34;&#62;<b>é</b>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;<b><i>ma</i></b> &#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:crimson&#34;&#62;<b><i>C</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> 18:07, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;m a previously uninvolved editor, who is even &#39;on his side&#39; (in as much as I support the independence of Kosovo), yet I still seem to be on the reciving end of this user. Two examples in the last couple of days seem indicative of the general manner in which IIF approaches these topics:</dd>
<dd>He placed a   tag on <a href="" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic peoples</a> - we eventually worked out that the sole reason was that one of the maps didn&#39;t show Kosovo as a disputed region. The map was so small you couldn&#39;t make it out, but cue <a href="#Neutrality_tag" title="Talk:Slavic_peoples">a large section of soapboxing, disrupting to make a point and some wikilawyering for good measure</a>. Even after being asked to get down from the Reichstag, he still continued trying to make some kind of point, and followed up with <a href="#Offend.3F" title="User_talk:Ninetyone">a snide comment on my talk page</a>. </dd>
<dd>In addition, a similar incident at <a href="#Neuatrality_tags" title="Talk:Kosovo">Talk:Kosovo</a> showed all the same hallmarks - disruption, attempts at wikilawyering etc. To conclude, taking into account his other contribs, IIF does not appear to be able to make wholly constructive edits, and his patter of editing is indeed <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Tendentious editing">tendentious</a>.

<p>I stepped over to the Kosovo article a long time ago, after one of the many calls for more uninvolved editors to help build consensus. IiF engages in some of the most obnoxious and obstructionist forms of the &#39;Civil POV Push&#39;, esp. the &#39;if consensus goes against me today, I can restart the discussion in two to three days and surely prevail&#39; tactic, wherein multiple similar ideas are presented serially in the hopes that eventually he&#39;ll bully, bulldoze, or bore people into letting something get by.

<p>It seems a great bit of confusion has persisted when it comes to the naming of the <a href="" title="Bagram Air Base">Bagram Air Base</a> article. Bagram Air Base (or as I&#39;ll refer to it from this point, Airfield) is an Army installation. Following military naming convention Army installations that involve aircraft movement are called Airfields. Airforce installations are called Air Bases (outside of the US) or Air Force Base (inside the US).</p>
<p>I have official websites supporting information referring to Bagram Airfield as the official name for the installation<a class="externallink" href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/">http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/</a></a><a class="externallink" href="http://www.bragg.army.mil/82dv/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bragg.army.mil/82dv/"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.bragg.army.mil/82dv/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bragg.army.mil/82dv/">http://www.bragg.army.mil/82dv/</a></a>. One of these is run by the <a href="" title="455 AEW">455 AEW</a> (USAF), the other is operated by the 82nd which is an Army outfit. </p>
<p>Some editors (mainly one specifically which I&#39;ll reference later) believe because &#34;Bagram Air Base&#34; has more hits on Google it qualifies it as the most common name for the installation. Being as I am deployed here I have yet to meet a person who considers it that name -- regardless if it is civilian or military. Furthermore, being as this is an Army installation, I would like to point out how many Army installations call themselves a base<a class="externallink" href="http://www.army.com/base_directory.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.army.com/base_directory.html"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.army.com/base_directory.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.army.com/base_directory.html">http://www.army.com/base_directory.html</a></a> (beyond FOB which is a generic term.) Bagram Airfield is even shortened to &#34;BAF&#34; by most personnel here. It is on walls, signs, and official leaderheads. Coins have it, medals, everything references it to Bagram Airfield. Why we&#39;re willing to use the wrong name because it might have more hits on Google compounds my confusion.</p>
<p>What I&#39;m finding out now after years of browsing and lightly editing Wikipedia is that misinformation seems OK if it is commonly considered that way. The article reads as if it is informing me that Bagram Airfield is actually called an Air Base. I know from experience as when I was leaving to come here I thought it was Bagram Air Base because of the article. This isn&#39;t the first confusing article though; NYT has it listed as &#34;Bagram Air Base&#34; too, which is a misconception. The misconception goes deep enough that some News websites refer to BAF as &#34;Bagram Air Force Base&#34;, or Bagram AFB. Entirely wrong and probably accidentally gathered due to finding incorrect references to the name.</p>
<p>Finally I feel an editor (<a href="" title="User:MickMacNee">User:MickMacNee</a>) here seems to spend more time arguing why something must be done in accordance with rules then for being factual. A quick poke around his <a href="" title="User talk:MickMacNee">User talk:MickMacNee</a> shows many people disagree with his demeanor and short sighted views on articles. If you take a look at the Talk page for the article in question MickMacNee has repeatedly ignored many other editors who support such a move to the point of almost being disrespectful. Even my edits to the article to specify that BAF is actually Bagram Airfield were reverted by the editor -- quoting another reference to a rule that is making this article inaccurate.</p>
<p>I simply feel that factual information must take precedence over naming; this being a very small naming issue but considerably important when conveying facts. I&#39;ll even reference <a href="" title="WP:Ignore_all_rules">WP:Ignore_all_rules</a> as a point here. Why should people be mislead into thinking BAF is actually Bagram Air Base when it can be as simple as a quick move and edit.</p>
<p>This almost makes me question how much is accurate on a Wikipedia article -- not because of vandalism; but rules or overzealous editors. I hope you, an Administrator, can understand and see the issue that others and myself see when it comes to this article. I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m wasting your time but I don&#39;t really see any other direction to take this. -<a href="" title="User:JE">JE</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User_talk:JE">Let&#39;s talk</a>) (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/JE">My contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 16:06, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Anybody who frequents ANI and is not on this daft <a href="" title="Wikipedia:The Great Wikipedia Dramaout">Drama Holiday</a> is as ever free to verify this user&#39;s claims for themselves, seeing as he has such a low opinion of me, because he seems to get enough free time from doing whatever he does in Bagram Air Base to keep bringing this up despite multiple explanations from multiple people. The recent revert he refers to was not to remove the official explanation, but to actualy restore the name used in the majority of the article to match the title, which has been the subject of three failed move requests so far, after he went so far as to not only change the name in the text, but to also to change the title of a reference, and to create an unnecessary article redirect. <a href="" title="User:MickMacNee">MickMacNee</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:MickMacNee">talk</a>) 16:24, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>I will quote myself here from <a href="#Requested_Move" title="Talk:Bagram_Air_Base">Talk:Bagram_Air_Base</a>: Articles are named by most common usage. That is why the article <a href="" title="Cat Stevens">Cat Stevens</a> is not called <b>Yusuf Islam</b> (which is his actual name) and why the article <a href="" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a> is not called <b>State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</b> (which is the State&#39;s official name). Read <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions">Wikipedia:Naming conventions</a> for more information.&#34; </p>
<p>Wikipedia standard is to go with the more commonly used title. While as recently as Nov 2008, &#34;Bagram Air Base&#34; was by far the more common of the two terms, today it has changed. A simple google search reveals this data: <a class="externallink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bagram+Air+Base%22+-wikipedia&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bagram+Air+Base%22+-wikipedia&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a">&#34;Bagram Air Base&#34; -wikipedia</a> = about 116,000; <a class="externallink" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;safe=off&#38;client=firefox-a&#38;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&#38;hs=v09&#38;q=%22Bagram+Air+Field%22+-wikipedia&#38;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;safe=off&#38;client=firefox-a&#38;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&#38;hs=v09&#38;q=%22Bagram+Air+Field%22+-wikipedia&#38;btnG=Search">&#34;Bagram Air Field&#34; -wikipedia</a> = about 882,000. Therefore, quite simply, the article now should be called <b>Bagram Air Field</b>. <a href="" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kingturtle">talk</a>) 20:25, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>So Google is the end-all and be-all of use for Wikipedia? Sergey Brin would be proud, I guess. Cat Stevens <b>was</b> Cat Stevens and famous as such long before he changed his name, so that logic doesn&#39;t apply: Bagram Air Field has always been Bagram Air Field. The Rhode Island example is so extreme as to be almost unique, so I can&#39;t see how it really applies, especially since &#34;Rhode Island&#34; is the short form of the official name, not, you know, <b>factually incorrect</b>.</dd></dl>

<dd>WP:IAR to deal with <b>reality</b> seems to apply -- especially since it&#39;s not even a goddamned rule in the first place, and being used to(rather petulantly) cling to a factually incorrect title. --<a href="" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:56, 19 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Speaking as someone knowledgeable, the proper name is indeed Bagram Air Field, a usage even <a href="" title="United States Air Forces Central">AFCENT</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/index.asp" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/index.asp">observes</a>.  Colloquial use of Bagram Air Base, including by reporters (and sometimes offhand by military personnel), simply reflects a commonplace lack of knowledge of the difference between an air field and an air base in US military parlance (or a failure to be precise).

<p>Ladies and Gentlemen,</p>
<p>As you may be aware, there is concern that the sitenotices regarding submission of candidacy for the Board of Trustees election were not seen anywhere but Meta after the 11th of this month.  Because of the potentially massive consequence of this, and to encourage a full and active election, the election committee has determined that:</p>
<pre>
-  Candidacies will be accepted through July 27th at 23:59 (UTC)

-  The period for questioning candidates begins immediately.  Candidates that are &#34;late to the party&#34; will, no doubt, be scrutinized by the community.  The Committee hopes that the community will work to actively ensure that all candidates receive equivalent questioning.

- The dates of election will not change.  The election will begin on 28 July and end on 10 August.
</pre>
<p>Please know that we recognize the radical nature of altering the schedule in the midst of the election and would not do it if we did not absolutely believe that there was a possibility that others may be interested and qualified and may not have known about the key dates.</p>

<p>  is an Albanian user which has strong views about <a href="" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>. Which is fine in itself, except that he tries to push his views by all means available, violating <a href="" title="WP:BATTLE">WP:BATTLE</a>, <a href="" title="WP:ARBMAC">WP:ARBMAC</a>, and a number of other policies such as <a href="" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. I&#39;m really surprised how he wasn&#39;t indefinitely (topic) banned so far. A few pieces of evidence follow; it&#39;s not difficult to find more just browsing through *all* his contribs:

<p>I propose a complete ban, or topic ban from Kosovo, Serbia and Albania-related articles. Since all his contributions are in this area, the difference between the two is purely nominal.

<dd>Another ridiculous attempt to silence me by a user who cannot use the talk pages to rebuttal. As soon as I start challenging the status-quo of articles which do not conform to the NPOV policy I have a case opened against me. But just like the past case <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive198#Topic_ban_proposal_for_Interestedinfairness.C2.A0.28talk.C2.A0.C2.B7_contribs.29" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Archive198#Topic_ban_proposal_for_Interestedinfairness.C2.A0.28talk.C2.A0.C2.B7_contribs.29">here</a> and the sock puppet investigation launched <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Interestedinfairness" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Interestedinfairness">here</a>, there is only a vendetta against me, no real evidence.

<dd>I feel I had to break a lance in favor of Int here:
<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t find a <a href="" title="WP:TE">WP:TE</a> on <a href="" title="Serbia">Serbia</a>: <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302130338" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302130338"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302130338" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302130338">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Serbia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=302130338</a></a> by Int. If it is stated that the Greeks colonized the southern area IV BC Romans north area II AD so natural question is what did they colonized?Were there any people etc  Everyone accepts the fact that Illyrians laid in Serb territory at that time and their history on that area, what kind of <a href="" title="WP:TE">WP:TE</a> is here?! Romans and Greeks are mentioned, but the Illyrians the people who really lived and inhabited the areas should not be mentioned?! And if they are mentioned this is tendentious?!Why?It is the opposite standing that could look tendentious. Everyone mentioned except Illyrians, the people who inhabited the area?! SO no <a href="" title="WP:TE">WP:TE</a> here.</li>
<li>As for the cn tags I agree that it is wrong to put them behind ref, but I must stress the fact that Int didn&#39;t remove anything from the text, he was pointing to the POV standing of the author(maybe in wrong way with his cn tags) and when he discussed in the talk page here <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#The_Ottoman_period" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#The_Ottoman_period"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#The_Ottoman_period" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#The_Ottoman_period">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Kosovo#The_Ottoman_period</a></a>  none tried to discuss according to <a href="" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> <a href="" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> <a href="" title="WP:R">WP:R</a> etc wiki rules, the result was a personal attack and a topic ban proposal.</li>
<li>For the previous accusations of sock and etc there has been much said before, Int wasn&#39;t guilty I don&#39;t know why it was brought up here again. <a href="" title="User:Aigest">Aigest</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Aigest">talk</a>) 08:41, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>IIF&#39;s persistent pushing of &#34;Kosovo is a country&#34; on <a href="" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic peoples</a> is disruptive and, in my view, tendentious. It illustrates a problem faced by any article whose scope includes the Balkans or any map covering that region: until the statehood of Kosovo is determined either at some binding international level or by en.wiki policy such articles can&#39;t do right for doing wrong. IIF accuses <a href="" title="Slavic people">Slavic people</a> of non-neutrality because it contains a map - intended to give readers a general geographical awareness of the distribution of Slavs at a resolution level limited to countries - which does not show Kosovo as separate from Serbia.  IIF is on a hiding to nothing trying to force such articles to change their depiction of Kosovo, because the Serbians will then be justified in jumping in and demanding a reversion.  IIF has ignored the substantive arguments made on the article&#39;s talk page and continued to push his own POV. Whatever sanction is applied must take into account not only articles related directly to Kosovo, but also the evidence of IIF&#39;s willingness to take his unproductive <a href="" title="WP:BATTLE">WP:BATTLEs</a> and <a href="" title="WP:SOAP">WP:SOAPboxes</a> to any other article with a tenuous link. -- <a href="" title="User:Timberframe">Timberframe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Timberframe">talk</a>) 09:40, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is no longer a simple dispute. The dispute was a couple of weeks ago. He couldn&#39;t accept that Wikipedia consensus was against his POV, and he went ahead with his POV pushing, on the Kosovo article, on many other articles related to Kosovo or Albanians. Let me explain it this way: let&#39;s say we all agree that the Alps are a mountain range, but one user simply doesn&#39;t and then keeps repeating it. This is pretty much what&#39;s happening here. Kosovo is a region, some see it as a province, some as a country, but Interestedinfairness wants it to be a country, even attempting to prove it&#39;s not a region or territory. ?!!. I don&#39;t even have the energy to repeat all the other Wikipedia rules he has broken, it&#39;s all on the Kosovo talk page, or on his talk page... Athenean&#39;s examples are proof enough, but there are MANY more examples of Interestedinfairness&#39; disruptive behavior, if you have the energy to look through his edits which are highly disruptive and this is making other constructive editors tired of arguing with this POV-pushing user over and over again. He had his chance, he had many chances, he blew them all. Enough. Simply enough. --<a href="" title="User:Cinéma C">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;<b><i>Cin</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:crimson&#34;&#62;<b>é</b>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;<b><i>ma</i></b> &#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:crimson&#34;&#62;<b><i>C</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> 18:07, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;m a previously uninvolved editor, who is even &#39;on his side&#39; (in as much as I support the independence of Kosovo), yet I still seem to be on the reciving end of this user. Two examples in the last couple of days seem indicative of the general manner in which IIF approaches these topics:</dd>
<dd>He placed a   tag on <a href="" title="Slavic peoples">Slavic peoples</a> - we eventually worked out that the sole reason was that one of the maps didn&#39;t show Kosovo as a disputed region. The map was so small you couldn&#39;t make it out, but cue <a href="#Neutrality_tag" title="Talk:Slavic_peoples">a large section of soapboxing, disrupting to make a point and some wikilawyering for good measure</a>. Even after being asked to get down from the Reichstag, he still continued trying to make some kind of point, and followed up with <a href="#Offend.3F" title="User_talk:Ninetyone">a snide comment on my talk page</a>. </dd>
<dd>In addition, a similar incident at <a href="#Neuatrality_tags" title="Talk:Kosovo">Talk:Kosovo</a> showed all the same hallmarks - disruption, attempts at wikilawyering etc. To conclude, taking into account his other contribs, IIF does not appear to be able to make wholly constructive edits, and his patter of editing is indeed <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Tendentious editing">tendentious</a>.

<p>I stepped over to the Kosovo article a long time ago, after one of the many calls for more uninvolved editors to help build consensus. IiF engages in some of the most obnoxious and obstructionist forms of the &#39;Civil POV Push&#39;, esp. the &#39;if consensus goes against me today, I can restart the discussion in two to three days and surely prevail&#39; tactic, wherein multiple similar ideas are presented serially in the hopes that eventually he&#39;ll bully, bulldoze, or bore people into letting something get by.

<dd>His explanation is available on the talk page.

<p>I don&#39;t think this is needed, but it does point out a logical fallacy of the way we handle things. We do treat calling some &#34;gay&#34; as a personal attack, but the only way it can be a personal attack is if you view being gay as a bad thing. In perfectly abstract logical terms, it&#39;s no more an attack than calling someone left-handed. In the real world, we judge it by the motivation of the speaker, and I think we get perfectly adequate results without new guidelines.&#38;mdash;<a href="" title="User:Kww">Kww</a>(<a href="" title="User talk:Kww">talk</a>) 13:34, 20 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Editors_Promoting_Somali_Towns">Editors Promoting Somali Towns</span></h2>

<p>I&#39;ve been having some trouble with editors who are putting things up to promote Somali towns (<a href="" title="Bu&#39;aale">Bu&#39;aale</a>, <a href="" title="Merca">Merca</a>) and relevant militant factions, and then putting them back up when I try to remove the advertising material. On his talk page, <a href="" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a>/<a href="" title="User:Disembrangler">Disembrangler</a> suggested that if the problem happen again I post something over here.</p>
<p>A particular editor copied back in the offending material to the <a href="" title="Bu&#39;aale">Bu&#39;aale</a> article, but without the inline flags, and then deleted my discussion page item on it. It is getting kind of old having to change things back with folks who wont go to discussion pages except to clear them out.

<dd>I try to watch over the Somali-related articles because the country is related to my area of focus (Ethiopia), but for the most part that topic area is a swamp needing a lot of work to bring up to standards. (Surf thru the articles in <a href="" title="Category: Somali clans">Category: Somali clans</a> sometime, &#38; see if you don&#39;t agree with me they share the worst features of the articles related to Micronations &#38; High schools.) Unfortunately, that amount of clean-up would require the full-time attention of at least one person, &#38; I have my hands full as it is. I can offer some pointers, but unless you want to take on this challenge, maybe the best solution would be to leave this subject area as clearly a mess in order to warn readers that the material is more unreliable than usual for Wikipedia. -- <a href="" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Llywrch">talk</a>) 18:18, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>I haven&#39;t followed the civility &#34;poll&#34;, is there an actual outcome?  If I had the time and energy, what I would do is this: Imagine we are all encyclopedia editors sitting around a conference table in an office building somewhere.  If the discussion between a couple people got too heated over some controversial point, the other people at the table might ask one or both of them to step outside until they calm down, so that the rest of the people could continue their business.  Have a cup of coffee, or a walk around the block, or play some foosball in the break room, whatever.  Then come back and rejoin the conversation with a cool head.  Applying this analogy, I would start liberally handing out 3 hour blocks to editors who can&#39;t treat each other with decency and respect, even when they disagree.  And I would keep it up for as long as it took to get the message across.  But, I fear such an approach would be much too controversial.  Better to let people treat each other like dirt, it seems. <a href="" title="User talk:Thatcher">Thatcher</a> 16:57, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>An actual outcome? There&#39;s a lot of material generated, and by scanning the topics and the volume of responses, you can get some ideas.

<dd>We come from very diverse backgrounds where standards of respect and professionalism can (perhaps unfortunately) vary significantly. (This would less likely to be an issue where people are usually interviewed or have some sort of check before they sit at the conference table - this doesn&#39;t happen here). Before a fair number of people are ready to ask them to leave (for even a short time), sometimes they&#39;d rather the person be shown ways to address the underlying problem, and that they be warned adequately. Just as blocks are used to prevent harm, even short blocks can have harmful effects on the individuals who can otherwise help make this encyclopedia what it is. Perhaps more thought and consideration to these factors would take care of the controversial elements. <a href="" title="User:Ncmvocalist">Ncmvocalist</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ncmvocalist">talk</a>) 17:22, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yes and no.  Many people would benefit from calm advice on how to edit collaboratively.  However, anyone capable of putting two fingers on a keyboard and editing should know that &#34;fuck off wanker&#34; is not an appropriate way to address a colleague.  Want one warning?  OK, one warning.  Then blocks until they get the message.  However, I don&#39;t want to be dragged out back and shot myself, so I&#39;ll leave this one alone.

<dd>I agree; there&#39;s no doubt about it in such a scenario. But controversy can come from a number of situations. For example, a lot of people advocate (or are under the impression) that the sole purpose of this encyclopedia is to &#34;make a free high quality encyclopedia&#34; (aka content contributions - some believe that such contributions are the <i>only</i> quality contributions that are made to wiki). Some such individuals also believe that the part about &#34;in a camraderie of mutual respect among contributors&#34; is not applicable (particularly to those who generate a lot of content contributions). Another example is where people do not care for civility if they don&#39;t treat words directed to them or said about them seriously (because we are merely online) - they are ready to be frank and dish it out because they expect others to be like them. Perceived or actual injustices can obviously also contribute to the problem. <a href="" title="User:Ncmvocalist">Ncmvocalist</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ncmvocalist">talk</a>) 18:01, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<p>What you fellows are ignoring is the incivility of posting harassing messages on an editor&#39;s talk page. Someone who keeps prank calling you (posting baiting, prodding and poking messages that don&#39;t have anything to do with article building) should fuck off. It&#39;s time the civility police stop dissecting every little word to make sure it&#39;s pleasant enough and start considering how editors actually behave towards one another. It&#39;s about respect. And the editor told to fuck off has continued to post baiting and unnecessary comments on an editor&#39;s talk page where it&#39;s quite clear they&#39;re not welcome. If the comments were critically important communciation related to encyclopedia building that would be one thing, but they&#39;re not.

<dd>I&#39;m not too surprised; you seem to be a reasonable person. I certainly don&#39;t think of you as &#34;bad&#34; or &#34;wrong&#34;. Perhaps that surprises you! &#60;p&#62; Do you feel I&#39;ve jumped down anyone&#39;s throat? I think I opened this thread pretty damn neutrally, and my feelings about WH stem from many incidents besides this one. One &#34;fuck off&#34; is nothing. An entrenched &#34;fuck off&#34; attitude is something completely different. I&#39;d like to address <b>both</b> behaviors, because jumping down the throat of the other guy reinforces WebHamsters immature, intemperate, unprofessional reaction. Nothing good can come of that approach, either. Both extremes suck. People sholdn&#39;t troll WebHamster. WebHamster should react less like bratty teenager who just learned to curse. &#60;p&#62; Now, lest we give the other guy a free pass, talk to me about the provocation. -<a href="" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a>&#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 18:56, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

However, I&#39;ve seen that he&#39;s had issues in the past, and when I think of chronically uncivil Wikipedians, I think of him. Anyone who is unable to maintain civility in the face of some baiting is not prepared to work here. There are people who work in very toxic settings, and never tell anyone to &#34;fuck off&#34;, nor say &#34;go away, there&#39;s a good chap&#34;.

<dd>(ec) I can agree that the behavior was not the best on <i>several</i> sides; but, I think it&#39;s rather hypocritical to suggest that just because one person acts improperly, that it&#39;s acceptable for another person to follow suit.  If you feel that WebHamster was &#34;baited&#34;, then it&#39;s open to <i>any</i> editor to offer advice or warnings.  Respect has to start somewhere, and sometimes it&#39;s best to start with the most offensive items first.   I don&#39;t think anyone is complaining about a little &#34;bluntness&#34; here.

<dd>You and several others have mischaracterised some of the points being made here as in some way &#34;excusing&#34; behaviour some may find unacceptable, or as a childish &#34;he started it&#34; kind of argument, but nothing could be further from the truth. GTBacchus&#39;s point above where he writes &#34;Anyone who is unable to maintain civility in the face of some baiting is not prepared to work here&#34; is a very good example of what&#39;s going wrong here. It&#39;s too difficult to tackle the problem at source, so let&#39;s give the trolls a get-out-of-jail-free card and go after their targets.

<dd>Is this where the misunderstanding is: If I say &#34;people should react better to trolling&#34;, it doesn&#39;t mean I condone trolling. Analogy: there are fires around, and we&#39;re firemen. Most of us use water, but a few seem to be using gasoline instead. If I ask that person to stop using gasoline, does that put me on the fire&#39;s side? My only point about incivility is that it&#39;s <i>stupid</i> because it makes situations worse. I don&#39;t care if you&#39;re civil; be smart. &#60;p&#62; I am 100% ready to go after the source, but it would help if people would stop pouring gas on the fires. It&#39;s triage: we have to stop them first. &#60;p&#62; Also, if someone baits, and someone else rises to it, <b>both</b> are at fault. If you say I&#39;m going after Peter and ignoring Paul, I say you&#39;re going after Paul and ignoring Peter.

<dd>Where&#39;s the personal attack? He didn&#39;t call him short or stupid. He made it absolutely 100% clear that he wasn&#39;t interested in further discussion on his talk page. Since the banter had little or nothing to do with article content building or collaboration, I don&#39;t see what the big deal is and It hink he was well within his rights to make his views known. We&#39;re here to build an encyclopedia, not to discuss how best to pleasant when some joker keeps popping up on an editor&#39;s talk page looking for trouble and trying to pick a fight.

<p>GTB I also agree with you, of course, so does everyone: It&#39;s obviously not okay to tell another editor to fuck off. It&#39;s also not okay to keep poking an editor with posts on their talk page and to keep bugging them when it&#39;s 100% totally clear that such banter is unwelcome. The appropriate Admin response would have been to ask the frustrated editor to please refrain from telling other editors to fuck off and to ask the other editor posting incessantly where they&#39;re not welcome to fuck off (buzz off? please move on? get a life?). That&#39;s it. After that it should be dropped and the unhappy editor&#39;s talk page left alone. There&#39;s no need to keep posting there and to keep discussing it ad nauseum. Move the fuck on. If we don&#39;t want editors to use foul language, then we need to actually show them some respect and restraint instead of continuing to poke them and acting surprised when they yell. The focus should always be on article content and collaboration. None of this has anything to do with article building, so it&#39;s disruptive. <a href="" title="User:ChildofMidnight">ChildofMidnight</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ChildofMidnight">talk</a>) 19:03, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>CoM, no. That&#39;s just the problem. It&#39;s not true that &#34;everyone&#34; agrees that it&#39;s not okay to tell another editor to fuck off. People are arguing that it <i>is</i> ok. Again, I don&#39;t give a shit about foul language here. I give a shit about collaboration (which WebHamster is on record as saying he&#39;s not here to participate in), and about how stupid, stupid behavior like his fucks up the atmosphere for collaboration. So does the stupid, stupid behavior of the person who was provoking him. Both parties acted like little bitty morons. That&#39;s a shame, because I&#39;d bet good money they&#39;re not morons at all, when you get right down to it. -<a href="" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a>&#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 19:11, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I challenge you to find anywhere that anyone has said it&#39;s &#34;okay&#34; to tell other editors to fuck off. What I believe has been said is that if an editor continues to post where they&#39;re not welcome they&#39;re likely to be told to fuck off. It&#39;s a subtle, but important difference. Rest assured that it&#39;s not okay to tell anyone to fuck off, but that such a reaction is to be expected when more subtle clues, like go away and please stop posting here are missed. <a href="" title="User:ChildofMidnight">ChildofMidnight</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ChildofMidnight">talk</a>) 19:21, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

Well, if someone can&#39;t see that telling anyone, anywhere, to &#34;Go fuck yourself&#34; is a personal attack - well, I&#39;m just not equipped to answer that.  It seems obvious to me.  You&#39;re &#34;real life&#34; analogy might have one other consequence as well, the person who punched someone, in many parts of the world, could be looking at legal ramifications for assault.  As I said, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s right &#34;troll&#34; or &#34;bait&#34; - but I think anyone who&#39;s got the tenure that WebHamster does, would be better served by pointing the editor to <a href="" title="WP:TROLL">WP:TROLL</a> and <a href="" title="WP:DENY">WP:DENY</a>. — &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #000000;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;&#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:Ched Davis">Ched</a>&#60;/b&#62; : <a href="" title="User_talk:Ched Davis">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#FFFFFF;background:#0000fa;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;?&#38;nbsp;&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 19:18, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>In a more perfect world admins would actually help resolve editing and content disputes. Imagine how much more would be accomplished if these arbiters of justice actually engaged in content building and article improvement instead of waiting around until an aggrevied party tells a troll to fuck off and then issuing a righteous block. The daft buggers also seem unable to grasp how uncivil it is to block someone with little or no effort to resolve the issues involved in a collegial way. The parochialism reminds me of the parent who smacks around their kids to teach them not to hit.

<dd>I agree with the general thrust of what I think you&#39;re saying, which is that more administrators ought to be working at the trenches, and sorting out problems as they see them arise, instead of sitting here waiting to pounce on every report of a naughty word being used. Naturally though I can&#39;t endorse your description of &#34;daft buggers&#34;. One of the blocks that &#34;gentleman&#34; so gleefully referred to above was for my suggestion that an unnamed editor was a &#34;sycophantic wannabee&#34;, so clearly I have to walk on eggshells around trigger-happy administrators. --<a href="" title="User:Malleus Fatuorum">Malleus</a> <a href="" title="User_talk:Malleus_Fatuorum">Fatuorum</a> 21:49, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>There&#39;s some serious distortion of the situation with WebHamster. His incivility is not confined to his Talk page.  After a  a Third Opinion was solicited (by moi), he commented on my &#34;stupid comments&#34; and &#34;inane questions&#34; and lack of &#34;a clue.&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-Americanism&#38;diff=301712271&#38;oldid=301708894" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-Americanism&#38;diff=301712271&#38;oldid=301708894"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-Americanism&#38;diff=301712271&#38;oldid=301708894" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-Americanism&#38;diff=301712271&#38;oldid=301708894">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAnti-Americanism&#38;diff=301712271&#38;oldid=301708894</a></a>. We were editing an article together, and the comments on his Talk page came from the need to work together. The idea that I shouldn&#39;t be posting on his Talk page neglects the fact that he is reverting edits on an article. The idea that he has been provoked by trolling is undocumented and laughable, unless you consider requests for civility to be trolling. The only comment I made that I consider provocative was about his &#34;Nero complex&#34;. This was after, oh, six or seven instances being insulted and told to fuck off. I find it incredibly bizarre that his repeated abuse is supposed to be partly excused by &#34;trolling,&#34; but my frustration isn&#39;t excused by being called stupid, inane, etc. over and over--while having my edit reverted.</p>
<p>WebHamster&#39;s incivility isn&#39;t a case of a reasonable person just losing his temper, or trolling. WebHamster has flatly stated that he has no commitment to civility:
&#34;So you have the choice of no expectation of civility or fucking off and doing what you came here for, ie editing an encyclopaedia.&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWebHamster&#38;diff=301833394&#38;oldid=301770076" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWebHamster&#38;diff=301833394&#38;oldid=301770076"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWebHamster&#38;diff=301833394&#38;oldid=301770076" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWebHamster&#38;diff=301833394&#38;oldid=301770076">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWebHamster&#38;diff=301833394&#38;oldid=301770076</a></a>
He has flatly stated that telling people to fuck off isn&#39;t a personal attack. He has flatly stated he is not going to respect Wikipedia&#39;s civility policy. As far as I can tell, admins don&#39;t care.

<ul>

<dd>Another point. I find myself feeling (maybe wrongly) entitled to edit-war, because of the lack of enforcement of the civility rules. Nobody deserves to be insulted. If trying to talk to WebHamster results in abuse, you are entitled to not talk to WebHamster.

Meanwhile, Malleus is now suggesting I can&#39;t read....incivility in a discussion on the importance of civility. Isn&#39;t that special? It&#39;s clear that civility isn&#39;t valued around here.

<dd>As you specifically request this, I will attempt to volunteer even more of my time to provide you with the diffs. you are requesting.  The issues of civility have indeed been discussed a great deal lately, GTB indeed started the entire thread with a link to the Poll in question.  While that poll has not been closed at this point, and no clearly defined &#34;consensus&#34; has been stated by any person who will be closing the poll, I believe that it is apparent that there are a wide range of views on this topic.  Personally, I try to adhere to the <a href="" title="WP:CIV">WP:CIV</a> guideline to the best of my abilities, and I would hope that others would do the same.  Like Thatcher, I am not eager to be taken out back and shot either; however, when I see something that I believe to be a violation of <a href="" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a> policy - I intend to warn first, and block second.  My efforts will be geared at minimizing disruption in regards to those &#34;adminy&#34; actions.  Getting back to the direct topic of this thread: I believe that there is enough support here that &#34;fuck off troll&#34;, and &#34;go fuck yourself&#34;  are unacceptable personal attacks.  Two wrongs do not make a right, but there is also evidence here that suggests that &#34;baiting&#34;, &#34;trolling&#34;, &#34;harassment&#34;, and &#34;badgering&#34; need to be addressed as well.  At least that is my understanding at the moment.  Hopefully all those who have shown an interest in this thread, will not attempt to say <a href="" title="WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT">WP:IDIDNTHEARTHAT</a>.  As I also have a life outside of WP, it may take a day or two to provide the specific &#34;examples&#34; that you are requesting; but I will attempt to do so when time permits. — &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #000000;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;&#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:Ched Davis">Ched</a>&#60;/b&#62; : <a href="" title="User_talk:Ched Davis">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#FFFFFF;background:#0000fa;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;?&#38;nbsp;&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 16:39, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>One point that should be mentioned here is that far too many people seem to think that the banhammer solves all behavior problems, either big or small. Is someone being abusive? Toss a 24-block at them. Someone said &#34;fuck you&#34;? Block them for a week. All of that is just another facet of the problem behind the rule about <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Don&#39;t template the regulars">templating the regulars</a> -- there are always more reasons to do someting than simple malice. What I believe should be done instead is to first <i>ask that person why they are acting that way</i>, especially if they&#39;re an established editor who has otherwise demonstrated good judgment. Take, for example, that <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=291466598" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bishonen&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=291466598">other infamous incident</a>: had someone intervened by talking to the (admittedly) incivil party, &#38; explained things, maybe an apology would have been forthcoming &#38; the individuals involved would have worked things out &#38; moved past the incident. Instead, without warning the incivil party was struck by the banhammer, &#38; has now effectively left Wikipedia, while the other party not only feels that their problem has not been resolved but has been treated unfairly for acting in good faith. Yes, approaching problems in this way is far more time-consuming, but it&#39;s something all of us -- including me -- can start implementing without waiting for some group of Wikipedians to formulate their own solution, &#38; continue to do so even if we do. -- <a href="" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Llywrch">talk</a>) 20:28, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Saying the rules should be enforced isn&#39;t the same as saying &#34;the banhammer solves all behavior problems.&#34; Do you think all laws should be ignored, because, hey, even when enforced people still break laws? Why use the &#34;banhammer&#34; on vandals? Edit warring? A wiki is collaboration, period. There is no collaboration where there are insults and abuse, period.  As for asking WebHamster &#34;why are you acting that way,&#34; it was done and his response was that he doesn&#39;t give a &#34;fuck&#34; about civility. Now what?

<dd>Have u looked at that article? It&#39;s been stripped down to almost nothing. Also I havn&#39;t read the full (very very very very long) discussion but what I have read on it shows conflicting views of verifiability and ignore all rules, what in the opinion of all u admins would be correct to do in that case? The article for it on Wikifur is significantly better and is similar to older versions of the wikipedia article. Basically I&#39;m saying that reducing over 11,000 bytes to over 2,000 looks very much like vandalism, which a huge discussion hasn&#39;t been able to undo.  I was hoping to get an actual verdict about whether to add back in all that removed content.

<p>Any uninvolved administrator may utilize discretionary sanctions, including topic bans and blocks, to enforce this probation. Acting administrators are encouraged to apply sanctions tailored to the circumstances and context. For the purposes of enforcing this measure, any administrator approached directly by Ryulong for enforcement should not act directly. In such a situation, raise both Ryulong&#39;s and Mythdon&#39;s conduct in normal venues for review.  &#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>

<p>Hi, a few weeks ago, <a href="" title="User:PMDrive1061">User:PMDrive1061</a> mistakenly fully protected several articles when he meant to semi-protect them.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Calling_valid_edits_vandalism">Calling valid edits vandalism</span></h2>

<p>An administrator from another wikiproject has reverted my edits a number of times, labeling them as <a href="" title="WP:vandalism">vandalism</a> when they were not. See <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Krste_Misirkov&#38;action=history" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Krste_Misirkov&#38;action=history">the history of the page</a>. We&#39;re having a dispute on the intro of the article, in which I&#39;m trying to follow the <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (Macedonia-related articles)">Manual of style</a> (but that&#39;s another question, irrelevant to the topic). On the talkpage he called my edits <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKrste_Misirkov&#38;diff=303214222&#38;oldid=303150846" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AKrste_Misirkov&#38;diff=303214222&#38;oldid=303150846">vandalism</a>, which is clearly not the case. I asked him not to do so since he&#39;s an admin and should know the rules. The answer was another revert with the edit-summary of <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Krste_Misirkov&#38;diff=303340261&#38;oldid=303315465" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Krste_Misirkov&#38;diff=303340261&#38;oldid=303315465">Do not vandalize anymore</a>. I decided to post an ANI since he has a history of off-wiki stalking me (including e-mail and skype harassment) and all the personal and racist attacks me and fellow editors have had from him plus the fact that he&#39;s an admin and should be aware of the rules of the community. --<b><a href="" title="User:Laveol">&#60;font color=&#34;#007700&#34;&#62;L&#60;font color=&#34;#009900&#34;&#62;a&#60;font color=&#34;#00aa00&#34;&#62;v&#60;font color=&#34;#00cc00&#34;&#62;e&#60;/font&#62;o&#60;/font&#62;l&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Laveol">T</a>&#60;/sup&#62;</b> 15:11, 21 July 2009 (UTC)

Further no where is one required to explain where a non-free image can be found nor is one required to provide one.

<dd>Stolen as in randomly downloaded from site. Considering Europe&#39;s stricter copyright violations, I&#39;d be curious as to whether that is still a valid fair use. In either case, we&#39;re far off topic at this point. The basic issue was the reverting. Per what I was told by an administrator, the image uploader cannot and should not remove the tag. If they dispute, fine, add the reason why in the template as the template instructions, and wait for an administrator to review. The tag was added in good faith as anyone can see from the discussion I&#39;ve already linked to and its removal by the uploader was inappropriate (same as removing a CSD tag). Carmouche&#39;s popping in to get involved and his posting here does nothing but inflame the issue. He&#39;d already posted his disagreement on the image, and all that remained was admin review. -- <a href="" title="User:AnmaFinotera">&#60;span style=&#39;font-family: &#34;Comic Sans MS&#34;; color:#5342FF&#39;&#62;AnmaFinotera&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;(<a href="" title="User talk:AnmaFinotera">talk</a>&#38;nbsp;<b>·</b> <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/AnmaFinotera">contribs</a>) 16:34, 20 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Commons_Helper_.28Feb_2009_malfunction.29">Commons Helper (Feb 2009 malfunction)</span></h2>

<p>As explained on a page at Commons, <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/User:Para/CommonsHelper">Commons:User:Para/CommonsHelper</a>
at some point in February 2009, Commons helper managed to corrupt Image descriptions
obtained from Wikipedia projects.</p>
<p>Although some of the information can be recovered from the edit summary recorded 
as part of the transfer in some places this does not exist.</p>
<p>As a number of these images might now be deleted locally, it requires administrator
effort to assist in finding and patching the description information on commons.</p>
<p>Another related issue is that at some points Commons Helper appears to have
had some issues with accented characters.</p>

<li>In general, leave the talk pages alone as a deletion matter.  There is no valid speedy deletion criterion under which those talk pages are being tagged, note, so the correct course is to remove the invalid notices.  Redirection <i>does not involve deletion</i>, for article or for talk page.&#60;p&#62;There&#39;s nothing <i>gained</i> by deleting the talk pages, after all.  Doing so is just an unnecessary addition to the database size, and an unnecessary loss to the editors who might have discussed the redirect on its talk page, or might be informed by seeing such past talk page discussions by others.  Redirects are cheap, and so are their talk pages.  <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 01:04, 21 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<p> 
 
It seems a great bit of confusion has persisted when it comes to the naming of the <a href="" title="Bagram Air Base">Bagram Air Base</a> article. Bagram Air Base (or as I&#39;ll refer to it from this point, Airfield) is an Army installation. Following military naming convention Army installations that involve aircraft movement are called Airfields. Airforce installations are called Air Bases (outside of the US) or Air Force Base (inside the US).</p>
<p>I have official websites supporting information referring to Bagram Airfield as the official name for the installation<a class="externallink" href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/">http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/</a></a><a class="externallink" href="http://www.bragg.army.mil/82dv/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bragg.army.mil/82dv/"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.bragg.army.mil/82dv/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bragg.army.mil/82dv/">http://www.bragg.army.mil/82dv/</a></a>. One of these is run by the <a href="" title="455 AEW">455 AEW</a> (USAF), the other is operated by the 82nd which is an Army outfit. </p>
<p>Some editors (mainly one specifically which I&#39;ll reference later) believe because &#34;Bagram Air Base&#34; has more hits on Google it qualifies it as the most common name for the installation. Being as I am deployed here I have yet to meet a person who considers it that name -- regardless if it is civilian or military. Furthermore, being as this is an Army installation, I would like to point out how many Army installations call themselves a base<a class="externallink" href="http://www.army.com/base_directory.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.army.com/base_directory.html"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.army.com/base_directory.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.army.com/base_directory.html">http://www.army.com/base_directory.html</a></a> (beyond FOB which is a generic term.) Bagram Airfield is even shortened to &#34;BAF&#34; by most personnel here. It is on walls, signs, and official leaderheads. Coins have it, medals, everything references it to Bagram Airfield. Why we&#39;re willing to use the wrong name because it might have more hits on Google compounds my confusion.</p>
<p>What I&#39;m finding out now after years of browsing and lightly editing Wikipedia is that misinformation seems OK if it is commonly considered that way. The article reads as if it is informing me that Bagram Airfield is actually called an Air Base. I know from experience as when I was leaving to come here I thought it was Bagram Air Base because of the article. This isn&#39;t the first confusing article though; NYT has it listed as &#34;Bagram Air Base&#34; too, which is a misconception. The misconception goes deep enough that some News websites refer to BAF as &#34;Bagram Air Force Base&#34;, or Bagram AFB. Entirely wrong and probably accidentally gathered due to finding incorrect references to the name.</p>
<p>Finally I feel an editor (<a href="" title="User:MickMacNee">User:MickMacNee</a>) here seems to spend more time arguing why something must be done in accordance with rules then for being factual. A quick poke around his <a href="" title="User talk:MickMacNee">User talk:MickMacNee</a> shows many people disagree with his demeanor and short sighted views on articles. If you take a look at the Talk page for the article in question MickMacNee has repeatedly ignored many other editors who support such a move to the point of almost being disrespectful. Even my edits to the article to specify that BAF is actually Bagram Airfield were reverted by the editor -- quoting another reference to a rule that is making this article inaccurate.</p>
<p>I simply feel that factual information must take precedence over naming; this being a very small naming issue but considerably important when conveying facts. I&#39;ll even reference <a href="" title="WP:Ignore_all_rules">WP:Ignore_all_rules</a> as a point here. Why should people be mislead into thinking BAF is actually Bagram Air Base when it can be as simple as a quick move and edit.</p>
<p>This almost makes me question how much is accurate on a Wikipedia article -- not because of vandalism; but rules or overzealous editors. I hope you, an Administrator, can understand and see the issue that others and myself see when it comes to this article. I&#39;m sorry if I&#39;m wasting your time but I don&#39;t really see any other direction to take this. -<a href="" title="User:JE">JE</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User_talk:JE">Let&#39;s talk</a>) (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/JE">My contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 16:06, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

The recent revert he refers to was not to remove the official explanation, but to actualy restore the name used in the majority of the article to match the title, which has been the subject of three failed move requests so far, after he went so far as to not only change the name in the text, but to also to change the title of a reference, and to create an unnecessary article redirect. <a href="" title="User:MickMacNee">MickMacNee</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:MickMacNee">talk</a>) 16:24, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>I will quote myself here from <a href="#Requested_Move" title="Talk:Bagram_Air_Base">Talk:Bagram_Air_Base</a>: Articles are named by most common usage. That is why the article <a href="" title="Cat Stevens">Cat Stevens</a> is not called <b>Yusuf Islam</b> (which is his actual name) and why the article <a href="" title="Rhode Island">Rhode Island</a> is not called <b>State of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations</b> (which is the State&#39;s official name).

<p>Wikipedia standard is to go with the more commonly used title. While as recently as Nov 2008, &#34;Bagram Air Base&#34; was by far the more common of the two terms, today it has changed. A simple google search reveals this data: <a class="externallink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bagram+Air+Base%22+-wikipedia&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Bagram+Air+Base%22+-wikipedia&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a">&#34;Bagram Air Base&#34; -wikipedia</a> = about 116,000; <a class="externallink" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;safe=off&#38;client=firefox-a&#38;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&#38;hs=v09&#38;q=%22Bagram+Air+Field%22+-wikipedia&#38;btnG=Search" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;safe=off&#38;client=firefox-a&#38;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&#38;hs=v09&#38;q=%22Bagram+Air+Field%22+-wikipedia&#38;btnG=Search">&#34;Bagram Air Field&#34; -wikipedia</a> = about 882,000.

<dd>So Google is the end-all and be-all of use for Wikipedia? Sergey Brin would be proud, I guess. Cat Stevens <b>was</b> Cat Stevens and famous as such long before he changed his name, so that logic doesn&#39;t apply: Bagram Air Field has always been Bagram Air Field. The Rhode Island example is so extreme as to be almost unique, so I can&#39;t see how it really applies, especially since &#34;Rhode Island&#34; is the short form of the official name, not, you know, <b>factually incorrect</b>.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>WP:IAR to deal with <b>reality</b> seems to apply -- especially since it&#39;s not even a goddamned rule in the first place, and being used to(rather petulantly) cling to a factually incorrect title. --<a href="" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 02:56, 19 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Speaking as someone knowledgeable, the proper name is indeed Bagram Air Field, a usage even <a href="" title="United States Air Forces Central">AFCENT</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/index.asp" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bagram.afcent.af.mil/index.asp">observes</a>.  Colloquial use of Bagram Air Base, including by reporters (and sometimes offhand by military personnel), simply reflects a commonplace lack of knowledge of the difference between an air field and an air base in US military parlance (or a failure to be precise).  That said, this debate is more a matter for an RfC than AN/I. <a href="" title="User:Askari Mark">Askari Mark</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Askari Mark">(Talk)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 20:48, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The name was Air Base when I arrived, I told it how it was in the three failed move requests, and all I have done is maintain the article per the Maual of Style, unless or until the title gets changed by consensus.

<dd>Well, let&#39;s see, the place is actually named Bagram Air Field (as the article acknowledges), the USAF calls it that (instead of Bagram Air Base), all the official documentation calls it that, and Kingturtle showed above that googling (outside of Wikipedia) turns up the correct name over 7.6 times as often as the incorrect name ... so what&#39;s to &#34;buy&#34;?  Why the passionate insistence on keeping the article at the wrong name?

<p>I&#39;m pulling this out of archive as it was never resolved. Ultimately I&#39;m not concerned about MickMacNee&#39;s editing behavior in the article but more the naming of the article to match with the installation / factual name, not the misconception of the name. With the support and information above I&#39;m hopeful the article name would be changed as result of this discussion. -<a href="" title="User:JE">JE</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User_talk:JE">Let&#39;s talk</a>) (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/JE">My contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 03:33, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p> </p>
<p>Igor emailed me with an unblock request earlier today, and since I&#39;m not here anymore, I suggested the   template approach. Since this probably counts as one of the &#34;unresolved issues&#34; I mentioned on my talk page, I&#39;ll unretire in order to comment. I&#39;d be inclined to unblock. I&#39;m cautiously hopeful that nothing like his previous problems are going to return. The following disorganized points may (or may not) be useful:
</p>
<ul>
<li>He and I never got around to the mentorship. At the time, Igor said he didn&#39;t feel a need to rush back to Wikipedia (which I took as a good sign) and wanted to wait, I said I would be happy to wait for him to start it up, but heard nothing. Eventually I retired. </li>
<li>We did, for some months, exchange occasional emails about miscellanea, much of it Wikipedia related. He didn&#39;t exhibit any of the combativeness that marked his last few days of editing here.</li>
<li>I seem to recall in the first few weeks someone saying on his talk page that this delay meant that he had &#34;refused&#34; mentorship, or that he was refusing to do things I was suggesting he do.  That is not the case.</li>
<li>Someone should dig up the old AN or ANI thread and look at the external sites mentioned, and see if the attacks were taken down. I seem to recall they were, but haven&#39;t looked in ages.</li>
<li>90% of the problem, I think, was Igor going into bunker-mentality mode, and acting as if anyone who criticized him was &#34;out to get him&#34;, and an enemy to be vanquished. I think a lot of it was editing under the influence of adrenaline, and being unable to drop things and move on.  A year&#39;s break seems likely to have cured that.</li>
<li>I note that, for (I think) the first time ever, he&#39;s admitted his previous behavior was disruptive.</li>
<li>I&#39;m pretty sure he hasn&#39;t been socking (at least until February, when I stopped keeping an eye out. No way to guarantee, of course, but for one thing I don&#39;t think he&#39;d be any good at it, and would have been found out), which bodes well.</li>
<li>While I&#39;m not sure it should be a condition for an unblock, I strongly urge Igor to find an established editor as a mentor, and promise to check in with the mentor for advice if he starts feeling stressed, or if people begin to complain about his behavior. I think this is better than some kind of pre-unblock mentoring.</li></ul>

<p>In short, why not? We&#39;ve given much more disruptive people another chance, even when they&#39;d been socking to evade their ban. Easy to reblock if problems recur, and we&#39;ve gained an editor if they don&#39;t. If the unblock does go through, Just relax and take it easy, OK Igor? --<a href="" title="User:Barneca">barneca (ret.)</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Barneca">talk</a>) 15:58, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m a fan of 2nd chances, so if there&#39;s no objections raised in the next little while, I will unblock based on barneca&#39;s assessment of the situation. –&#60;font face=&#34;verdana&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="user:xeno"><b>xeno</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34; face=&#34;verdana&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 16:18, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>I remember him from last time round and he was an absolute pain and seems completely oblivious to this. I kinda got the impression that he was either completely incapable of change or playing around with some breaching experiment of some kind. I&#39;m very cautious of an unblock since neither of the factors bodes well for his future editing. I&#39;d only be inclined to endorse an unblock if there was a clear plan to manage his behaviour and perhaps some indications that his return was going to add some value on the content side. Otherwise it might be a case of just adding to the drama round here. Wikipedia already has enough editors who wilfully don&#39;t get it and who are unnecessarily disruptive as a result. <a href="" title="User:Spartaz">Spartaz</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Spartaz">Humbug!</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 16:42, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>


<ul>
<li>I would support the unblock as any disruption can be quickly and easily mitigated by a reinstatement of the indef block. In cases like this one does not have to go through the full set of warnings and dozens of paragraphs of discussion before blocking the user as one has to with a new user (or as seems to be the case with disruptive users, whether or not one has to), so any drama which might be caused by unblocking this user can be immediately eliminated by re-blocking on the first offense. &#60;font color=&#34;forestgreen&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Theseeker4"><b>The</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Theseeker4">&#60;font color=&#34;#0000C0&#34;&#62;<b>Seeker&#38;nbsp;4</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Theseeker4">&#60;font color=&#34;#CC7722&#34; face=&#34;Papyrus&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/font&#62;</a> 18:18, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>


<ul>
<li>As the blocking admin I will/have sent a few other messages to persons closely involved in the original block for their consideration of the matter also.  I will also consider this matter and make my own view on unblocking known sometime later today (after I get through a few RL issues).--<a href="" title="User:VirtualSteve">&#60;strong&#62;VS&#60;/strong&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 22:11, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>I do not have a final view on this as yet but I wonder what others think about sites such as <a class="externallink" href="http://www.londonfetishscene.com/wipi/index.php?title=User%3AIgorberger&#38;diff=14881&#38;oldid=14880#About_My_World" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.londonfetishscene.com/wipi/index.php?title=User%3AIgorberger&#38;diff=14881&#38;oldid=14880#About_My_World">this one which reinforces the troll theme</a> and details that his contributions to <i>WipiPedia</i> include being a &#60;u&#62;wikipedia stalker&#60;/u&#62; - and a comment <i>You fuck with me, I will Troll you for life!</i>.  Whilst I appreciate they are off-wiki sites they are the same sites that were listed and argued about during the last ANI diffed by xeno above, and link to another lengthy AN discussion <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive382#User:Igorberger" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive382#User:Igorberger">here one month earlier</a> and they are still maintained by Igor.  Given that Igorberger did not finalise his mentorship with Barneca and we have nothing but his relative silence over the past year (he has edited slightly at his talk page from time to time) our question should be is there enough here to see Igor unblocked or should he still go through a mentorship program as concluded at the last ANI, and offered by Barneca but not finalised by Igor?--<a href="" title="User:VirtualSteve">&#60;strong&#62;VS&#60;/strong&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 23:24, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>I am not currently very active in editing Wikipedia, but did have some communication with user:Igor Berger at the time of blocking about a year ago. I would think that as a general rule, we would give a second chance to any user who has the intention of contributing to this project in a positive way. That would seem to apply here. Although there is no indication that the user has any special area of expertise, they did seem to wish for positive things, although there was a tendency to go overboard with opposition to perceived problems. I hope that is no longer the case. </p>
<p>I am not in a position to examine the material from other sites which might have the effect of raising doubts about this user; regarding such material, I wonder if there has been any recent or current activity there which is questionable, or whether there is only the old stuff there. </p>
<p>If there is a question of specific offence being given to any particular user, then I feel that user:Igor Berger ought to address that matter in a courteous way. If there is no current problem there then, as I said, I would be inclined to extend our customary second chance in this case, and hope that user:Igor Berger is in a position to appreciate such consideration and act accordingly.

<ul>
<li>How about giving Igor a chance to copy an article to his userspace and work on it there.  If he demonstrates the ability to contribute productively, he could be allowed to edit freely subject to a condition that he may be blocked indefinitely by any uninvolved administrator if he returns to prior disruptive style editing. <a href="" title="User:Jehochman">Jehochman</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Jehochman">Talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 02:55, 23 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Whilst I still have concerns that Igor will return to disruptive editing at places like ANI etc I do agree with and support Jonathan&#39;s suggestion above - although I would suggest a time frame of say a few weeks of editing at his userspace is set at first as this would allow him to interact with others who came to his userspace to copy edit, assist etc with the article he was working on.  Perhaps if Igor indicated at his talk page now what article (new?) he would like to work on then Xeno can act as they see fit given that they are considering the unblock request.--<a href="" title="User:VirtualSteve">&#60;strong&#62;VS&#60;/strong&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:VirtualSteve">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 03:05, 23 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>


<ul>
<li>VS pointed me to this discussion. I think a year is quite a lot of opportunity to mature and reflect on things, so I&#39;d have no problem with Igor getting another chance. &#60;u&#62;However&#60;/u&#62; I&#39;d like to see a mentor per Barneca and some indication of his intetion to work on <i>content</i> per Spartaz. And I hope we don&#39;t see anything more about &#34;<a href="" title="Wikipedia:Miscellany for deletion/Wikipedia:Social engineering Internet">Social engineering internet</a>&#34; and the somewhat COI interest in articles about various malwares (if I recall correctly). As far as external sites, if it doesn&#39;t spill over to en:wiki, I don&#39;t really care. You can have a site advocating poison gas attacks on whales and pandas for all I care, so long as you&#39;re making good edits to our articles on flowers and bumblebees. I&#39;m not too enthused about JEH&#39;s idea though, little edits may be a better way to start over, rather than trying something overly ambitious. If there&#39;s a willing mentor, I say go for it. <a href="" title="User:Franamax">Franamax</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Franamax">talk</a>) 03:06, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

The unblocking admin can set the quantity xx, and I would suggest a further condition that Igor and I reach a satisfactory mentoring arrangement, and that consensus for a full unblock is reached here. I&#39;m willing to give it a shot, but the first step will be to give Igorberger further access to their userspace.

<p>In reading the consensus at <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Advisory Council on Project Development">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Advisory Council on Project Development</a>, it seems clear that users are generally in favour of <i>some sort</i> of focus group to examine issues facing Wikipedia and propose solutions, and are generally against this focus group being invite-only and/or appointed by ArbCom. To make any COI I have here clear: I agree such a group is needed (obviously), I do not agree that it shouldn&#39;t necessarily be appointed by ArbCom, I had put my name forward to ArbCom as a selfnom after the announcement, and in deference to community consensus I would not now accept such an appointment in the incredibly remote chance it were to be offered.</p>

I know it&#39;s short notice, but I haven&#39;t found that magic page that explains everything yet, so I figured I would ask for help. <b><a href="" title="User:MBisanz">&#60;span style=&#39;color: #FFFF00;background-color: #0000FF;&#39;&#62;MBisanz&#60;/span&#62;</a></b> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:MBisanz">&#60;span style=&#39;color: #FFA500;&#39;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 02:32, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>Hello. I am currently engaged in a dispute with   at <a href="" title="Talk:Clarence Thomas">Talk:Clarence Thomas</a>. I won&#39;t belabor it; you can read it there, but long story short: Simon accused me of violating <a href="" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. I disagreed. It went to the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard&#38;oldid=303463101#Clarence_Thomas" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Biographies_of_living_persons/Noticeboard&#38;oldid=303463101#Clarence_Thomas">BLP noticeboard</a>, in what I considered a somewhat inconclusive thread. Simon chose <a href="" title="User:Noroton">a contributor to the thread who agreed with him</a> and pronounced the matter <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AClarence_Thomas&#38;diff=303324001&#38;oldid=303209244" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AClarence_Thomas&#38;diff=303324001&#38;oldid=303209244">&#34;settled&#34;</a> by his comments.

<dd>This is one of the worst pages to post a request for cool heads. This is not the place to post a request for participation in a content dispute. We have the Village Pump and probably more than one WikiProject talk page for that, and <a href="" title="WP:CANVASS">WP:CANVASS</a> also gives you some leeway in contacting others. This is the place for some editor who was slyly trying to get hotheads who are on that editor&#39;s side to get the consensus that editor doesn&#39;t yet have, so (without assuming bad faith of someone I respect) it does Wikipedia no good, nor your reputation, MastCell, to post this kind of message at this spot. I suggested yesterday that you take a little time to think about just what it is that you&#39;re trying so hard to get in the article: You want to quote an ostensibly neutral report/analysis that calls a U.S. Supreme Court justice someone who is &#34;far right&#34; on the court. You&#39;re not asking that someone&#39;s opinion that he&#39;s &#34;far right&#34; be mentioned, but that Wikipedia cite that statement the same way we would cite any neutral report, and you want an extensive quote. To oversimplify just a bit, you want Wikipedia&#39;s endorsement of the idea that Thomas is &#34;far right&#34;. And you want that without having proven that this is the kind of description that neutral sources would commonly use, when in fact they wouldn&#39;t. </dd>
<dd>That is not what Wikipedia was set up to do. </dd>
<dd>Nor was Wikipedia set up to be a forum for ideological battling and political maneuvering over sensitive, controversial topics. </dd>
<dd>There is an open discussion at <a href="#Clarence_Thomas" title="WP:BLPN">WP:BLPN</a> where I have made several points and asked you to consider them carefully. Now that 24 hours and more have passed, and you still haven&#39;t addressed those points, I suggest you re-engage in that discussion, regardless of the Mediation case. <a href="" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a> urges reasonable discussion, tending toward compromise, as the way to make content decisions.</dd>
<dd>That&#39;s what Wikipedia was set up to do.</dd>

<dd>It&#39;s a request to help defuse a conflict which I feel has become overly heated, and where various behavioral policies are being edged up against or violated. I don&#39;t see how appealing for help in defusing a dispute, in an open and non-partisan venue, constitutes some sort of abuse. If people feel this is a simple content dispute and want to direct me elsewhere, that&#39;s fine. I responded to your arguments at length on <a href="" title="WP:BLP/N">WP:BLP/N</a>; I felt we&#39;d reached the point where we were both restating our premises without convincing the other; so I made a <i>conscious</i> decision not to keep beating the horse, but to step back in hopes that some additional outside input would be forthcoming.&#60;p&#62;I will not litigate the content issue here. I think you&#39;re greivously misrepresenting both the content and the sourcing of my proposed edits, but that&#39;s an issue for the talk page. Neither will I participate in the edit war Simon has promised - I decided a little while ago to self-impose 1RR, at most, on the article for my own sanity. Nor do I think a mediation request - or <i>any</i> discussion - premised on the idea that <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2009-07-20/Clarence_Thomas&#38;oldid=303448048" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Mediation_Cabal/Cases/2009-07-20/Clarence_Thomas&#38;oldid=303448048">I&#39;m a biased ideologue bent at any cost on defaming a person I detest</a>, and demanding a topic ban as the outcome of &#34;mediation&#34; - is worth my time. So I&#39;m looking for other ways forward. I&#39;m talking about the fact that things have devolved and personal attacks and accusations of malice are blocking the way forward, and I&#39;m asking for help. I would certainly welcome additional input at the <a href="" title="WP:BLP/N">WP:BLP/N</a> thread as well. <b><a href="" title="User:MastCell">MastCell</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User Talk:MastCell">Talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 05:34, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>If diffusing the situation and improving the article is your goal, the most direct, efficient way of achieving it would be to broaden the discussion to include closely related areas where your position is stronger, achieve some good will with those you disagree with and then suggest alternatives that achieve your legitimate, broader goal of presenting an accurate picture of where Thomas stands ideologically on the court. Offer alternative sourcing and wording that amounts to a win-win. That can be done without including one particular sentence that offends both me and the other editor, and by obstinantly clinging to that one sentence, you are the one raising the heat and dimming the light. Because you&#39;re clinging to something offensive, and without a believable justification, you&#39;re hurting your own credibility with the other editor and me, and that&#39;s why he brought you to mediation. You say you want to settle this on the talk page, but it&#39;s your insistance on this point, which should be insignificant to your side (you haven&#39;t shown why it should even be important to you), that has brought the matter to BLPN, Mediation and now here. Really, you and everybody else knows that when something your doing doesn&#39;t matter much to you but offends others (and its offensiveness has been explained reasonably and at length) that the best thing to do is to give in on the small point as you try to succeed on larger points. I think it should be clear to anyone that a Wikipedia-endorsed statement that Thomas is &#34;far right&#34; is offensive to a number of editors and should not be part of a consensus result. You could make a good case that parts of that article are too favorable to Thomas. So please change your approach so that this doesn&#39;t have to bother other editors at so many different forums. -- <a href="" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Noroton">talk</a>) 12:00, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>The dispute arises from Mastcell&#39;s insistence that the description &#34;far right&#34; stay in a BLP about someone who isn&#39;t on the <a href="" title="far right">far right</a>, and that it be presented (as Noroton notes) as neutral analysis rather than opinion. He has rebuffed all attempts to compromise and ignored all attempts to explain to him the BLP problems inherent in using so inflammatory a term, especially when it&#39;s unnecessary and inaccurate. </p>
<p>That&#39;s the story so far. This chapter opens with this AN posting by Mastcell. It is forum shopping, and should not be entertained. After his position was rejected at the BLP noticeboard, Mastcell continued to revert any attempt to remove the disputed material, whether by outright exclusion or by finding alternative sources that made a nearly identical points without the &#34;far right&#34; language. His claim to want &#34;more eyes on this situation&#34; is thus posture rather than reality: more eyes have <i>already</i> looked at this situation, through BLPN. He didn&#39;t like and thus ignored the result.</p>
<p>I then filed a medcab request and notified him of it, explaining why I was skipping the RFC step: <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AClarence_Thomas&#38;diff=303449545&#38;oldid=303444005" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AClarence_Thomas&#38;diff=303449545&#38;oldid=303444005"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AClarence_Thomas&#38;diff=303449545&#38;oldid=303444005" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AClarence_Thomas&#38;diff=303449545&#38;oldid=303444005">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AClarence_Thomas&#38;diff=303449545&#38;oldid=303444005</a></a>. He brought the issue here instead. And that action, too, belies his claim to simply want &#34;more eyes on this situation&#34; and &#34;cooler heads&#34; (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASimon_Dodd&#38;diff=303465221&#38;oldid=303178548" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASimon_Dodd&#38;diff=303465221&#38;oldid=303178548"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASimon_Dodd&#38;diff=303465221&#38;oldid=303178548" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASimon_Dodd&#38;diff=303465221&#38;oldid=303178548">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3ASimon_Dodd&#38;diff=303465221&#38;oldid=303178548</a></a>): he would get that at medcab, so if that was his goal, he could simply participate in the medcab dispute. That he came <i>here</i> instead - to the <i>admin noticeboard</i> - is telling. It&#39;s not hard to read between the lines. What he wants is an admin who agrees with him to stamp their imprimatur on his position. What else could he hope to get here, as opposed to elsewhere - the content noticeboard, for example, or the medcab dispute? If his intent was otherwise, he could simply have stayed in the medcab framework, or compromised in the first place.</p>
<p>Unless Mastcell returns to edit warring (he has suspended fire, for now), we should let the dispute resolution process run its course. The issue is now at medcab, and if Mastcell is sincere in merely wanting more eyes and cooler heads on the situation, he can simply assent to medcab&#39;s jurisdiction.&#60;font face=&#34;palatino linotype&#34; color=&#34;#000000&#34;&#62;- Simon Dodd&#60;/font&#62; &#60;small&#62;{ <a href="" title="User:Simon Dodd">U</a>·<a href="" title="User talk:Simon Dodd">T</a>·<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Simon_Dodd">C</a>·<a href="" title="WP:LAW">WP:LAW</a> }&#60;/small&#62; 13:49, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>FWIW, I would reject a MedCab case myself, Simon. Your accusations of MastCell are the worst kind of <a href="" title="WP:ABF">ABF</a> - you are clearly not attempting to work to resolve this amicably. I strongly suggest to you that you consider that MastCell is not only highly experienced, and an admin, but one of our best BLP editors. If he says BLP is one thing, and anyone else says another, I will admit to a strong predilection to simply stamp the issue with &#34;Agree with MastCell&#34; and move on. He&#39;s that right about BLP, that often. <a href="" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a>&#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a>&#60;/sup&#62;<a href="" title="User:Heimstern/Ignoring incivility">Advice</a>&#60;/small&#62; 14:07, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>A wise Wikipedian, KillerChihuahua, once wrote that &#34;AGF is not a suicide pact. We assume good faith absent evidence to the contrary. Once that evidence appears, it is not a failure of AGF to point out failings or misdeeds; rather, it is a failing of common sense not to do so.&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KillerChihuahua" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KillerChihuahua"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KillerChihuahua" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KillerChihuahua">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:KillerChihuahua</a></a> Quite so.

<p>Without commenting on the rest of your post, I repeat myself: if anyone ever suggests MedCab to me, I will reject it. No insult is intended to the good people who volunteer there; I have had several bad experiences. I will accept MedCom, but not MedCab. Its that simple. I suggest you stop suggesting MastCell should have accepted MedCab.  MedCab is most helpful to those who really don&#39;t know WP policy. For more difficult disputes, it is often out of its depth. <a href="" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a>&#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a>&#60;/sup&#62;<a href="" title="User:Heimstern/Ignoring incivility">Advice</a>&#60;/small&#62; 14:35, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The beginning of dispute resolution is always to try to resolve things with the other editor. Other venues exist, such as Rfc, both article and individual; 3o; very informal mediation on a sub-page between several parties, etc. No specific venue is a prerequisite, and very few (I would even say almost none) of the MedCom cases come from MedCab. Generally, parties choose either MedCab or MedCom at that stage, not one then the other. <a href="" title="User:KillerChihuahua">KillerChihuahua</a>&#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:KillerChihuahua">?!?</a>&#60;/sup&#62;<a href="" title="User:Heimstern/Ignoring incivility">Advice</a>&#60;/small&#62; 18:59, 22 July 2009 (UTC)

My experience with RFCs is that it&#39;s a crapshoot whether you get any input and they can take <i>weeks</i> - which is useless without some kind of process for determining what the article looks like <i>while the RFC is open</i> (eventualism has no place whatsoever in the BLP context, see <a href="" title="WP:BLPSTYLE">WP:BLPSTYLE</a>; see also <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Living People Patrol/Development">Wikipedia:Living People Patrol/Development</a>; <a href="" title="User:Doc glasgow/The BLP problem">User:Doc glasgow/The BLP problem</a>). In most bilateral content disputes, both sides will always be happy to be patient while an RFC runs <i>provided</i> that the article reflects their desired status for the duration. I&#39;m happy to punt it to medcom if medcab proves unhelpful; frankly, I anticipated going there anyway, in due course (that&#39;s why I said above that &#34;we should let the dispute resolution process run its course&#34; rather than &#34;we should let medcab run its course&#34;).&#60;font face=&#34;palatino linotype&#34; color=&#34;#000000&#34;&#62;- Simon Dodd&#60;/font&#62; &#60;small&#62;{ <a href="" title="User:Simon Dodd">U</a>·<a href="" title="User talk:Simon Dodd">T</a>·<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Simon_Dodd">C</a>·<a href="" title="WP:LAW">WP:LAW</a> }&#60;/small&#62; 22:38, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>Simon, it would be easier to resolve this if you redacted some of the comments MastCell objected to. It&#39;s becoming increasingly clear to me that Wikipedia creates an environment where it&#39;s easy to get offended and offend on the basis of misunderstandings, innocent errors and minor breaches of various policies -- especially when discussions have turned hot, as they tend to do on sensitive topics. It&#39;s particularly easy to get offended and then look like a POV pusher, but MastCell has a good reputation for a reason. Better to tone it down, look the other way and assume you might have been mistaken, and do all this for a while longer than you think reasonable. It really is so much easier than going through dispute resolution (chewing glass is easier). I don&#39;t think we&#39;re dealing with a POV pusher here. Continued reasonable discussion would lead to a better result. I&#39;m going to redact some of my own comments at BLPN as a start. -- <a href="" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Noroton">talk</a>) 18:39, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>People with bad reputations can be right and people with good reputations can be wrong. I have no idea what MastCell&#39;s reputation is, but in this instance he&#39;s wrong, and he&#39;s insistent about it, as the history demonstrates. As to removing earlier comments, I&#39;m generally opposed to doing that sort of thing, but if Mastcell has particular comments that he thinks it&#39;ll help cordiality to remove, I&#39;ll do so.&#60;font face=&#34;palatino linotype&#34; color=&#34;#000000&#34;&#62;- Simon Dodd&#60;/font&#62; &#60;small&#62;{ <a href="" title="User:Simon Dodd">U</a>·<a href="" title="User talk:Simon Dodd">T</a>·<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Simon_Dodd">C</a>·<a href="" title="WP:LAW">WP:LAW</a> }&#60;/small&#62; 22:37, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<li>I&#39;m not entirely sure I agree with the editnotice in its current form. As I understand it, AN is for complex disputes and such, while ANI is for incidents requiring immediate administrator intervention. Announcements and general information should go at a relevant village pump. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 02:12, 23 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, even complex disputes are routinely discussed as &#34;incidents&#34; at ANI. What tends to happen is as they get complex, a subpage is created (see &#60;span class=plainlinks&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixIndex&#38;prefix=Administrators%27+noticeboard%2FIncidents%2F&#38;namespace=4" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3APrefixIndex&#38;prefix=Administrators%27+noticeboard%2FIncidents%2F&#38;namespace=4">ANI example subpages</a>)&#60;/span&#62;.

<ul>
<li>I think ban discussions belong on AN. Incidentally, this thread really belongs at <a href="" title="WT:Administrators&#39; noticeboard">WT:Administrators&#39; noticeboard</a>. I notice someone there complaining about the size of the edit notice, I&#39;ve shrunk the font a bit. –&#60;font face=&#34;verdana&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="user:xeno"><b>xeno</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34; face=&#34;verdana&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 02:39, 23 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The archives and subpages of ANI include many discussions of bans and indefinite blocks. Ban discussions, whether simple or complex, seem to be able to get plenty of exposure there. Those are incidents too, as are many other ANI posts needing a good level of admin input. With 2000 or so admins, posts on ANI needing attention still tend to mostly get it. The distinction is notices vs. incidents, not simple vs. complex. <a href="" title="user:FT2">FT2</a>&#38;nbsp;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&#62;(<a href="" title="User_talk:FT2">Talk</a>&#38;nbsp;|&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 02:47, 23 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m not saying it doesn&#39;t happen. I just don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea. For whatever reason, discussions at <a href="" title="WP:AN">WP:AN</a> seem to be a little more calm and rational than ANI. Ban discussions belong here (especially unban ones). Most of the ban discussions on ANI are subthreads of incidents for users where the ANI thread highlights the fact that they have exhausted the community&#39;s patience. I&#39;m not saying those conversations should have a venue change to AN if it evolves into a ban discussion. But if someone is proposing a ban as a thread-starter, or unban, I think this is the proper venue. –&#60;font face=&#34;verdana&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="user:xeno"><b>xeno</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34; face=&#34;verdana&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 02:49, 23 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree with Xeno. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 02:52, 23 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>This would imply that admins are less calm or less rational at ANI than here, or that calm rational admins preferentially avoid ANI. If that&#39;s in fact what&#39;s being said, there&#39;s a bit more of a serious problem; a wide range of other significant discussions (not just one kind) would be being affected by an implied poor discussion quality of ANI culture. Is that actually a visible problem? <a href="" title="user:FT2">FT2</a>&#38;nbsp;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&#62;(<a href="" title="User_talk:FT2">Talk</a>&#38;nbsp;|&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 03:01, 23 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Remeber it&#39;s not only admins that respond to these threads. ANI is a bit like throwing <a href="" title="chumming">chum</a> into a pool of sharks. It&#39;s just the mentality there &#60;small&#62;(I actually wouldn&#39;t mind seeing ANI shut down altogether and forcing the threads to filter to the proper places, though that would probably run counter to your current proposal to move stuff off AN =) Ironically, someone a few months back was trying to do a similar relocation drive to keep stuff off ANI!)&#60;/small&#62;. AN doesn&#39;t seem to attract as many drama seekers. So, while I believe that un/ban discussions belong here, I do see above a lot of threads that should&#39;ve been posted elsewhere. –&#60;font face=&#34;verdana&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="user:xeno"><b>xeno</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34; face=&#34;verdana&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 03:05, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>Then the needed step is to address standards where they happen, on ANI - a step that any admin who uses ANI can help or hinder. Improving calm thoughtful discussion is <i>part</i> of the admin role, so users who act like a shark pool or incite in a &#34;chum-like&#34; manner..... that&#39;s the issue you&#39;re raising, and if it&#39;s so then it&#39;ll affect any/all discussions on ANI, serious or localized, not just some. It needs fixing where it&#39;s happening, not just shutting down and watching it move. If they won&#39;t say it&#39;s not okay at ANI, then logically, there is no barrier ensuring they would anywhere else either. We had to shut down the sanctions noticeboard a year or two ago because that was a &#34;shark pool&#34; (so to speak)... at some point we have to realize that shutting down isn&#39;t the answer, facing poor behaviors by users, admins role modeling good conduct, and generally requiring good interaction standards, is whats needed, not mere running away from the problem if any. <a href="" title="user:FT2">FT2</a>&#38;nbsp;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&#62;(<a href="" title="User_talk:FT2">Talk</a>&#38;nbsp;|&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 03:26, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>I agree, but easier said that done. As with any <a href="" title="mob mentality">mob mentality</a> it&#39;s hard to pinpoint the trouble source. –&#60;font face=&#34;verdana&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="user:xeno"><b>xeno</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34; face=&#34;verdana&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 03:38, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>Solution mirrors the source. It&#39;s trivially easy if a few people want it. Source is a critical proportion of experienced users being <a href="" title="enabling">enabled</a>, allowed, or encouraged to feel comfortable with it and considering &#34;shark mentality&#34; reasonable in some discussions, so much so that others can pick it up from them. Guess what the solution would look like. Hand-wringing and large scale debate isn&#39;t needed, it just needs individual users and admins that routinely will speak calmly and constructively, in enough numbers to dilute the disruptive behaviors, to resolve it. Often it only needs 2-4 such users deliberately acting to a good balanced standard in a dispute, to make poor conduct in the dispute less tenable. (And a user who rejects that many calm reasonable uninvolved users&#39; requests to act better is a good candidate for evidenced dispute resolution/RFC/RFAR.) The problem is the &#34;leave it to others&#34;/&#34;Meh&#34; mindset; that doesn&#39;t work. Ultimately it&#39;s got to be faced. Shutting down or running away aren&#39;t an answer. <a href="" title="user:FT2">FT2</a>&#38;nbsp;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&#62;(<a href="" title="User_talk:FT2">Talk</a>&#38;nbsp;|&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 03:53, 23 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>This is along the same lines as a discussion we had on AN a few months ago, which resulted in a newfound willingness to migrate errant discussions to the proper boards as well as the <a href="" title="Template:Editnotices/Page/Wikipedia:Administrators&#39;_noticeboard/Incidents">AN/I edit notice</a>.

<li>My impression, as a regular reader but infrequent participant at AN and AN/I, is in line with the opinions at <a href="#ANI_curiosity" title="WT:Administrators&#39; noticeboard">WT:Administrators&#39; noticeboard</a>: AN/I has an aspect of urgency and <i>action</i>. I agree with the moves of <i>Protect Mark Buehrle</i> and <i>Possible highjacked account</i>, but I disagree with the wording of the editnotice here and  , which could be interpreted to cover most recent AN discussions.

<dd>There was discussion of this at the numbers &#38; dates RfC -- both of them. I got some feedback there. Since when do I need to get feedback first before making bold edits? Did you get consensus somewhere before you suddenly popped up opposing what I was doing? This is an odd time for Ottava Rima to be objecting to having &#34;See also&#34; links in articles. Anyone, take a look at <a href="" title="Benjamin Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a>. Sound familiar? That&#39;s because it&#39;s the featured article for Wikipedia, on the front page, <i>right now</i>. It has a &#34;See also&#34; section which links to <a href="" title="List of American Civil War generals">List of American Civil War generals</a>. That&#39;s very much like the links I added to articles about poetry published in a particular year: A link to the article for the poetry published in that particular year. I pointed this out to Ottava Rima in an attempt to politely discuss the matter on our talk pages. I was met with rudeness there and rudeness here and rudeness by Ottave Rima on SandyGeorgia&#39;s talk page. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=303449337" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=303449337"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=303449337" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=303449337">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:SandyGeorgia&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=303449337</a></a> (lovely, isn&#39;t it?) Why is it that when I politely engaged you in discussion, you just insulted me and stopped discussing, then went to some other editor&#39;s talk page and insulted me further there? The ultimate question really is this: What do you think gives you the right to treat other editors this way when Wikipedia has a policy called <a href="" title="WP:CIVILITY">WP:CIVILITY</a>? I looked in that policy but nowhere does it say &#34;This applies to all editors except Ottava Rima&#34;. This AN complaint is an attempt to get here first after I asked Ceoil on that editor&#39;s talk page <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ceoil&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=304018746" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ceoil&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=304018746"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ceoil&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=304018746" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ceoil&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=304018746">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ceoil&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=304018746</a></a> whether or not I should make a complaint against Ottava Rima here.

<dd>Fair question, ThruanX. I&#39;ll find the link later (I need to go offline for an hour or so), but in the last two dates &#38; numbers RfCs late last year or early this year, there seemed to be a number of editors who said piped links were not a good idea for year-in-something pages. I thought adding a &#34;See also&#34; section at the bottom would remove that objection and still give readers a chance to know there was an article about other poetry published that year. There&#39;s nothing new about &#34;See also&#34; sections. Please see the comments I made on Ottava Rima&#39;s talk page about this (link in that note to Ceoil I copied above). The year-in-poetry pages have a lot more information than any category ever could.

<li><i>Please provide an example. I&#39;m adding a link to the corresponding year-in-poetry page to the &#34;See also&#34; sections of articles on poems and books of poems. It isn&#39;t some kind of stretch to see why that could be useful for a reader. I don&#39;t actually recall doing so for any GA or FA articles, but if I did, that would be perfectly acceptable, since plenty of FAs (including many recent ones) have &#34;See also&#34; sections.

If I add a link at an article about a book or poem to a list about contemporary poetry, there&#39;s a pretty strong reason for that link, at least as strong as the one on the Benjamin Harrison page. The &#34;[year] in poetry&#34; articles and similar pages are, like all lists, partly for navigation, partly for information, partly to help serious students and people who browse to find related information, so in the right spots, they&#39;re very helpful.

<dd>Don&#39;t administrators give editors who are constantly uncivil &#34;civility blocks&#34;? I think Ottava Rima should get one. His incivility just goes on and on. Other editors shouldn&#39;t have to put up with what I&#39;ve just gone through. Here&#39;s a list of this editor&#39;s abuses in just four edits by him or her:
<ul>
<li><i>I am talking about you randomly adding see also sections to GAs and FAs simply because you want to draw attention to your article in a highly inappropriate manner.</i> <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AReconsideration&#38;diff=303434454&#38;oldid=303413691" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AReconsideration&#38;diff=303434454&#38;oldid=303413691"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AReconsideration&#38;diff=303434454&#38;oldid=303413691" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AReconsideration&#38;diff=303434454&#38;oldid=303413691">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AReconsideration&#38;diff=303434454&#38;oldid=303413691</a></a> Isn&#39;t this a violation of <a href="" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>? There was nothing &#34;random&#34; about it, and I was doing what every WP editor is supposed to do: try to improve the encyclopedia. He makes it sound like I&#39;m trying to promote myself. You&#39;re <i>supposed</i> to try to link to articles you&#39;re trying to improve. It&#39;s part of improving them. It&#39;s in WP:STYLE somewhere or some other Wikipedia page suggesting to editors what they should do. </li>

<li>To SandyGeorgia: <i>He doesn&#39;t seem to care or care about anything but linking his pages where ever he can. I can&#39;t stand people who make such low level nonsense and promote it out the wazoo</i> (same link as the last one) I don&#39;t <i>care</i> about improving the encyclopedia.

<dd>Reconsideration - you have linked the pages you worked on to thousands of articles in what constitutes as spam. Those comments about your -work- clearly do not violate civil in any way, and saying that those pages are useless is a fact. You have not gone through an RfC. You have not sought consensus.

<dd>There is no policy against see also sections. In fact, the MOS explicitly permits them as a guideline: <a href="" title="WP:ALSO">WP:ALSO</a>. The two well-known books on Wikipedia  explain  how to use them, as do many help pages. Most Wikipedia articles that are more than stubs have them.  None of the FA related pages I can find in WP space   give their absence as a criterion. If OR or other active FAC people wish to deprecate them, they should try to change the guideline in the MOS or at least their own pages, which seem to have consensus as informal guidelines--as they well might, since the advice given there about article writing is extremely sensible.   Insisting on removing them would seem unjustified.   However, to put them in thousands of articles, apparently against known or predictable opposition, is remarkably unwise. BOLD depends on being reasonable, and this is not.  An overbold use of BOLD does not help cooperative editing. Insisting on one&#39;s own way on style does not help cooperative editing either--nobody owns a page.  I suggest the people involved try to discuss the issue and if necessary involve the rest of the community. <b><a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> (<a href="" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a>) 01:21, 25 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd><i>to put them in thousands of articles</i> -- I never put them in &#34;thousands&#34; of articles; you&#39;re assuming Ottava Rima&#39;s exaggerations, which he&#39;s done constantly in everything about this, are accurate, in fact I have put them in a lot of articles; <i>apparently against known or predictable opposition</i> -- where do you get the idea that the &#34;opposition&#34; was either known by me or predictable? Nobody ever said I shouldn&#39;t add these links until Ottava Rima did a day or two ago. As I said, the current featured article, <a href="" title="Benjamin Harrison">Benjamin Harrison</a> has a similar link in a &#34;See also&#34; section, and that article was recently passed through FA. So where&#39;s this opposition, even at FA? What is it that I&#39;m doing that isn&#39;t done everywhere on Wikipedia? I do it repeatedly because I see places that need these useful links. The year-in-poetry pages have been expanded, going back 500 years, over the past 12 months or so, so these links wouldn&#39;t have been made before that, but links have been made to the longer-lasting year-in-poetry pages for some time. I don&#39;t understand what people think I&#39;m doing wrong or where in policy/guidelines it says I shouldn&#39;t do this. Is there a spot in <a href="" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a> that I missed? I brought the matter up when the year-linking RfCs came up but didn&#39;t get told I shouldn&#39;t do this. When Ottava Rima objected I immediately tried to discuss the matter with him on our talk pages -- and Ottava Rima stopped discussing and abused me. When I added a &#34;see also&#34; section to the <a href="" title="Lucy poems">Lucy poems</a> article, Ottava Rima reverted it and abused me again in the edit summary. At every step I&#39;ve tried to follow policy/guidelines and at every step Ottava Rima has been rude and has turned away from discussion. And when Ottava Rima reverted on the Lucy Poems page, I started a discussion at that article&#39;s talk page. You don&#39;t get consensus without discussion, and I&#39;m not required to wait for consensus when I can&#39;t predict that something I&#39;m doing will be controversial. I see some editors commenting here, but there&#39;s still no consensus against it. Consensus at FA? It evidently isn&#39;t there, as I pointed out to Ottava Rima, who then stopped discussions. What have I done wrong? What has Ottava Rima done right? If I did something wrong, how was I supposed to know? -- <a href="" title="User:Reconsideration">Reconsideration</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Reconsideration">talk</a>) 01:36, 25 July 2009 (UTC) &#60;small&#62;revised my statement in minor ways&#60;/small&#62;

<dd>Which part of your objections is an issue for this noticeboard? If you want to combine all the pages, do an AfD or merge discussion or RfC or whatever. Then you&#39;ll successfully run me off Wikipedia and I&#39;ll tell everybody to go to hell and you&#39;ll be happy. The pages are separate because they have the potential to be a lot like <a href="" title="2008 in poetry">2008 in poetry</a> which is too big to merge and <i>still</i> doesn&#39;t cover its subject because it concentrates too much on English-language poetry. Compare that with the worldwide coverage of <a href="" title="1965 in poetry">1965 in poetry</a> and then compare with <a href="#Events" title="1945 in poetry">1945 in poetry</a>, which still probably doesn&#39;t cover a fourth of the events involving poetry in that year that it could cover, and there are prose sections, occassional quotes, pictures and whatnot. The field of Indian poetry, surprisingly to me, is huge (see the coverage at <a href="" title="1935 in poetry">1935 in poetry</a> to pick a random 20th-century example). For someone who wants to either browse or is a serious student of poetry, these pages are valuable, and that&#39;s why their traffic statistics show so many visits each month. The number of articles being edited is irrelevant if what I&#39;m doing is OK with policy and consensus. If you object, it&#39;s your job to show me where I&#39;ve gone against either policy or consensus. You haven&#39;t. Instead you&#39;ve been insulting. We know that you don&#39;t like what I&#39;m doing, but where&#39;s your proof that it&#39;s wrong? <a href="" title="User:Reconsideration">Reconsideration</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Reconsideration">talk</a>) 01:56, 25 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Since I&#39;m neither disrupting anything, nor going against any consensus, nor going against any policy, nor doing anything harmful to Wikipedia, there&#39;s nothing for this noticeboard to do. At <a href="" title="Talk:The Lucy poems">Talk:The Lucy poems</a> the discussion I started is going on. While discussion continues anywhere, I won&#39;t add any more links to &#34;See also&#34; sections, but as soon as discussion dies down and no new discussion crops up anywhere else, and if there is no consensus, it seems reasonable to me to resume because I&#39;m just following regular Wikipedia practice. I&#39;ve also added links to Bibliography sections of poet articles (most recently, see <a href="#Poetry_collections" title="Peter Viereck">Peter Viereck</a>). An RfC would probably be a good idea, with a three-part question: Should Wikipedia allow the links to be added to articles about works of poetry? If so, should they be added in &#34;See also&#34; sections or within the text of the article? If within the text of the article, as piped links (with an explanation in parentheses for multiple mentions) or as unpiped links? I want readers to be able to use this year-in-poetry resource. As far as I can tell, despite the fact that these year-in-poetry pages are still only a fraction of what they can be, there is no better poetry chronology with a worldwide scope anywhere, online or offline, than this one. And it&#39;s available to anyone with an internet connection, and it has links to articles for in-depth coverage of most of its poets. I don&#39;t care how it&#39;s linked from poetry-related articles, but it should be linked, and I think most editors would agree. It&#39;s also the most footnoted of any of the year-in-subject pages. Against all this, Ottava Rima has insults, disparaging comments, unproven assertions and assumptions of bad faith, but no arguments that I&#39;ve seen. I think a consensus of editors would agree with me. <a href="" title="User:Reconsideration">Reconsideration</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Reconsideration">talk</a>) 04:42, 25 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>I can&#39;t support a topic ban of any sort against Reconsideration. He&#39;s trying to improve things; I can find good faith in his edits, and I think my skepticism on that mark is well documented. I would ask him to stop, and bring this to the appropriate places - poetry, MoS, and see what can be worked out. It may turn out that linking &#39;year&#39; in &#39;topic&#39; articles should be in the same named caegory, and that&#39;s how readers can find such articles. I&#39;m not sure that a year alone is enough of a connector for a topic like poetry; certainly the idea that cultural exchange was having much influence on contemporary poetry before the last couple hundred years is still debatable, not carved in stone. I could see &#39;Victorian Poetry&#39; being a See Also-worthy addition, or Post-revolution french poetry, or some such thematically linked thing, but a year alone may not be enough. I may be wrong. Take it to the experts, sort it out.

<ul>
<li>I think that is the point; that a &#34;see also (Year) in poetry&#34; section is spurious if the only relevant information in that article is already in the article being linked from.  For example, in <a href="" title="Christabel (poem)">Christabel (poem)</a>, it is mentioned that the poem was published in 1816 in the work &#34;<i>Christabel; Kubla Khan: A Vision; The Pains of Sleep</i>&#34;, but the See Also section is to <a href="" title="1816 in poetry">1816 in poetry</a>,  where the only relevant information to the article is that ... the poem was published in &#34;<i>Christabel; Kubla Khan: A Vision; The Pains of Sleep</i>&#34; in that year.  Whilst not wrong, as such, this is just pointless.  If the Year... article contained more relevant information to the article, then it could be justified, but I can&#39;t see how sections such as the example can be. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Black Kite">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Black Kite&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/b&#62; 11:11, 25 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

A sentence in the now-restored part reads <i>These may be useful for readers looking to read as much about a topic as possible, including subjects only peripherally related to the one in question.</i>). I have a lot to say about why the year is a useful link but this really isn&#39;t the place. I&#39;ll start a consensus discussion, probably an RfC on its own page, as soon as I have time, probably Monday. Please see the content discussion at <a href="" title="Talk:The Lucy poems">Talk:The Lucy poems</a> as well.

<dd>ThuranX - the topic ban would be to prevent any major changes until an RfC can be created to adjust how to do this. There are many pages that passed FA and GA.

<dd>Ottava, learn from me: I followed <a href="" title="Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle">Wikipedia:BOLD, revert, discuss cycle</a>, all in accordance with <a href="" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a>, and tried to adjust what I was doing once I saw some uncomfortableness with piped links at the numbers &#38; dates RfC. Then I started using &#34;See also&#34; sections, in accordance with <a href="" title="WP:SEEALSO">WP:SEEALSO</a>. I never had a hint that what I was doing was either anything but normal editing or objected to by anybody until you left a confusing note on my page. I then tried to engage you in discussion, asking questions and politely explaining my reasoning. When you stopped discussing the matter with me on our talk pages and made personal attacks, uncivil comments and assumption-of-bad-faith comments on SandyGeorgia&#39;s page, it was reasonable of me to conclude that you weren&#39;t interested in working together. I continued adding the &#34;see also&#34; sections and you reverted at <a href="" title="The Lucy poems">The Lucy poems</a> page with a rude editorial summary comment. When you did that, you didn&#39;t add the link in the text, you just removed the link. Then I started the discussion on the talk page there, where, true to form, you&#39;ve continued your rudeness, although that discussion shows further support for the links. In the face of your immediate and constant rudeness, assumptions of bad faith, lack of interest in coming to consensus and ignoring of my efforts, I eventually went to Ceoil for advice. At no time did I attack you in return, nor was I even rude to you. Since you and one or two other editors have now objected to the way I&#39;m doing it and raised this content issue, I&#39;ve been flexible and agreed to start a discussion to get a consensus, just as you had suggested. I&#39;ve been flexible in stating that I can support any kind of links, so long as I can be reasonably sure that what I&#39;m doing has enough support out there that it&#39;s likely to stick. Even just above, I asked you if you could come to an agreement on this, and you ignored the offer. Your maliciousness has been baseless and astounding -- it&#39;s odd that admins here haven&#39;t blocked you already for your campaign of ongoing incivility. There is no further need for this thread, and some editor should box it for archiving. I&#39;m done here and I&#39;ll start an RfC, with a notices at Village Pump and elsewhere. <a href="" title="User:Reconsideration">Reconsideration</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Reconsideration">talk</a>) 17:32, 25 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd><b>And here is further justification from a Wikipedia guideline</b>. From <a href="#Year_linking" title="Wikipedia:Linking">Wikipedia:Linking</a>, a Manual of Style guideline: </dd>
<dd>&#60;blockquote&#62;Year articles (<a href="" title="1795">1795</a>, <a href="" title="1955">1955</a>, <a href="" title="2007">2007</a>) should not be linked unless they contain information that is germane and topical to the subject matter—that is, the events in the year article should share an important connection other than merely that they occurred in the same year. For instance, <a href="" title="Timeline of World War II (1942)">Timeline of World War II (1942)</a> may be linked to from another article about WWII, and so too may <a href="" title="1787 in science">1787 in science</a> when writing about a particular development on the metric system in that year. However, the years of birth and death of architect <a href="" title="Philip C. Johnson">Philip C.

<dd>If <i>a particular development on the metric system in that year</i> is worth linking to a year-in-science article, then the publication of a book of poetry (or perhaps writing of one) is an obvious candidate for a relevant link to that year in poetry, according to the manual of style. Also, according to <a href="" title="WP:EGG">WP:EGG</a>, I shouldn&#39;t be piping the links except in lists and charts where being concise is important. I guess I&#39;ll add something like &#34;published in 1807 (see <a href="" title="1807 in poetry">1807 in poetry</a>)&#34; although that looks a bit awkward as a replacement of a simple year in parentheses when a book publication year is mentioned. If Ottava Rima objects to the linking, he should take it up at the MoS guideline. If there is a particular problem with a link in a particular article, it can be worked out on that talk page. I&#39;ll be happy to avoid adding &#34;see also&#34; sections. What further consensus do I need to continue following the November-December &#39;08 RfC and <a href="" title="WP:LINK">WP:LINK</a>?

<p>I was <a href="#Never-ending_disruption_by_Grundle2600" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39;_noticeboard/IncidentArchive548">topic banned</a> from editing political articles becuase I had created new political articles that, while very well sourced, were deleted based on consensus. The deletion discussions for these articles was wasting the time of other wikipedia editors, who otherwise would have been spending their time on better, more productive ways to improve wikipedia. I now realize that just because a subject is well covered in the media, such as Michelle Obama&#39;s arms, or Barack Obama swatting a fly, does not, in and of itself, justify the creation of an article on that subject. When I created those articles, I thought I was following <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Be bold">Wikipedia:Be bold</a>. However, I now realize that I was being &#60;i&#62;too&#60;/i&#62; bold. As an example of how I have learned my lesson since then, after Michael Jackson died, I thought about creating <a href="" title="Death of Michael Jackson">Death of Michael Jackson</a>, but then I decided not to, because I realized that just because the subject was heavily covered in the media, it did not necessarily justify it having its own article. Eventually, somoene else created the article, which is why it is blue instead of red. I have learned my lesson, and I am being much more restrained when it comes to creating new articles. <a href="" title="User:Grundle2600">Grundle2600</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Grundle2600">talk</a>) 16:31, 26 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>This topic ban was enacted 1 month from today, and you began making appeals earlier than that. Although your comment suggests you are keen and learning, your responses at that time showed some very fundamental problems with your understanding of (and approach to) Wikipedia. In light of all of this, the fact that this topic ban will expire after another 2 months, and other concerns expressed at the time of the topic ban being imposed, I&#39;m not comfortable supporting your appeal at this time. <b>Oppose.</b> <a href="" title="User:Ncmvocalist">Ncmvocalist</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ncmvocalist">talk</a>) 16:56, 26 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd><b>Oppose</b>. The topic ban came after continued disruption by Grundle2600, despite repeated efforts by myself and other admins and editors to explain why his editing patterns were problematic (Grundle took this to mean I had some sort of bias against him, but this was not remotely the case). I see no reason to rescind the topic ban at this point, particularly given some of Grundle&#39;s behavior over at <a href="" title="Talk:Presidency of Barack Obama">Talk:Presidency of Barack Obama</a>. As you can see over there, the article talk page is utterly dominated by a section created by Grundle titled &#34;Changes that I would like to be made to the article&#34; which includes eight subsections (part of the problem to begin with was Grundle&#39;s continued insistence that he should get to add &#34;what he wants&#34; and others should get to add &#34;what they want,&#34; despite repeated explanations that this violated WP:NPOV). Instead of adding material since he can&#39;t do that at the moment, he constantly proposes new additions to the article talk page, and other discussion there is basically dead (Grundle largely took over the talk page prior to his topic ban). Not all of the proposals there are problematic, but several are, particularly <a href="#Recovery.org_says_government_paid_.241.2C191.2C200_for_two_pounds_of_sliced_ham" title="Talk:Presidency_of_Barack_Obama">this</a> and <a href="#Family_Smoking_Prevention_and_Tobacco_Control_Act" title="Talk:Presidency_of_Barack_Obama">this</a>. Both are unbelievably non-notable: the first was simply inaccurate, and it&#39;s a bit hard to AGF with regard to the second suggestion, which would have us point out, in the article about an <i>entire presidency</i>, that an African American president signed a law which bans flavored cigarettes but excepted menthols (for those who don&#39;t know, there is a stereotype, though it is rooted in actual <a href="#Economics_and_regulation" title="Menthol_cigarette">data</a>, that menthol cigarettes are essentially only smoked by African Americans).</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>So on an article talk page Grundle seems to be continuing his determined effort to include every piece of negative (as he construes it) ephemera possible about Obama. I think the initial topic ban should absolutely not be rescinded at an early date, and indeed it&#39;s regrettable that it did not include article talk pages. I&#39;m glad that Grundle now admits that creating an article about Barack Obama killing a fly was not appropriate, but his disruption went well beyond that. --<a href="" title="User:Bigtimepeace">Bigtimepeace</a> &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User_talk:Bigtimepeace">talk</a> |  <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Bigtimepeace">contribs</a>&#60;/small&#62; 17:00, 26 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>There can be no question of rescinding the topic ban - it is quite evident from <a href="" title="Talk:Presidency of Barack Obama">Talk:Presidency of Barack Obama</a> that Grundle has learnt little about distinguishing between what is significant and what is trivial. Furthermore, to pick just one recent episode which calls into question his behaviour, at <a href="" title="Talk:American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009">Talk:American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009</a> he proposed inserting a phrase implying the govt spent $1m on 2lb of ham after it had already been explained at <a href="" title="Talk:Presidency of Barack Obama">Talk:Presidency of Barack Obama</a> that the purchase involved many 2lb units. The questions an examination of Grundle&#39;s recent record raises are not an end to the ban, but an extension, in length and/or to talk pages (at least for Presidency of Barack Obama, which as others have noted he&#39;s quite taken over with his comments). <a href="" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:rd232">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 19:54, 26 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I concur with the above statements. If you (Grundle) want to show your improvement of your understanding how to edit you can and should do so in the talk page area. That would be in my opinion the best way to go for now and could improve your chances for this ban [I&#39;m not talking about the ARB decission, or do you?] to be lifted early or at least not to be extended. Think about it before you keep posting the same old repeatedly on talk pages.

<p>Thanks for your comments everyone. I&#39;ll just wait the two more months.</p>
<p>Rd232, I never said the government spent a million dollars on two pounds of ham. What I said is that the government wrongly claimed that it spent that much money on two pounds of ham. The article gives the government response to Drudg&#39;s criticis, but the article does note cite Drudge&#39;s criticsm. That violates NPOV.</p>
<p>This is how I think the paragraph should be. The bolded sentence is my proposed addition:</p>
<p>&#34;On July 20, 2009, the Drudge Report published links to pages on Recovery.org which detailed expensive contracts awarded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture for items such as mozzarella cheese, frozen ham and canned pork. &#60;b&#62;For example, recovery.org stated that &#34;$1,191,200&#34; was spent on &#34;2 POUND FROZEN HAM SLICED.&#34;&#60;/b&#62; A statement released by the USDA the same day explained that the mult-imillion dollar contracts were intended to purchase food items under The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) and defended the expenditures.[47]&#34;</p>
<p>Without that bold sentence, the article does not say what Drudge&#39;s complaint was. However, the article does include the government&#39;s response to Drudge. That violates NPOV.</p>
<p>Rd232, you&#39;re OK with the Hugo Chavez articles mentioning that he supports farming collectives. But you removed the stuff that I added from The Washington Post about how the food production of those collectives is substantially less than what it was when the same land had been previously owned by rich people and big corporations. That violates NPOV. You also removed my addition about Chavez using the military to seize coffee from smugglers who were trying to take it out of the country to sell at a price that was higher than what was legal under Chavez&#39;s price caps. Also, you greatly watered down the info about how his price controls are causing food shortages. You also removed the info that I added about Chavez imposing a 15% &#34;luxury tax&#34; on toilet paper. All of those removals violate NPOV. </p>
<p>Bigtimepeace, I suggested adding the thing about banning flavored cigarettes as a single sentence, right after the already existing part about raising the cigarette tax. Why is it OK to have the thing about the tax, but not OK to have the thing about banning flavored cigarettes?</p>
<p>Bigtimepeace, you said, &#34;he constantly proposes new additions to the article talk page, and other discussion there is basically dead (Grundle largely took over the talk page prior to his topic ban).&#34; First of all, it is not possible for me to &#34;take over&#34; the talk page. The fact that other people aren&#39;t starting other sections on the talk page is not my fault. I do not control the talk page, or prevent anyone else from talking there. In fact, I put all of my talk page suggestions together into a separate section, so as not to interfere with the rest of the talk page. Second, the reason the talk page seems is &#34;dead&#34; is because everyone else (except me) who wants to add criticism of Obama to the article has been topic banned from the talk page. So the reason the talk page is &#34;dead&#34; is because the article is now controlled by Obama supporters, it looks like a press release, and there is no dissent. </p>
<p>Bigtimepeace, you are correct that the only stuff that you or anyone else objects to me adding about Obama is negative stuff. No one, including you, has ever objected when I added positive stuff about Obama. For example, when I added <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidency_of_Barack_Obama&#38;diff=296979135&#38;oldid=296977919" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Presidency_of_Barack_Obama&#38;diff=296979135&#38;oldid=296977919">this</a> (Obama wants to extend federal benefits to same sex partners) and <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Political_positions_of_Barack_Obama&#38;diff=289481883&#38;oldid=289139784" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Political_positions_of_Barack_Obama&#38;diff=289481883&#38;oldid=289139784">this</a> (Obama wants to close failing schools, and then reopen them with new principals and teachers), no one removed them. It seems that you people only remove the negative stuff that I add about Obama, and never the positive stuff. Why is that?</p>

I am unable to make edits, because if I make an edit then some editor(s) tell that I&#39;m a sock puppet of my first account and immediately delete my new account. BUT how on the Earth could I close my old account if that is already blocked? Here is the section from wiki: </p>
<p>&#34;When an account is discontinued, it is recommended that the old account be noted on its user page as being inactive, in order to prevent the switch being interpreted as an attempt to abusively sock puppet. The   tag can be used.&#34;</p>

<dd><a href="" title="Steve Smith">Steve Smith</a>.  Never mind the problem of there being what seems like 200 articles for people with this name, we have two, born the same year, both played hockey, both played the same position.  That one&#39;s always been my example of when disambiguation breaks down horribly. Also, I think North Americans need to get <i>less</i> creative with names.  Its no wonder the English language is breaking down when kids are being named Ashtyn, Benjamyn, Benjimen, Brandin, Gracee, Mikenzie,  and my personal favourite from Alberta in 2007: Mihsa-Taiyoo-Lily-Jean. <a href="" title="User:Resolute">Reso</a><a href="" title="User Talk:Resolute">lute</a> 14:12, 29 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>In accordance with <a href="#Decision_to_ban" title="Wikipedia:Banning_policy">Wikipedia:Banning_policy</a> and <a href="#Community_ban" title="Wikipedia:Banning_policy">Wikipedia:Banning_policy</a> I request to impose an indefinite community ban on  .</dd></dl>
<p>II.) <b>Reasoning</b> &#60;br&#62;
</p>
<dl>
<dd>Since this user&#39;s first edit, he has not contributed anything constructive or useful. Instead, he uses Wikipedia to <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Gaming the system">game the system</a>, to bring it into disrepute, and, worst of all, to harass, attack and insult other users (mostly off-wiki, <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Gaming the system">in order to be not blocked on-wiki</a>). For those reasons, he has already been indefinitely <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;type=block&#38;page=User%3AEricBarbour" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;type=block&#38;page=User%3AEricBarbour">blocked 2 times</a>; though, those blocks have been undone (each time by single administrators, not per a consensus whatsoever). </dd></dl>

<ol>
<li>a) No evidence of less drastic attempts at behavior modification less severe than indefinite ban b) Off-wiki behavior, except where it directly threatens action against the Wiki, shouldn&#39;t make a difference here.  If he&#39;s calling you bad names off-wiki, don&#39;t read those sites.  Insofar as he isn&#39;t attempting to be incivil on-wiki, I don&#39;t see the real problem.  There are lines that can be crossed off-wiki, but seriously, we could indef-ban half of WR for the shit that gets posted there.  I have in the past advocated for banning based on off-wiki behavior, but IMHO, this does not qualify.  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#000099&#34;&#62;Jayron&#60;/font&#62;</a><b><i><a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#009900&#34;&#62;32&#60;/font&#62;</a></i></b> 22:36, 29 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>No. Our critics are a needed part of this process. I note that those edits he does make to the mainspace are positive, non-vandal edits. Further, I&#39;m not sure that notifying editors of off-wiki criticism is entirely without merit; it may upset some, but if the criticism is actually balanced (I recognize that some of the WR users are never balanced in their hate of all things WP), then it may actually assist. I&#39;d like to see him contribute more to article-space, and in a less inflammatory manner on WP:Space pages, but I can&#39;t see it being to our advantage as a project and community to continually stifle or suppress external criticisms. <a href="" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ThuranX">talk</a>) 22:47, 29 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>I don&#39;t agree that off-wiki behavior can&#39;t justify a ban, but this editor has so little <i>on-wiki</i> behavior (a total of 298 edits since 2004, including deleted ones) that a ban at this point would be essentially symbolic. <a href="" title="User:Looie496">Looie496</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Looie496">talk</a>) 22:55, 29 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>Oppose. Although I&#39;m well aware that the user in question attacked me for my oppose vote to LaraLove&#39;s OS election that he strongly supports, only highlighting on EricBarbour seems unfair. Even several admins/editors who are active on WR do not apply the Wikipedia civility policy to there and loosen their verbal language, so I think his off-Wiki comments is not actionable enough to ban him.  --<a href="" title="User talk:Caspian blue"><b>Caspian</b> blue</a> 00:13, 30 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> : I have no axe to grind either for or against Eric Barbour, although he has opined on WR about my personal circumstances, which are no business of his, or anybody else&#39;s. I do what I do, and he does what he does, and that should be the end of it. If he wants to criticise WP on WR, he&#39;s free to do so, although obviously he is obviously in more congenial company there than here, among the various malcontents who have been unable to accept our values and processes. Pissing on the tent from outside smacks, to me, of <a href="" title="WP:SOFIXIT">sour grapes</a>. BUt he shouldn&#39;t be banned as long as he produces acceptable content here, and does not push the boundaries in unacceptable ways; he is not alone in that regard, because we seem to tolerate producers of extremely good, and voluminous content, whose &#34;political&#34; skills are perceived to be lacking elsewhere. Horses for courses, I say. If you want to produce good content, do so. If you want to change the political landscape here, feel free to try. If you want to make trouble, you deserve all you get. There&#39;s a <a href="" title="social contract">social contract</a> here, and breach has its consequences. Meanwhile, if Eric Barbour wants to resist this proposal, he should either remove the <a href="" title="WP:SOAPBOX">vague criticisms of admins</a> on his talk page, or justify them by raising <a href="" title="WP:RFC">relevant issues</a>.

<dd>re Peachey&#39;s suggestion: I suggested something like this before, but it was pointed out that it may not be fair, or practical, to protect an image on commons every time it is being used on some other project&#39;s MP (keeping in mind that en-wiki is not the only Wikipedia project that has DYK). That was a legitimate complaint, I think; and with that ruled out, I see no alternative to the gritty, painstaking work of uploading local images every couple hours (or at least every time an admin prepares one of the DYK queues). &#60;b class=&#34;Unicode&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Rjanag">r&#60;font color=&#34;#8B0000&#34;&#62;ʨ&#60;/font&#62;anaɢ</a>&#60;/b&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Rjanag">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62;/&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Rjanag">contribs</a>&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 11:18, 29 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>I don&#39;t see with is wrong with asking commons to temporary protect the batch of them in a automated message to their board asking for it nicely because that way we don&#39;t need to manually upload it (and probably break some things, but i&#39;m not expert at attribution and such) and they already do it for other projects that ask for it afaik and I have seen them do it for single images of ours before. <a href="" title="User:Peachey88">Peachey88</a> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User_Talk:Peachey88">Talk Page</a>&#60;span style=&#34;font-weight:bold;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;·&#60;/span&#62;  <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Peachey88">Contribs</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 13:36, 29 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>You have that backwards.  There is even a specific template on <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Template:Enwiki_main_page">commons</a> for protection of enwiki main page files.  You all have to realize that they can&#39;t protect the images if they don&#39;t know which images need protection.  For things like DYK, there usually isn&#39;t that great of a window from the time somebody decides it will go on the main page to the time that it actually is on the main page.

<dd>It shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to write a bot to figure out what&#39;s going to be on the MP, upload it locally, and protect it.

<dd>The bot as it was programmed before (<a href="" title="User:MPUploadBot">MPUploadBot</a>) didn&#39;t really work. The bot would upload files late, or would upload them after they were off the main page and deleted from en.wiki. This is because it depended on the link tables (the &#34;list images on this page&#34;) which does not get updated instantaneously after every update to the page. On most pages it doesn&#39;t matter, but here it does. This is also why cascading protection is not instantaneous.

<dd>If some admin wants to write a bot all it would need to do is null edit (edit/save without changing anything) the main page before checking and uploading what ever images needed to be addressed. this would force a full refresh of all table links for that page on demand and make the cascade protection bug moot. I know its not recommended procedure but for a situation like the main page it would work.

<p>Beta, your IRC bot seems to be suffering from the same bug.

The <a class="externallink" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;page=File:MarkusHowell.jpg" rel="nofollow" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;page=File:MarkusHowell.jpg">Commons log</a> for the file shows the image was always protected while on the Main Page. <a href="" title="User:Shubinator">Shubinator</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Shubinator">talk</a>) 00:16, 30 July 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>The above list is not entirely accurate, but we have been experiencing a significant problem with unprotected Commons images appearing on the main page via <i>DYK</i>.&#60;br /&#62;
I&#39;ve been checking <a href="" title="Template:Did you know">Template:Did you know</a> and all of the queues whenever I&#39;m online (and protecting any unprotected images that I&#39;ve encountered).  I repeatedly reported the issue in <a href="#Unprotected_images" title="Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 48">this thread</a>, and I eventually added <a href="" title="Template:Editnotices/Page/Template:Did you know/Queue">this editnotice</a> to all of the queues.  When that didn&#39;t work, I began posting messages on the talk pages of the sysops who were inserting the unprotected images.  Since then, the frequency seems to have been greatly reduced.&#60;br /&#62;
However, there is a simple solution that has not yet been implemented.  <a href="" title="Template:Did you know">Template:Did you know</a> is automatically updated by <a href="" title="User:DYKadminBot">DYKadminBot</a> (which transfers the content of the six queues at scheduled intervals).  In other words, almost all <i>DYK</i> images are placed on the main page by that bot.  <a href="" title="User:DYKadminBot">DYKadminBot</a> should simply verify that each image is protected (either locally or at Commons) and if it isn&#39;t, it should post a notification message instead of performing the update.  I contacted <a href="" title="User:Nixeagle">Nixeagle</a> (the bot&#39;s operator) both on-wiki and by e-mail weeks ago, and he/she has not responded (despite performing several edits since then).  —<a href="" title="User:David Levy">David Levy</a> 01:14, 30 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Professionalism may be changing as a reflection on society.  Many people view professionalism as a positive.  For example, employees being kind to customers, not saying anything on their mind (instead of &#34;you ugly, fat complainer who wants something free, just take a number&#34; saying &#34;I&#39;ll help you as soon as I finish this call&#34;).  On the other hand, I now see that some people think professionalism is bad, thinking that professionalism means working.

<dd>Yes, <a href="" title="WP:GLOSSARY">WP:GLOSSARY</a>. I&#39;m also fairly certain there&#39;s a guideline or essay somewhere pointing out that newbies don&#39;t know the jargon, so full names and explanations should be used when they&#39;re likely to be around. I don&#39;t see the issue of using such terms in places like AN and ANI (ahem, the Admin&#39;s Noticeboard <i>et al</i>) where the majority of users reading these posts are going to be experienced and know what&#39;s being spoken to. Most of the time when acronyms are used, they&#39;re linked anyway, since it only adds a couple brackets and a WP: to it.

<p>Most societies or cultural groups have their own language, argot, or <i>jargon</i> which helps them to identify fellow members and exclude non-members. WP is no different in that regard. Wikimarkup is another example of this - there&#39;s no technical reason why WP couldn&#39;t have a WYSIWYG editor, even without raising the technological bar (i.e., using javascript).

<dd>So... was F203&#39;s friend&#39;s point that using jargon is &#34;juvenile&#34;?

<dd>The main purpose of jargon is to permit members of a group to concisely describe things specific to their group.  To take an example from my profession (computer programming), I could say &#34;the latest build segfaults on startup&#34;, or I could say &#34;during the process of preparing itself for user interaction, the version of the program compiled from the current source code is terminated by the computer&#39;s operating system because it tries to access a location in the computer&#39;s random-access memory that it is not permitted to access&#34;.  Which is more likely to be used -- and did you notice that even the &#34;jargon-free&#34; version contains technical vocabulary specific to the profession? --<a href="" title="User:Carnildo">Carnildo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Carnildo">talk</a>) 21:36, 29 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Exactly. I&#39;d have to ask this friend if s/he thinks doctors are juvenile because they use jargon? How about lawyers, or architects? Maybe s/he just used a poor choice of words, and meant &#34;why the hell is it so hard to understand what they&#39;re talking about?&#34; In which case, I point to Carnildo&#39;s comment: the jargon arose because it&#39;s quicker &#38; easier for Wikipedians to understand what&#39;s going on. It&#39;s not intentionally made difficult for the layman to understand, anymore that particle physics was made specifically obfuscated for excluding the common man. &#38;mdash; &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:HandThatFeeds">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Comic Sans MS; color:DarkBlue;cursor:help&#34;&#62;The Hand That Feeds You</a>&#60;/span&#62;:&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:HandThatFeeds">Bite</a>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/b&#62; 14:28, 30 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>We need more checkusers who are dedicated to this page.  I find it depressing to process sock puppetry cases when I have to wait a long, long time to get checkuser requests fulfilled.

<dd>Actually, the bottleneck is at the other stages of the process. Once one of my reports is approved for checkuser attention, it is nearly always run within 18 hours.

<dd>That&#39;s the fast part. It&#39;s the evaluation of behavioural evidence that goes slowly, and takes time from the other activities.

<dl>
<dd>As far as clerks are concerned, several new clerks have recently come onboard to help, myself included. Most of the cases have not requested CheckUser, either because the behavioral evidence is clear to the point that CheckUser is not necessary, or that the user(s) filing the SPIs are unaware about how to request CheckUser or may not exactly know if one is needed. Most of the legwork needs to be done by patrolling admins who determine if there is sufficient behavioral evidence that sockpuppetry is going on. <a href="" title="User talk:MuZemike">MuZemike</a> 18:01, 31 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I&#39;ve spent an hour going through cases. If I thought the evidence was strong but not compelling, I placed them on the checkuser queue. There were a few that quacked very loudly, and anyone with the bit can go through, block them, and place tag the case for closing:

However, I do not believe that nondisruptive edits, such as the one I saw on my Talk page from Macromonkey, or the IP comment above, should be considered violations of anything, and I&#39;ll be arguing this before ArbComm. Bans allow rapid block on discovery, we do it for efficiency, so that we don&#39;t have to debate the same issue over and over. Not editing per the Standard Offer is a demonstration of respect for community consensus. Note, however, that if an editor is desperate to make constructive edits outside of articles known to be of interest to Macromonkey, the likelihood of them being identified as sock edits is about zero. If, later, MacroMonkey comes back and wants to take responsibility for those edits (I&#39;d recommend it), we would not block the editor, assuming that they were, indeed, good edits. But there is an obvious risk.</li>
<li>Further, I&#39;m going to be arguing before ArbComm that self-reverted edits, nondisruptive in themeselves but only technical violations, are not offenses against ban policy, which exists to protect, not to punish. Even if a self-reverted edit is *wrong*, it&#39;s automatically undone and nobody need do anything about it. I&#39;ll give the arguments for this at RfAr. However, it can do nothing but improve the project and provide an open door for a banned editor to begin making constructive contributions immediately, and for the contribution to take effect, if this is in an article that was a reason for the ban, cooperation by or with editors <i>who supported the ban</i> may take place, hence the divisions behind the ban may start to heal. The edit summary &#34;will self-revert per ban,&#34; per ban &#34;of MacroMonkey&#34; in this case, actually shows respect for the ban and trust in the community (true violating IP socks don&#39;t identify themselves so that they can be immediately blocked!). MacroMonkey should know, however, that, though myself-reversion proposal was approved by one arbitrator, previously, about another banned editor, when I later was banned and actually relied on it to make a one-character correction to a reference, I was immediately blocked and editors piled in to approve that action. So this isn&#39;t accepted yet. Soon, I hope.  --<a href="" title="User:Abd">Abd</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Abd">talk</a>) 23:47, 31 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>As such, I would recommend that this block be shortened to a more reasonable progression of blocks. I would suggest that this block be reduced to one week or two weeks, as a month from 72 hours is a large jump. I suggest this based on the wording &#34;appropriate period of time&#34;. I do not feel that a month block for minor edit warring and minor annoyance is suitable. I would feel more comfortable with a time limit of one week or two weeks at the very most. <a href="" title="User:Ottava Rima">Ottava Rima</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ottava Rima">talk</a>) 14:19, 30 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_from_blocking_admin">Statement from blocking admin</span></h3>
<p>As the admin who pushed the block button on Peter, I&#39;ll say that I believe the length of my block is justified (perhaps too lenient), but if the community decides otherwise, then I&#39;m fine with that.  Given his history, and the fact that he has been blocked multiple times since ArbCom passed their motion concerning him back in December, it seems apparent to me that he is not willing to abide by any conditions that are set on him, and that respect for policy is not there.  Short term blocks have proven to be ineffective in preventing recurrences.  That much is apparent just from looking at his block log -- I didn&#39;t even know about his other accounts (as noted by Seddon above) when I made the block.  So, given that, it would seem that anything short of an indefinite block would be inappropriate.  However, I did notice comments from other users noting that Peter has made some good content contributions.  So, given that, and a desire to create <b>less</b> drama than an indef block would have generated, I settled on one month, with the hopes that the situation between him and FT2 would have a chance to cool off in that time.  <a href="" title="User:Mikaey">&#60;span style=&#34;color: #6598e3&#34;&#62;Mikaey&#60;/span&#62;</a>, <a href="" title="User talk:Mikaey">&#60;span style=&#34;color: #d70303&#34;&#62;Devil&#39;s advocate&#60;/span&#62;</a> 18:48, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The &#34;creates good content&#34; excuse is a red herring insofar as allowing disruption to go unchecked.  No content created by one person cannot otherwise be created by another, with the thousands of editors here, no one is irreplaceable.  However, one diruptive user can drive dozens of otherwise non-disruptive users from the project by creating an unworkable environment.  So the question becomes?
<ol>
<li>Do we mind losing his potential future content contributions by eventually indeffing him, </li>
<li>Do we mind more losing the contributions from the dozens of other people he is going to drive away if he is allowed to continue this behavior unchecked.</li></ol></dd>
<dd>I will vote for #2 every day and twice on sundays.  The deal is, no one is irreplacable, so it comes down to cold mathematics.  His contributions cannot outweigh the damage he does in driving other users away.  If he doesn&#39;t want to be blocked, he can stop acting in a way that he should know will get him blocked.  But we should not consider mainspace contributions as a mitigating factor in issues like this.  What of the mainspace contributions from all of the people who up and left because of people like Peter Damian?  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#000099&#34;&#62;Jayron&#60;/font&#62;</a><b><i><a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#009900&#34;&#62;32&#60;/font&#62;</a></i></b> 02:39, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd><a href="" title="Whistleblower">Whistleblowers</a> are disruptive.  How they are dealt with says a lot about the health of the institution in which it the whistleblowing occurs.    Institutions that regard whistleblowing purely as a disciplinary problem, or as a problem of people not pulling together with the team, and which make no effort to get to grips with the matter of whether the allegations made are true, are sick organisations.  So I reject Jayron&#39;s either/or; there are more reasons why good editors might leave WP than being aghast at the spectacle of seeing speech-restricting injunctions flouted. &#38;mdash; <i>Charles Stewart</i> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Chalst">(talk)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 10:48, 31 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That would be great except this isn&#39;t a whistleblower situation as much as Peter Damian would like to paint it as one. While he may have had a point at times, there are ways to make good points and point out problems you see without crossing the line into utter and complete disruption. Choosing repeatedly to do the latter is what has gotten Peter into this situation. Not whistleblowing. - <a href="" title="User:Taxman">Taxman</a> &#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Taxman">Talk</a>&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 15:52, 31 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed.  Whistleblowing would be a Good Thing.  Being a general disruption because you disagree with other people is a Bad Thing.  You can be a vocal opponent of Wikipedia and its power structure without being just mean and harassing.  There is a huge difference between vehement, but civil, disagreement and with just being a general dirsuption.  Peter Damian crossed into the latter category long ago.  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#000099&#34;&#62;Jayron&#60;/font&#62;</a><b><i><a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#009900&#34;&#62;32&#60;/font&#62;</a></i></b> 18:47, 31 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

I would like to propose the creation of a new page, the &#34;<a href="" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/Abuse">Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/Abuse</a>&#34;. The abuse noticeboard would be for allowing users to report suspicious activity related to long term abuse (eg, long term sock abusers), and to allow users dealing with abusers to track and find reports of occurrences of such abuse. Now, AN/I, AIV, LTA and SPI are sometimes used for this, however users often don&#39;t report unless they are absolutely sure something fishy is going on, at AIV not all admins may be familiar with the situation, LTA is only used for more extreme cases, and at SPI the puppet master might not be known. This would also provide a centralized place to track such abuse as well as alerting other users for activity to be on the lookout for. Any ideas? <a href="" title="User talk:Triplestop"><b>&#60;font color=&#34;blue&#34;&#62;Triplestop</b></a> <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Triplestop">&#60;small&#62;x3&#60;/small&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 01:06, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Why can ANI not continue to handle this like it already does?  Why continue to balkanize the admin noticeboards?  Having fewer locations to check in on allows more admins to monitor and respond to more situations.  Unless there is some new <i>process</i> which would require such reports to be seperated out, I don&#39;t see why SPI (for where the sockmaster is known) and ANI (for where it is not) are not currently sufficient.  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#000099&#34;&#62;Jayron&#60;/font&#62;</a><b><i><a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#009900&#34;&#62;32&#60;/font&#62;</a></i></b> 03:03, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

<ul>
<li> </li></ul>

<p>I read about un-block requests.  These are usually decided by one person.  But this is a very important issue so there should be Wikipedia-wide administrator discussion so we don&#39;t get Wikipedia into hot water.</p>
<p>See the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Portrait_Gallery_copyright_conflicts" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Portrait_Gallery_copyright_conflicts">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Portrait_Gallery_copyright_conflicts</a></p>
<p>Then see this
Amisquitta apparently represented Anthony Misquitta of Farrer &#38; Co, who did in fact co-write the legal notice I received. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s wise to get involved as an administrator in matters related to the NPG, but neither would I object to an unblock. Dcoetzee 06:42, 1 August 2009 (UTC) </p>
<p>An administrator already got involved and blocked User:Amisquitta.  This looks like retaliation by Wikipedia.</p>
<p>Because this is an unusual case, shouldn&#39;t Amisquitta be unblocked?  If Amisquitta begins to edit badly or threatens, he can be reblocked. </p>

<dl>
<dd>To avoid confusing any pending legal matters, I <b>oppose</b> unblock. The above comment, attributed to Dcoetzee, appears to have been copied here from the latter&#39;s enwiki talk page: <a href="#National_Portrait_Gallery_copyright_conflicts" title="User talk:Dcoetzee">User talk:Dcoetzee</a>. The admin who placed the block on 10 July was <a href="" title="User:Georgewilliamherbert">User:Georgewilliamherbert</a>. The immediate reason for the block appears to be the use of the Wikipedia email system to forward a legal notice to Dcoetzee. Reference above to &#39;unblock request&#39; might be confusing because Amisquitta has not himself requested unblock. The notice at <a href="" title="User talk:Amisquitta">User talk:Amisquitta</a> by GWH asks that Amisquitta contact Mike Godwin for any further discussion. It is reasonable that Mr. Misquitta and Mike Godwin must have a direct channel available for them to communicate on, so the urgency of undoing this block is not clear. If Mike G. were to advise undoing the block, then it should obviously be undone. For normal legal threats, under <a href="" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a> the block is kept in place while the case is pending: &#60;blockquote&#62;<i>If you must take legal action, we cannot prevent you from doing so. However, it is required that you do not edit Wikipedia until the legal matter has been resolved to ensure that all legal processes happen via proper legal channels.</i>&#60;/blockquote&#62; This appears sensible, so that statements made through on-wiki interaction don&#39;t get added to the court case, if one were to be filed. No disapproval of Mr. Misquitta personally is implied by this stance, since he may have felt it was a necessary step in his case to try to use Wikipedia email to notify the person whose actions he is questioning. (He may have had no other means of reaching him). <a href="" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:EdJohnston">talk</a>) 17:57, 1 August 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Well, the photo is on Flickr and tagged as CC: <a class="externallink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gi/836822/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gi/836822/"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gi/836822/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gi/836822/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/gi/836822/</a></a>. It&#39;s possible that it&#39;s mis-tagged or that whoever uploaded it didn&#39;t actually have the rights. I&#39;m not seeing it elsewhere on the web, so it&#39;s tough to tell. Do you have any active reason to believe the image is not actually CC?

<dd>Looking at that photographer&#39;s work, they seem to tag everything as CC-BY-SA, including things like screen captures or magazine covers (<a class="externallink" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gi/247189295/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gi/247189295/">example</a>) that they plainly don&#39;t hold any rights for. Moreover, their blogger profile <a class="externallink" href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3063763" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3063763"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3063763" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.blogger.com/profile/3063763">http://www.blogger.com/profile/3063763</a></a> says that they are (or were whenever they wrote it) thirty years old, but the original photograph is dated from 1985 - they would have been twelve years old at the oldest. I&#39;m inclined to believe that this is just a scan of someone else&#39;s photograph that they don&#39;t hold any rights to, and consequently I don&#39;t believe the licensing can be correct. &#60;span  style=&#34;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;— <a href="" title="User:Gavia immer">Gavia immer</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gavia immer">talk</a>)&#60;/span&#62; 02:46, 2 August 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>If that&#39;s the case, the file should be tagged for deltion, citing the problems with the flickr user misapplying cc-by-sa tagging of other inappropriate material, and the reasons that this tagging is called into question.  If we have reason to suspect that something is mislabeled at flickr, we should not in good conscience continue to host it here. --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#000099&#34;&#62;Jayron&#60;/font&#62;</a><b><i><a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#009900&#34;&#62;32&#60;/font&#62;</a></i></b> 03:18, 2 August 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

</p>
<ul>
<li>Civility. Finneganw has goaded other editors, e.g. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300139957" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300139957"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300139957" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300139957">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300139957</a></a><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300258230" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300258230"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300258230" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300258230">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300258230</a></a><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300334372" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300334372"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300334372" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300334372">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300334372</a></a><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aggiebean&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300561541" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aggiebean&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300561541"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aggiebean&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300561541" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aggiebean&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300561541">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Aggiebean&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=300561541</a></a>, despite being advised against it <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=300033524&#38;oldid=300031930" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=300033524&#38;oldid=300031930"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=300033524&#38;oldid=300031930" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=300033524&#38;oldid=300031930">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=300033524&#38;oldid=300031930</a></a>.

<li>Verifiability. Finneganw insists on removing from the article or denying the validity of any source in the article when it disagrees with his own point of view. For example, he claims that a biography written by <a href="" title="Robert K. Massie">Robert K. Massie</a>, a former Rhodes Scholar who studied history at Yale and Oxford and won the Pulitzer Prize for biography, cannot be used as a source because it&#39;s &#34;wildly unverifiable rubbish&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=303706917&#38;oldid=303698265" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=303706917&#38;oldid=303698265"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=303706917&#38;oldid=303698265" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=303706917&#38;oldid=303698265">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Anna_Anderson&#38;diff=303706917&#38;oldid=303698265</a></a>. There are no sources supporting that viewpoint.</li>
<li>Trolling. Finneganw&#39;s <a href="" title="Talk:Anna Anderson">talk page</a> contributions consist largely of repeating the same unvarying statements, e.g. accusing his opponents of being rabid: <a

<p>Two years ago, Finneganw&#39;s previous accounts <a href="" title="User:Greergarsony">User:Greergarsony</a>, <a href="" title="User:Marrygracer">User:Marrygracer</a>, <a href="" title="User:Elizabethcrane">User:Elizabethcrane</a>, <a href="" title="User:Deustchman">User:Deustchman</a>, <a href="" title="User:Harrietbrown">User:Harrietbrown</a>, <a href="" title="User:Alexiacolby">User:Alexiacolby</a> and <a href="" title="User:Aussiebrisguy">User:Aussiebrisguy</a> were blocked after disruption at <a href="" title="Anna Anderson">Anna Anderson</a>. While his behaviour has improved (I don&#39;t see any further instances of sockpuppetry), it is still concerning, and still contributes to a toxic atmosphere at the Anna Anderson page, which has meant that normal editing there is impossible. I do not see any evidence of disruption on other pages, consequently, I feel that a ban on any contribution at <a href="" title="Anna Anderson">Anna Anderson</a> or <a href="" title="Talk:Anna Anderson">Talk:Anna Anderson</a> or its sub-pages would be the best way to prevent further poor behaviour. <a href="" title="User:DrKiernan">DrKiernan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DrKiernan">talk</a>) 10:50, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>As someone involved on <a href="" title="Talk:Anna Anderson">Talk:Anna Anderson</a>, I&#39;m tired of Finneganw&#39;s incivility and dismission. He&#39;s so blinded by his disdain of Anastasia=AA supporters that he&#39;s gone ahead to accuse a well-intentioned administrator (John Kenney), who is trying to prevent this article from turning into <a href="" title="The Skeptic&#39;s Dictionary">The Skeptic&#39;s Dictionary</a>, of being a AA supporter. Although Aggiebean has not engaged in the same level of incivility and otherwise disruptive behavior, she too is so blinded her biases that she refuses to accept the valid policy concerns raised by several administrators, including myself. &#60;span style=&#34;background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Nishkid64">Nishkid64</a> &#60;/span&#62;&#60;sub&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Nishkid64">Make articles, not wikidrama</a>)&#60;/sub&#62; 15:13, 23 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

One way or another, <a href="" title="Anna Anderson">Anna Anderson</a> is the unhelpful mess that it is owing mostly to the unencyclopedic sway Finneganw (under all those usernames) has had on it. All reliable sources clearly support the assertion that Anderson was an utter, straightforward fraud, but the article does nothing towards showing readers how she fell into it and pulled it off for so long, which very likely only leads some readers to thinking the article is so biased and lacking that maybe she <i>was</i> Anastasia, which is not on. <a href="" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gwen Gale">talk</a>) 16:06, 23 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>Completely disinterested observer checking in. Is there a possibility of introducing a mediation process and have the individuals involved in the content issue, vent there first? I realize that there is also an issue of temperament and decorum in respect to the heated discourse that has been engendered by the topic, but perhaps mediation may be of use.

<dd>Why should there be mediation on a user who has had numerous accounts blocked previously for the same behavior?  It&#39;s obvious they&#39;re not interested in collegiality.

<p>At the risk of my own wikipedia life, I am here try to right an injustice to plead his case. What happened to Finneganw was very unfair and biased. This man has fought tirelessly against POV vandalism, disruptive editing and discredited info being passed off as fact in the article for 3 years. In the past, it was never him who got in trouble, it was the outrageous Anderson supporters who attacked him. Now we seem to have a change of attitude due to one particular mod being swayed by his friend who espouses the pro Anderson point of view. This is not fair as Finneganw has done nothing wrong. ChatNoir24, on the other hand, has been very disruptive and quite over the top for years while touting his agenda which has long since been proven wrong. He has been banned, suspended and warned several times. Yet now, since a newcomer to the discussion agrees with this incorrect viewpoints, Chat is okay and sudddenly, after three years of it being the other way around, Finneganw is the bad guy? I do hope before anything is done to this kind person (Finneganw) that the entire history of the AA talk page even the archives and history be reviewed. </p>
<p>As for what is happening now, it is a strange anomaly that is not fair but being passed off as so. Due to wiki demanding everything be sourced, this falls right into the hands of the Anderson supporters since they have loads of pro Anderson propaganda to use, with much less being written after the DNA tests proved her a fraud. What has been written many times borrows from older sources, and doesn&#39;t say in so many words THIS STORY IS NOT TRUE. Because of this, a lot of really stupid stuff that could not possibly have really happened since we know Anderson wasn&#39;t Anastasia is being sneaked into the article using the excuse that we don&#39;t have a reliable source to say it isn&#39;t so, therefore it can stay. I believe this to be the wrong thing for the site, as wiki needs its articles to be up to date and accurate. With the final 2009 DNA tests proving all members of the Romanov family are now found and accounted for, Anderson is proved without a doubt to be a fraud, meaning some of the things she claimed are now impossible. We should use a little common sense and logical deduction here and leave out these things. The only real &#39;source&#39; I can show you is the DNA, so far no one has written a book mentioning each AA incident one by one and specifically stating &#39;this couldn&#39;t have happened&#39;, but this does not mean they should be in the article. As one other admin told us before, wiki does not regard all opinions equally and are under no obligation to give equal time to a lopsidedly wrong and disproven POV. This is the case with AA. For 3 years now, it has been the Anderson supporters who have been stopped from doing this, but now thanks to the addition of the pro Anderson JohnK I(yes, he is, regardless of his denials, I&#39;ve seen these arguments for years on many sites, NO ONE but NO ONE backs her that avidly, actively, prolifically and strongly if not a supporter) backed by Dr. Kiernan, it has completely turned the opposite way, which is the wrong thing for the article if it is to be fact based and verifiable and free of myths and allusions to a &#39;mystery&#39; that no longer exists. If anyone has any comments or questions please answer here or on my talk page, I have much evidence to back myself up if anyone will please take the time to listen.

<li>For what little it is worth, I am a royal pain, and I too plead for the topic ban on user Finneganw. How the stench of his rot has escaped your noses I cannot tell. And I will further beg you to take note of the user who has posted above, aggiebean, who has if nothing else been a staunch defender and enabler of Finneganw. I see Finnegan is still posting away, so I guess court&#39;s adjourned. There weren&#39;t this many admins involved in <i>my</i> ass-kickin&#39; regarding <a href="" title="Anna Anderson">Anna Anderson</a>, I&#39;ll tell you that!<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/75.21.101.78">75.21.101.78</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:75.21.101.78">talk</a>) 10:37, 25 July 2009 (UTC)--Sorry I posted again to state that I accidentally messed up a tiny end-portion of the signature of the preceeding post. Also I wanted to call to your attention that Finneganw has had in the past protection from adminstrator Nishkid64, or perhaps from DrKiernan himself. I am blocked from posting messages on Finneganw&#39;s talk page, and I am nearly 100% certain Nishkid64 is responsible for this. Investigate those who enabled Finneganw before you slap a topic block on him.

<li><b>Support</b> topic ban of <a href="" title="User:Finneganw">User:Finneganw</a> from the <a href="" title="Anna Anderson">Anna Anderson</a> article. If the ban is intended to improve the editing climate, he should also be restricted from the article&#39;s Talk page. Keeping him off the article proper would not have much effect, since Finneganw has only edited the article itself three times in July (the last time on July 8) while he has edited the talk page 128 times in July. Finneganw has been active on this article over a long period, and seems to have placed  himself on a permanent war footing due to the former activities of Anna Anderson supporters. (A quick glance shows that the present article is not at all pro-Anderson, so his militance seems unneeded). His present attitude seems to be getting in the way of normal article improvement, and the sharp and negative comments about the abilities of other editors are not helping. <a href="" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:EdJohnston">talk</a>) 17:00, 27 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>I also support this. I&#39;ve been aware of problems around Anna Anderson for a long time as I have previously had to deal with Finneganw and his various and numerous socks. Frankly, he was lucky he wasn&#39;t banned as his socking was extensive, disruptive and extended to emailing me under a female persona (User:Alexiacolby), informing me it was time for me to go on a lengthy wikibreak because, according to him, my actions as an administrator trying to contain his disruptive socking and block evasion were basically just &#34;trash&#34; and &#34;vandalism&#34;, appealing to me &#34;woman-woman&#34; and chastising me for treating a fellow &#34;woman&#34; that way (blocking very, very obvious and transparent sockpuppets). I think his disruption of the articles is extremely problematic as he is so fixated and seems unable to embrace Wikipedia&#39;s policies and due to the long term nature of it, the numerous blocks under various accounts etc, it seems he&#39;s not getting the Clue. The Anna Anderson article seems to be the centre of the problems (though in the past it has extended to various royalty and puppeteering (truly) articles a well). I also suspect that there are COI issues as well but that&#39;s not really got anything to do with my support of this proposal which is based entirely on his behaviour. I have also been concerned with the amount of personal commentary and battleground type editing that has been going on at that talk page in general, not just with him. Rather than dealing with the content, the editors there seem to have been spending an awful amount of time talking about each other. Hopefully with Finneganw taken out of the scenario that will improve but I recommend looking out for more socks and enforcing behavioural policies and guidelines on that talk page. <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 04:43, 29 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd><b>This is a plea for justice</b>. Banning user Finneganw from <a href="" title="Anna Anderson">Anna Anderson</a> <i>in totality</i> is fair and just. This user, immersed deep in deliberate sock puppetry and personal attacks, is the reason I have been indefblocked from the subject and even from talk pages of other editors. I deserved what I got for what I did. However, Finneganw has over the course of 3 years chased away valuable editors, casual users and even administrators...all people who could not bear his attacks. He successfully coordinated his hounding attacks in tandem with user aggiebean, though I do not address that user here. Now, DO YOUR JOBS and topic-ban Finneganw. It is a user like Finneganw that opens the doors to Revolution. ;)<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/75.21.101.157">75.21.101.157</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:75.21.101.157">talk</a>) 12:33, 30 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>By the way,   currently editing the Anna Anderson article is Finneganw. He edits on IPs on a couple of different Telstra IP ranges and in the past when he&#39;s been blocked he has simply logged out and continued on his merry way with dynamic Telstra IPs. It&#39;s clear he intends to continue editing the article whether logged in or out so I think this needs to be closed by an uninvolved admin and he needs to be informed as to the outcome of the discussion. <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 14:01, 1 August 2009 (UTC)

<p>Thank you Slp1, much appreciated. I&#39;ve removed the archive tags because I think there is a broader problem here. One of the reasons that Aussiebrisguy/Finnegan etc came to my attention originally was due to his edits to various Australian pages. One of the articles he wrote was <a href="" title="David Logan (playwright)">David Logan (playwright)</a> and has used socks to fiercely protect it, removing any attempts to tag etc. David Logan is currently on AFD and it&#39;s now come to my attention that Finnegan seems to have moved on yet again to   which is being used to spam David Logan books, references etc into a broad range of articles and has also posted a collection of articles about a vampire book that Logan has written, see <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dracula&#39;s_Return">Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Dracula&#39;s_Return</a>, including character and fictional location articles, all based entirely on Logan&#39;s book with no secondary sources (for example <a href="" title="Daria Borisovna Semovsky">Daria Borisovna Semovsky</a>, <a href="" title="Semovsky Palace">Semovsky Palace</a> and <a href="" title="Alexander Pavlovich Semovsky">Alexander Pavlovich Semovsky</a>), as well as spamming into any vaguely related articles such as <a href="" title="Count Dracula">Count Dracula</a>, <a href="" title="Brides of Dracula">Brides of Dracula</a>, <a href="" title="Alexander III of Russia">Alexander III of Russia</a>, and <a href="" title="Amalienborg Palace">Amalienborg Palace</a>. I&#39;ve removed the most obviously problematic instances of spamming but there&#39;s now also a report at <a href="#User:Saschapav" title="Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Spam">Spam#user:Saschapav</a>. I&#39;ve been reluctant to address this in depth (hence my vague comment above about COI) but it now seems unavoidable as the spamming has now spread across many articles and is clearly, IMHO, geared at promoting David Logan. I think we need to consider stronger and broader restrictions on this user. <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 03:51, 3 August 2009 (UTC)</p>
