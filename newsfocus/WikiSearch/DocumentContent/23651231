He attended Moses Brown School in Providence for his twelfth year of high school and graduated from the College at the University of Chicago with a B.A. in English in 1966.

<p>From the age of about ten, the family returned every summer to <a href="" title="Martha&#39;s Vineyard">Martha&#39;s Vineyard</a>, where Zoss participated in the Folk Revival of the 1950s and 1960s, meeting and playing with many of the seminal influences of the day, and began performing with <a href="" title="Alex Taylor">Alex Taylor</a> and his younger brother <a href="" title="James Taylor">James Taylor</a>.

<p>Zoss&#39; professional life has always balanced between prose and music, sometimes weighted heavily to one or the other, as during the 1980s into the 1990s, when he authored or co-authored over twenty five non-fiction books.&#60;ref name=&#34;joelrzoss&#34;&#62;Joel R.
