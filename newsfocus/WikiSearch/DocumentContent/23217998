<dd>Well, I knew this was going to happen. Look, this is not your ordinary Senate election. Importantly, it gives the Democrats 60 seats, which allows them to fight off a <a href="" title="filibuster">filibuster</a> if they maintain party unity. Secondly, it has attracted national attention because <a href="" title="Al Franken">Al Franken</a> is a celebrity and the race has taken so long. It is significant to more people than the train crash in Italy or the floods in Central Europe, and if those events are &#34;international,&#34; it&#39;s only because Europe is split into itty bitty little countries while the U.S. is a continent unto itself. I can&#39;t see what negative consequences would come from placing this one U.S. event on ITN. I&#39;ll say it for the thousanth time -- we should ensure ITN <i>as a whole</i> is international, not individual entries. -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 02:44, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>can u please explain &#34;It is significant to more people than the train crash in Italy or the floods in Central Europe&#34; because i highly doubt thats the case. unless u can somehow prove that people in US are so self involved that they do not find significance in anything that happens outside of US... again i highly doubt. <a href="" title="User:Ashishg55">Ashishg55</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ashishg55">talk</a>) 02:53, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>(Edit conflict) Not to blab on, but here&#39;s an example of why the Franken is so important. The US House of Representatives, which has no filibuster rule, has just passed a bill that would limit greenhouse-gas emissions for the first time in the US. The Republicans in the Senate could try to filibuster this legislation. But now that the Democrats have 60 seats, they could defeat the filibuster if they stick together. That means Franken&#39;s election could be instrumental in the passage of greenhouse-gas limits in the U.S., which accounts for 22% of worldwide greenhouse-gas emissions. Thus, Franken&#39;s election could play a major role in the worldwide fight against global warming. That&#39;s a lot more important than a subway crash, tragic as it was. -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 02:58, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>As a US user who tends to think outside of the US, I&#39;m not sure where to cast my line. This may not affect many people out of the country, but Mwalcoff has a point that hardly anything does. This, in essence, gives the ruling party the ability to pass any law its members propose; a pretty big deal. I know that of this was Togo or something it probably wouldn&#39;t be put up (it&#39;s doubtful we&#39;d even know about it) but the United States is one of the major players on the worlds stage and this is going to have a very big effect on it.

<dd><b>Oppose</b> - In politics the only items that go up are national elections, coups, changes of leader, or changes of other high ranking political officials (e.g. VP or, as was the case recently, the House of Commons Speaker). This does not fall under any of these categories and as such is not notable in political terms. We can&#39;t make acceptions for the US just because this is a big deal there. Per <a href="" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>, it is not our place to say that this is more important that a similar change in Australia or France - we can only deal with the facts. In this case those facts say the position in question is not high enough up the US political pyramid to be notable. Also I must warn of making comparisons to other ITN items that are in no way related. The Italy train crash is notable for being an <i>extremely</i> rare occurence. This on the other hand is a small scale political election, something which happens on a daily basis across the world --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 07:34, 1 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>(EC) I had the nasty feeling something like this was going to happen when I supported the Washington collision, albeit not so soon and not two at once. But I stick by my support of the Washington collision. And I oppose the Chinese one. As I mentioned in the Washington one, AFAIK the train and system there was an relatively modern one (I later learnt the train was one of the older stock, so may have been up to 30 years old which wasn&#39;t as modern as I thought but still not ancient) and the system had a very good safety. The collision was therefore highly notable and of great international interest even if the casualty count wasn&#39;t that high. As with Mwalcoff, I don&#39;t believe this is the case for the Chinese case. (This would be different if we were talking about <a href="" title="Shanghai Maglev Train">Shanghai Maglev Train</a> or some other modern train with an excellent safety record.) The Italy case appears to be close in fact probably more notable then the Washington one so I support that. I think the &#39;not just pure casualty count&#39; principle is well established on ITN. It&#39;s why a terrorist attack in Iraq killing 10 people may not get on ITN, but one in the France or Singapore or Brazil killing 3 probably will. Or some commercial airliner in Africa has some sort of incident killing 5 probably won&#39;t get on ITN but one in Europe or North America killing 2 probably will. <a href="" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nil Einne">talk</a>) 10:42, 30 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dt>China train crash</dt></dl>
<p>I don&#39;t mean to re-start this debate but after reading the discussion I must point out that according this <a href="" title="List of rail accidents (2000–present)">List of rail accidents (2000–present)</a>, it certainly suggests that there were a lot more railway accidents in the United States during this preiod than there were in China. A suggestion that railway accidents happen in China all the time, therefore it is non-notable, is plainly absurd. Having spent many years of my life in China I can tell you that a railway accident, let alone a railway collision, is a very uncommon occurence. The state is very concerned about its airline and railway safety record; in fact, it sees <i>any</i> incident involving public transport as a major failure of the government itself and generally fires many officials as a result of this. If this article does not make it on ITN over the Italy crash, I have to conclude that it&#39;s systemic bias on Wikipedia that has led to this. Also, it is true that these train crashes and another plane crash happening all at the same time would make ITN very crash-oriented, which is not something I support. But I do feel the attitude of some editors in this section are rather uninformed. <a href="" title="User:Quantyan">Quantyan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Quantyan">talk</a>) 14:53, 30 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I think the issue here is that the Iraqis see this as the &#39;end&#39; of US operations in the country, although in reality that isn&#39;t until September 2010. According to <a class="externallink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8125547.stm" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/8125547.stm">this article</a> they celebrated &#39;National Sovereignty Day&#39; despite the fact that there remain over 130,000 US troops in the country. My reading of it is that US forces will remain in action but they will no longer be in control. Also, the article states that large scale withdrawal of troops is not likely to start until next years elections. As a result I am going to have to oppose this going up now --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 20:14, 30 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>No offense, but I&#39;m not in agreement with this line of reasoning. Very few events are truly international. Trains don&#39;t usually crash on international borders. The key should be to ensure that ITN as a whole is geographically diverse rather than to try to make individual items &#34;international.&#34; That&#39;s not to say that if an item is of interest to people all over the world, we shouldn&#39;t take that into account. But every news medium, or list of headlines, or whatever ITN is, has some items that appeal to some people and some items that appeal to others, with differences based on geography and field of interest (entertainment, sports, science, etc.). -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 00:55, 30 June 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree that ITN should be as geographically diverse as possible. But since we usually pick our news from the anglophone media (which is completely biased towards coverage of anglophone countries) ITN tends to be very US/UK/Australia centric as well, and we should look to lessen this. If Madoff was already in ITN, we should use something else. <a href="" title="User:Offliner">Offliner</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Offliner">talk</a>) 01:33, 30 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>That&#39;s a fair point. However, I don&#39;t think ITN has been too heavily weighted to English-speaking countries lately considering the vast majority of English Wikipedia users likely come from English-speaking countries. I haven&#39;t been counting, but there hadn&#39;t been a U.S. entry for a while before the U.S. golf Open (not counting NASA items), and right now the only U.S. entry on ITN is Michael Jackson, which is really a world story. The only other English-speaking country item on ITN now is the diplomatic flap between Britain and Iran, which is the next to drop off the list. -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 01:55, 30 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

It&#39;s no different from the NATO exercises on the North German Plain through the Cold War. &#34;Russia launches major military exercises in Iowa&#34; might be ITN-significant… &#34;Russia launches major military exercises at the North Pole&#34; would almost certainly be significant. <a href="" title="User:Physchim62">Physchim62</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Physchim62">(talk)</a> 11:12, 29 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I don&#39;t agree with your argumentation that it being conducted in the North Caucasus makes it less notable. Major combat operations in Chechnya finished a long time ago. It&#39;s a very large exercise, probably among the largest in Russia after 1991. Obviously, it&#39;s not in the headlines of the international (i.e. anglophone) media, but it has a nice article and it would be a different subject for a change. (Usually we seem to have elections, accidents, plus all kinds of US/UK centric stuff on ITN.) <a href="" title="User:Offliner">Offliner</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Offliner">talk</a>) 11:55, 29 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<dd>This isn&#39;t the first time something like this has happened recently though... and it goes back to the example I used previously where the mayor of a Chinese city with a population of 9 million resigned in some corruption scandal and nobody batted an eyelid because the US didn&#39;t seem to notice and it was a footnote on the BBC. This state seems to have a population of under 4.5 million but because it is big news in the US it is noticed. This is of course just circumstance and there is nothing wrong with a nomination (which is what keeps ITN going) but I don&#39;t think this has any real logical significance for ITN so I will oppose (I use the population statistics as an aside though, and a curious one at that, not as a sole reason to oppose). --&#60;font face=&#34;serif&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User: Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;can&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User:Candlewicke/List of signatories">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;dle&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="WP:ITN/C">&#38;bull;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:green&#34;&#62;wicke&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 21:54, 24 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>@Candlewicke: Are you saying, then, that you don&#39;t want to support this because ITN and/or mainstream news media already has systemic bias towards US-related news? (apologies if I am misinterpreting your post.) If that is the case, as I&#39;m sure it is, wouldn&#39;t it be better to push for more non-US ITN items, rather than just reducing the number of US ones? &#60;b class=&#34;Unicode&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Rjanag">r&#60;font color=&#34;#8B0000&#34;&#62;ʨ&#60;/font&#62;anaɢ</a>&#60;/b&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Rjanag">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62;/&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Rjanag">contribs</a>&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 22:00, 24 June 2009 (UTC) </dd>

<dd>@Rjanag: No, I am simply treating this like I would any other ITN nomination. I am using other examples of the same thing occurring on a regular basis throughout the world, thus reducing its significance. It&#39;s like all the sudden bad weather nominations. Who will post them all and how will they all fit and why are we opposing those who might dare to nominate a few deaths in Iraq because there are too many? We have to see through the headlines and find some significance. ITN is also not the news and is not based on what the top story in a country is, otherwise we&#39;d have a different story to post for every country and how could 200 events be posted (or even fit on the Main Page) each day? --&#60;font face=&#34;serif&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User: Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;can&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User:Candlewicke/List of signatories">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;dle&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="WP:ITN/C">&#38;bull;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:green&#34;&#62;wicke&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 22:16, 24 June 2009 (UTC)

<p>(Edit conflict) Actually, very few ITN entries are truly &#34;international.&#34; There&#39;s nothing international about the Metrorail crash.

<dd>The significance of items posted on ITN these days is poor. What is the international significance of this story? Is this story of even medium level of importance in the countries history? Such appointments are very common across other countries. Forget Asia, even if we start putting such news items for all European nations, ITN would be like notice board of appointments. I see two ITN items which are not international in nature nor of the state&#39;s head or anything. Looks like tomorrow we might see an appointment of some city&#39;s mayor on WP front page. --<a href="" title="User:gppande">&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34; face=&#34;cursive&#34;&#62;<b>GP</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:gppande">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34; face=&#34;cursive&#34;&#62;<b>Pande</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> 19:53, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>To be honest I think you need to do more research into what exactly being the house of commons speaker entails. Generally speaking they can be regarded as the third most powerful person in the country after the Queen and PM, so the comparison to City Mayors is silly. Also because internationally significant items were so infrequent the ruling was changed to include items of international interest. If a story is being reported across the globe then it is a perfectly viable candidate to go up on ITN as long as its meets other criteria (i.e. encyclopaedic value, referenced update etc), even if it doesn&#39;t have international repecussions --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 20:12, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

I think the key is that ITN should be international <i>on the whole</i>, with items from around the world. Each item should be either very important or of interest to a great many Wikipedia users. The UK has the second-most English Wikipedia contributors behind the US, and this was a very major story in the UK. Instead of complaining, why not suggest a story from your country when something particularly noteworthy happens there? -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 21:57, 23 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s accurate to say there&#39;s no international interest in elections in Surinam (whatever that is) or <a href="" title="Suriname">Suriname</a>. Elections affect the government and the people leading a country. They therefore affect participation in international bodies, diplomatic relations, peace efforts and wars, et al. It is therefore quite common that diplomatic missions or ambassadors would comment (e.g. congratulate the winners) of an election, that new leaders or old leaders attending something will be spoken to e.g. congratulated by other world leaders after the elections. Ambassadors, diplomats, foreign relations ministers and even world leaders (and their advisers) would usually keep themselves informed of election results even of small countries like Suriname. It&#39;s their job. On the other hand, they&#39;re far less likely to bother to keep themselves informed of the arrest of members of the Sicilian mafia or even more so of who wins the US open, unless they have a personal interest. If the new leader of Suriname is slightly deranged or whatever and invade Guyana, that&#39;ll be a problem that leaders and world bodies will likely have to deal with. On the other hand, if Lucas Glover annouces he thinks it&#39;ll be a good idea to invade Guyana and kill their people with golf clubs, this will be of far lesser concern. If the leader of Suriname annouces he wants to develop nuclear, biological or chemical weapons, that&#39;ll be of great international concern. If Lucas Glover does it, perhaps he&#39;ll be arrested and get some insane celebrity headlines, but that&#39;s about it. The view that elections aren&#39;t of international interest IMHO is therefore more one reflecting a rather limited world view rather then reality and ignores the fact that who controls a country is of great significance and interest. P.S. Let&#39;s also remember that in reality, we don&#39;t really know how many wikipedia users there are from each country. All we know is wikipedia editors, and that was 3 years old. While it seem resonable to suspect that a fair number are from the UK, we shouldn&#39;t overemphasise what we actually know about wikipedia readers. <a href="" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nil Einne">talk</a>) 07:55, 24 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>The first of the season was listed only recently and given there frequency over the summer months I think we have start being more restrictive in terms of notability.

<dd>I wasn&#39;t planning on putting each one that forms up for ITN. I wasn&#39;t sure how to word this one but there was a fatality and 6 more people missing in Taiwan, so if someone could make a new line it would be much appreciated.

<dd>I knew that would pop up so I did think of a plan to avoid ITN becoming swamped with TCs. When a new TC is approved for ITN while one is currently up, the one that is currently up gets replaced by the newer one so there are never two at the same time. Another idea, a long shot though, would be to create a cyclone news section on the main page. It would note the newest impact information from current storms. But, I&#39;d rather not follow through with the latter. <a href="" title="User:Cyclonebiskit">Cyclonebiskit</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cyclonebiskit">talk</a>) 17:03, 22 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>It seems to me that won&#39;t necessarily solve the problem, it&#39;s still going to mean we will have a perpetual TC news item on ITN which is likely to result in complaints, particular if the only thing one TC is notable for is pounding country X and causing $50k of damage with no lost lives. Also if one TC hits country Y and kills 100k people and causes billions of damage then tomorrow another hits country Z and kills 100k people and causes billions of damage, it makes little sense to not have both of these on ITN. This is an extreme case and you may say IAR, but what about lesser cases? When do we decide to draw the line? <a href="" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nil Einne">talk</a>) 08:04, 24 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Surely if you want to be looking at top story on news sites you should be choosing a more diverse selection not 3 basically American sites, 1 British and one Canadian. What about Al Jazeera English, South African English news sites, Indian English news sites, Chinese English news sites (Xinhua?), Russian English news sites and perhaps one more generic Asian one and more generic African one (if one exists) and one more generic European one (ditto)? Particularly since there tends to be quite a strong difference in sporting events of interest to North Americans and to most of the rest of the world and you only have one non North American. P.S. I&#39;m presuming of course you looked at www.yahoo.com rather then say in.yahoo.com (which currently has 9/all stories about cricket) and espn.go.com rather then www.espnstar.com which currently has 4 stories about football (the real kind) <a href="" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nil Einne">talk</a>) 13:02, 24 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<dd>Changed to say &#34;a country&#34; instead of &#34;an independent country&#34; because of possible ties to Denmark. Anybody know which is more accurate? -<a href="" title="User:SusanLesch">SusanLesch</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:SusanLesch">talk</a>) 16:16, 2 June 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Greenland already is a country, so saying it <i>will</i> become one is incorrect. Also my understanding of it is that Greenland will become fully independent country within the Danish kingdom, but remain tied to Denmark through foreign policy and the military. As such it would also be incorrect to claim they are truly independent as well. So basically that&#39;s not really helped, has it. I think (but don&#39;t hold me to this) that it will adopt a <a href="" title="Special Administrative Region of the People&#39;s Republic of China">similar link</a> to that which <a href="" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a> and <a href="" title="Macau">Macau</a> have with China, in which case it may be better waiting until the day, when I&#39;m sure the Danish Gov will come up with a fancy name for their new relationship --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 16:34, 2 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>The thing is probably some random guy on the street probably knows one or two female tennis players. I dunno if the women&#39;s tournament is even that well known to begin with.</dd>
<dd>If we&#39;d be having women&#39;s sport on ITN, the most notable ones are all tennis grand slam events, probably 1 or more major golf championship/s, the <a href="" title="FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup">FIFA Women&#39;s World Cup</a>, the <a href="" title="FIBA World Championship for Women">FIBA World Championship for Women</a> and events where women athletes made a breakthrough like <a href="" title="Danica Patrick">Danica Patrick</a> winning one of the IndyCar races last year.

<dd>But surely if we are being &#39;neutral&#39; we should really be putting both up when the tournament in question has two parallel events for men and women at the same time.

<dd>Doesn&#39;t F1 have tons of &#34;parallel&#34; (not really parallel in the sense that the events are co-equal, but in this regard I won&#39;t even say any women&#39;s team events are &#39;co-equal&#39; with their male counterparts) events before the actual GP race? GP2 comes into mind.

<dd>There not really comparable though, because Formula 1 and GP2 are names that refer to the rules, which are in each case different. As far as I&#39;m aware womens and mens cricket as governed by the ICC use the same rules. The only issue here is gender and really in the 21st century that should be the case. Per <a href="" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> it is not are place to say that one is more important than the other. Yes there may be larger viewing figures for the mens tournament and it may be more lucrative for the players, but in every other way they are equal because they represent the top level of the twenty20. --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 16:22, 22 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

The controversys about it are: Greece has been trying to get artifacts for it from the British museum, and the British won&#39;t give them. Also, many greeks don&#39;t like the look of the museum in their neighborhood. The article on this will probably be updated by those who wrote the article.

<dd><b>Comment</b>. I&#39;m not going to push this nomination, but I disagree with the assertion that anything that&#39;s &#34;human interest&#34; should be dismissed.

<dd>I don&#39;t even know how you can compare those two. Fritzl is a lot more international already in that it happened in Europe and you&#39;ve actually heard of it. The Simpson article is supported by references from such international publications as <i>USA Today</i> (the source which claims it has been &#34;described as the most publicized criminal trial in history&#34;) and one or two from <i>The New York Times</i>, CNN, <i>The LA Times</i>... this line is a bit funny for something that was as big outside America as it was within: &#34;and news organizations <i>nationwide</i> quickly instituted rules prohibiting such manipulation&#34;. So no comparison for me whatsoever. --&#60;font face=&#34;serif&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User: Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;can&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User:Candlewicke/List of signatories">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;dle&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="WP:ITN/C">&#38;bull;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:green&#34;&#62;wicke&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 22:02, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I wasn&#39;t saying the dead pilot was as notable as OJ or Fritzl. I was only saying that if we were to ban all &#34;human interest&#34; stories using what appeared to be Daviessimo&#39;s definition of &#34;human interest,&#34; we would be establishing a policy that would ban even stories as notable as OJ or Fritzl when they occur. -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 22:21, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd><b>Comment</b> sorry to resurrect this dead discussion but there&#39;s a big difference between this and <a href="" title="US Airways Flight 1549">US Airways Flight 1549</a>. In the US Airways Flight 1549 case, the plane struck disaster while climbing but the pilot and crew did what they were trained to do in such an emergency and were able to save the crew via a water landing and evacuation but it was still a potentially catastrophic disaster averted. Hence &#34;This emergency ditching and evacuation, with the loss of no lives, is a heroic and unique aviation achievement&#34;. In this case, the pilot died which while sad for the pilot and his family, the co-pilot should should have been able to land the plane by himself presuming nothing went wrong and as it turns out there was a relief pilot in case one of the pilots got tired so there was in fact two pilots and the plane didn&#39;t even need to divert. (I can&#39;t remember if I supported the 1549 or not in any case, but they&#39;re quite different) <a href="" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nil Einne">talk</a>) 16:59, 20 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>I read about a <i>planned</i> speech. I posted the item last night (before somebody else did). I won’t do that again. This morning the speech wasn’t on TV and from what I read on the White House web site reporters weren’t invited. It was just a social function for financial advisors, department heads, and congressional committee members. The list of who attended sounds like they don’t know how to run the financial industry more than the next guy, so maybe it was a prayer luncheon. --<i><a href="" title="User:Chuck Marean">Chuck Marean</a></i> 00:32, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>That may be premature. From what I&#39;ve been reading this is big for Gabon and Africa, at least to merit comparisons as an African version of <a href="" title="Funeral of Pope John Paul II">Funeral of Pope John Paul II</a> (Europe) and <a href="" title="Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan">Death and state funeral of Ronald Reagan</a> (North America) and he was in charge far longer than those two &#38;ndash; longer than the two put together actually(!). So I&#39;m not sure it is fair to dismiss this now unless any future funeral nominations of US Presidents and the like are dismissed with the same haste (which may or may not be the case). This is continually being reported around the world. Note that the source is from Australia and France&#39;s President will be there. It may be an exceptional funeral, we will know by the time the day arrives. We have had Bongo <i>once</i> actually, we had <a href="" title="Talk:2009 Malagasy political crisis">Madagascar</a> thrice in quick succession and I recall two Nepal ITNs within days of each other recently so it is nothing new and not too much to include the same country if that is where events of significance happen. --&#60;font face=&#34;serif&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User: Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;can&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User:Candlewicke/List of signatories">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;dle&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="WP:ITN/C">&#38;bull;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:green&#34;&#62;wicke&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 22:06, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>You can&#39;t compare Gabon to the US. Gabon has 1.4 million people, few of whom speak English and very few of whom use the English-language Wikipedia. The US has 300 million people, almost all of whom speak English and who account for something like 55% of Wikipedia users. And for whatever reason, news from the US is generally of more interest to people in other English-speaking and Wikipedia-using countries than is news from West Africa. -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 01:04, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Please ignore Mwalcoff&#39;s comments, since Pope John Paul II was not an American. (The same irrationality again) But I will still have to oppose, because: 1) I would be against featuring the Pope&#39;s funeral too. Perhaps I am just not a fan of empty rituals - I hate attending even wedding ceremonies. Gay wedding might be slightly more fun to attend though :-D 2) As for having Madagascar thrice in quick succession, I was the one who allowed it thrice, but please don&#39;t use my previous mistake to justify that I can make the same mistake all over again. I was new to the ITN admin job at that time. --<a href="" title="User:BorgQueen">BorgQueen</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:BorgQueen">talk</a>) 03:08, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, I will ignore Mwalcoff&#39;s irrationality for I cannot agree or even begin to work that one out and would almost apologise to anyone from Gabon who ends of reading it. I only used Reagan to appeal to the understanding of any Americans reading this - John Paul and Bongo reigned far longer than he or any US President ever did. Still, I felt it was worth nominating all the same and who knows? Maybe I am right and maybe I am wrong.

<dd>I was referring to Candlewicke&#39;s argument that if we ignore Bongo&#39;s funeral, we should likewise ignore the funeral of an American president. The argument that all heads of state are the same in news value is absurd. If you were the editor of <i><a href="" title="The New York Times">The New York Times</a></i>, would you give the same prominence to the death of the mayor of New York City as you would the death of the mayor of <a href="" title="Weehawken, New Jersey">Weehawken, New Jersey</a>? -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 02:05, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>OK, so Obama <i>maybe</i> has an excuse because of the history surrounding his appointment. But can the same be said for Clinton, Bush, the other Bush... have I forgotten anyone? The irony being that if I have they are probably not worth having their funeral posted... :) But if you post Obama because of the history what about Bongo which is also historic... no I don&#39;t understand the Mwalcoff view on this one. Of course your own President is always going to be more notable than any other. But if I look at it from what I know, well I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true but there is a line near the start of the <a href="" title="Mary McAleese">current Irish President</a>&#39;s article saying &#34;She is Ireland&#39;s second <a href="" title="female president">female president</a> and the world&#39;s first woman to succeed another woman as an elected <a href="" title="head of state">head of state</a>.&#34; I sincerely doubt that will be good enough to have her funeral posted even if it becomes a world event, likewise <a href="" title="Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir">Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir</a>. But are you suggesting that, when or if the time comes, the funerals of each US President should be posted and that the funeral of someone like Bongo shouldn&#39;t? Both of the mayors you speak of above have zero value to me for I have not a clue who either are so I cannot answer that... :) New York is one city, Gabon is a country and population does not come into it (or else you would have to post the deaths of several Chinese people and what about that mayor who was <a class="externallink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8095114.stm" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8095114.stm">dismissed</a> this week? <a href="" title="Shenzhen">Shenzhen</a> has close to 9 million inhabitants which made me think that were this an American city he would not be allowed to go forgotten...) --&#60;font face=&#34;serif&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User: Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;can&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User:Candlewicke/List of signatories">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;dle&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="WP:ITN/C">&#38;bull;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:green&#34;&#62;wicke&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 03:14, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I don&#39;t have an opinion at this point about whether the funeral of an American president should go up on ITN. I was just reacting to your extrapolation that if we make X judgment on Bongo, that means we should make a similar judgment on an American president. My point was you can&#39;t compare the two countries. You can&#39;t say that the president of one country is the same as the president of another country. Different countries have different levels of interest and news value. Even in your own country&#39;s newspapers I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll find a lot more news about the US than about Sweden and a lot more about Sweden than about Equatorial Guinea. -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 04:53, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;m sure Bongo is not just any old leader. In the time he was in charge the US had nine different Presidents if I count correctly... so I <i>have</i> just compared the two countries... to say that his country is too small and shouldn&#39;t really be considered as he must have had an easy job with barely a million people to look after, etc?

<dd>well not that im supporting or opposing the event. i just wanna say that putting it out there that there are 300 million ppl in US and make up 55% readership of wiki is a useless argument for any topic since wikipedia is an encyclopedia which means its supposed to be unbiased and so it is not trying to please its viewers. (If anyone disagrees with that please tell me). Secondly, IMO the only funeral till now notable enough was probably Mother Teresa&#39;s, So for ITN inclusion we should try and match that kind of international support for a funeral. I am not familier with this funeral but if it is getting that kind of recognition internationally then i would support it. otherwise just leave it. <a href="" title="User:Ashishg55">Ashishg55</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ashishg55">talk</a>) 14:39, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>To be honest I&#39;m leaning towards support on this because evidently he is very highly regarded in Africa. There are few living world leaders who could pull in the number of dignitaries that has been the case with Omar Bongo. The only others are probably Margeret Thatcher and Nelson Mandela, with maybe the likes of Fidel Castro (mainly from communist or socialist countries) or Michail Gorbachev as well. In those cases there would be less opposition because people know more about what they did, but really who are we to comment of the effect that Bongo may have had on the African people and continent --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 20:25, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Responding to what Ashishg55 said (which really should be on the discussions page, but no matter): Of course the encyclopedia should try to please its users. What is the alternative? That we should <i>not</i> try to do what users want? That we should thumb our nose at the majority and impose our own personal views of what is important? Wikipedia should be written for the readers and not for the editors. Anyway, I <b>oppose</b> putting the funeral on ITN since we already had the death and it&#39;s a given that the death of a head of state will be followed by a big funeral. And yes, because far more Wikipedia readers are interested in things like US Sen. <a href="" title="John Ensign">John Ensign</a> admitting he had an extramarital affair, which I won&#39;t bother nominating for ITN because I know what will happen. -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 00:43, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<p>Well, it&#39;s the No. 3 story on the AP wire right now, presumably because it might mean the end of the Ensign&#39;s presidential aspirations.

Mitigating against inclusion would be the fact that <i>The New York Times</i> and <i>Washington Post</i> have the story buried on their websites.

<dd>Ya it seems like a waste of time to argue. But i will say one thing Mwalcoff please take it out of ur head that US news is more important than what happens in other countries. because in other countries no one cares as much as u think they do. As always if it aint internationally important or atleast of international interest it will not go up. And international interest is decided by ppl living outside US <a href="" title="User:Ashishg55">Ashishg55</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ashishg55">talk</a>) 03:33, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The key should be how many Wikipedia users are interested in the event, not how many countries are interested in the event. To believe otherwise is to reflect an inherent bias against the US for being a big country and not being divvied up into little ones like Europe. I think individual news events that are of interest to a great many Wikipedia users and serve as good examples of recently updated Wikipedia namespace content should go up, even if the vast majority of interested people live in a single country. We have been ignoring the &#34;international interest&#34; criterion time and again for things like national elections anyway, so we might as well replace it with something that makes more sense. The key is that ITN <i>as a whole</i> remains geographically diverse, that is, that it not be dominated by events from any one country. This is how they do it at <a href="" title="WP:OTD">WP:OTD</a> (On this day), where they have some stuff from the US, some from the UK, some from other English-speaking countries and some from the rest of the world. Not every event on OTD is &#34;international&#34; -- for example, today they have the 1994 arrest of O.J. Simpson. But OTD as a whole is geographically diverse. I don&#39;t see why some people get so hung up about ITN suggestions. Why does it bother them if something goes up on ITN that they don&#39;t personally have an interest in? I don&#39;t give a damn about the BRIC summit but I don&#39;t demand that it be taken down. There&#39;s room enough to include lots of people&#39;s suggestions. -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 05:13, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Mwalcoff, will you please read the article on the English language. Yes the US is the largest country were it is a primary language but there are over 50 countries worldwide were it is an official language and anywhere up to 1.5 billion people who have a degree of command over the language. If you disagree with those facts then I suggest you set up a website called Americopedia, where you can list as many trivial US news items as you like --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 07:24, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>OTD is not like ITN... there is only so many things that happened OTD whereas there are 100 maybe 1000s of news events that take place all over the world. We pick maybe 2 a day.

I&#39;ve heard this 55% of wikipedia users before and always presumed it has some merit, way more then the largest first language claim anyway (which so far, I&#39;ve never seen explained why only first language matter). But now I find out not only is this apparently based on 2-3 year old statistics, but it&#39;s based on anonymous IP contributions?????? Has it occured to anyone that perhaps if your English level is moderate, you might be more reluctant to contribute to wikipedia, even if you regularly read it???

<dd>Oppose: First, I fear this mention is too US-centric and not of any larger global significance. Second, I don&#39;t think stating the switch has been &#34;completed&#34; is quite accurate: do we know for a fact that <i>all</i> broadcasters in the country made the switch? Certainly not all televisions have been properly fitted to receive the digital signals, which could also be seen as an incomplete switch. --<a href="" title="User:ZimZalaBim">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Zim&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;darkgreen&#34;&#62;<b>Zala</b>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Bim&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:ZimZalaBim">talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 01:34, 13 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>The Gay’s probably don’t want their name used that way, and Jews and Christians probably don’t want the rainbow used that way either. She’s on the front page of this morning’s paper. I think the issue is: since when are the girls in a beauty contest applying for a job? In the current events, someone re-wrote it to make the “contractual obligations” sound normal, and also added the word “stripped.” Someone not signed in later removed the news, so I will again point out that the news is on the front page of this morning’s newspaper. -- <i><a href="" title="User:Chuck Marean">Chuck Marean</a></i> 20:21, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>My point was that her getting fired is a current event, and yet somebody once again removed what I put in current events from current events (I think because I&#39;m not an admin). I was hinting that maybe an admin with allys might like to put it back into the current events. My joke about the last name and the rainbow was not my point. However, in the bible the rainbow means God’s attempt to control his temper, since it’s a sign in the story of  Noah’s Ark that he won’t drown everyone again. Or is that too off the subject? --<i><a href="" title="User:Chuck Marean">Chuck Marean</a></i> 21:09, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I can only speculate. If the rainbow is a sign that God won&#39;t drown everyone again then that is positive surely?

<dd>Two thing I would point out. Firstly this transfer is not completed yet so it hasn&#39;t broken any record yet. Secondly and in relation to Candlewickes point I personally don&#39;t believe this record will be beaten any time soon because there is probably only one player who would command a higher fee (<a href="" title="Lionel Messi">Lionel Messi</a>). Also during the period in question you mention there was reckless spending by big Italian clubs, which is also never likely to be repeated so I don&#39;t think we can use that period to prove the rule.

<dd>Could everyone check out the Romanian football story under the previous day and judge it for its own individual merits? One of the points I made about it is that it seems to be a one-off and, unlike the transfers, hasn&#39;t changed today. It is also being reported in Canada which I found strange as I wasn&#39;t aware that the sport was very popular in that country.

<dd>Not really.

<dd>I&#39;m sure it is far more notable than the interim president of Gabon to 90% of Wikipedia&#39;s readership. The fact is this has been a <i>huge</i> story all day in the American media, and there is no reason that, since the US accounts for the vast majority of native English speakers and roughly half of Wikipedia users, that US items should not appear at least <i>sometimes</i> on ITN. We should be basing ITN entries on what is literally &#34;in the news&#34; and what articles are good examples of recently updated content, <i>not</i> on your or BorgQueen&#39;s biased views on what&#39;s really important. If you have a problem with this story being so prominent, you should take it up with CNN, The New York Times, the BBC, the Associated Press and the thousands of other news sources that have made it prominent, and the millions of real people out there who must think it&#39;s a pretty damn notable story. -- <a href="" title="User:Mwalcoff">Mwalcoff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mwalcoff">talk</a>) 02:57, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Well Susan Boyle was quite a prominent story too, as was Anna Nicole Smith&#39;s death and a number of celebrity meltdowns as well as stuff about the new year during the new year and currently flight 447 is perpetually prominent and to a lesser extent H1N1 and North Korea. Although I believe you may support these stories, I&#39;m somewhat doubtful we&#39;d hear the end of it if we put them on ITN. Incidentally, US stories appear quite frequently on ITN. And as you well know, the name ITN is a poor choice of name. BTW, the vast majority of English speakers do not even use the internet. There&#39;s no reason to restrict ourselves to native speakers. P.S. The top 3 story on CNN at the moment is &#34;Miss California USA Prejean dethroned&#34; while the most read (I think) story on Fox News &#34;Exclusive: Miss California Carrie Prejean Loses Her Crown&#34;, meanwhile the 7th most read on Fox News is &#34;Woman Mistakenly Junks Mattress With $1 Million Inside&#34; while on BBC World &#34;Israel woman &#39;bins $1m mattress&#39;&#34; is number 10.

<dd>And the Amerocentric view comes up. Look, this is the English version of Wikipedia. Not the English as a First Language version. A great number of people in this world speak English now; it has become the lingua franca of the twenty-first century to some extent. To suggest that the United States is above the others is a self-centred image. American stories are still frequently put on ITN but they needn&#39;t always be. If there isn&#39;t a significant American occurrence for a few weeks, it doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;ve been forgotten. All changes in state leadership are notable by their very nature, regardless of their political power. And frankly, every time something new happens, CNN, AP and BBC put it on their main page. For example on the BBC home page right now. <a class="externallink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8094420.stm" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8094420.stm">See?</a> As a final note, I&#39;d like to impress that Wikipedia isn&#39;t like the other news sources because it isn&#39;t one (as I&#39;m sure you knew, candlewickle).

<dd>I&#39;m going to <b>Oppose</b> as well. The Superbowl, World Series and NBA Final are only included because they are the highest levels of their respective sports. Football is a truly global sport so its not possible to make a direct comparisons. Romanian football is <a href="#Current_ranking" title="UEFA coefficient">only ranked 9th in Europe</a> and when South American leagues are factored in its will probably be even lower. If this goes up then in the interests of fairness you&#39;ll have to start putting things up from England or Argentina or Turkey --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 13:24, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Also I think we have to be wary of the population claim because the CL has changed so much in the last 15 years its hard to find comparisons. For example <a href="" title="Floriana F.C.">Floriana F.C.</a> and <a href="" title="Íþróttabandalag Akraness">Íþróttabandalag Akraness</a> have both qualified for the CL proper (i.e. not a qualifying or preliminary round) and they come from towns with smaller populations. However, because the format has changed, they have never technically played in the group stage, although in reality they got to same stage as Unirea Urziceni. When they qualified they had two knockout rounds prior to the group stage, as opposed to now where the groups preceed the knockout rounds --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 13:49, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>(unindent) If you read my post you would see that I explained the issue above. They reached the first proper stage of the CL just like Unirea but when they did it the first stages were knockout rounds rather than groups (it is this factor that makes the claim hard to verify). The reality is that interest wise this item is very localised and beyond Romania there will be little or no interest. The claims need to be supported with reliable sources that can be verified. In one you state they are the first town to qualify, which is completely false with clubs from towns such as <a href="" title="Thun">Thun</a>, <a href="" title="Auxerre">Auxerre</a>, <a href="" title="Blackburn">Blackburn</a> and many more having qualified before --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 14:19, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I updated the article earlier but have just come back now. I&#39;m not really sure why each country ought to be included. For instance, I was unaware that that England or Argentina or Turkey regard their versions as their Superbowl, however this seems to be the case with Romania. And who are the English or Americans to tell the Romanians what sport they should choose to follow? But apart from that, the story of the team itself is also fairly exceptional, they seem to have beaten a former CL <i>winner</i> to win this competition and have come from nowhere as a small-town club with a few thousand fans who weren&#39;t even in the competition three years ago. I&#39;m not sure how often this happens in the world of football but the more I read it the more I am convinced to <b> still support</b>. It is a complete contrast to all the money being thrown around at one player in the other football nominations we&#39;ve had recently - there are at least two examples of that this week, this is the only one of a team. Also, if someone could tell me why someone in <a href="" title="The Canadian Press">The Canadian Press</a> is interested in <a class="externallink" href="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jonZkdJKKVS0w8-0l9kOMzYqhZQw" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5jonZkdJKKVS0w8-0l9kOMzYqhZQw">writing an entire report</a> on their exploits, that would be much appreciated - I am not overly familiar with <a href="" title="Canada-Romania relations">Canada-Romania relations</a> (the link is rather bare). This story seems to meet the criteria of being covered internationally - the fact that it&#39;s not at <a href="" title="WP:ITNR">WP:ITNR</a> is no reason to omit it as it isn&#39;t a rock-solid policy and I believe someone previously suggested that more football stories were needed anyway. Here is a one-off story which need not be recurring - it is not too much to post Romania one year and not post it the next. --&#60;font face=&#34;serif&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User: Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;can&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User:Candlewicke/List of signatories">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;dle&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="WP:ITN/C">&#38;bull;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:green&#34;&#62;wicke&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 17:17, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Well just off the top of my head you have <a href="" title="TSG 1899 Hoffenheim">Hoffenheim</a> or <a href="" title="ChievoVerona">ChievoVerona</a> who are &#39;small&#39; town clubs that have managed to at times compete with the big boys in recent seasons. The reason I&#39;m opposed to this is because, the claims made by the nominator don&#39;t appear to be true. I&#39;ve already provided examples of other town clubs that have got to the same stage and also shown that in the mid 1990s very small towns (i.e. &#60;10,000 people) have been represented. That leaves the notability of them winning the league, which is IMHO not notable. Also this year you&#39;ve had <a href="" title="VfL Wolfsburg">Wolfsburg</a> winning their first ever <a href="" title="Bundesliga">Bundesliga</a> or <a href="" title="AZ Alkmaar">AZ Alkmaar</a> who have broken the hegemony of the big three Dutch clubs by becoming the first non <a href="" title="Ajax">Ajax</a>, <a href="" title="Feyenoord">Feyenoord</a> or <a href="" title="PSV">PSV</a> side to win the <a href="" title="Eredivisie">Eredivisie</a> since the early 1980s.

<dd>Just to clarify, because there seems to be confusion earlier in the debate, this competition is in no way similar to the Superbowl. The superbowl is the top level of American Football in the world bar none and that is why it is included. The top level of club football is technically the <a href="" title="World Club Championship">World Club Championship</a>, which is the only global team competition in football. Below this you then have regional football tournaments such as the <a href="" title="Copa America">Copa America</a> or <a href="" title="Champions League">Champions League</a>, which are in reality more highly regarded than the CWC and this is why they are recurring items (not even all of them when in reality they all should be). It is by winning this that you qualify for the CWC. Below this level you then have your domestic leagues, which are each governed by a regional football body. European Leagues are generally regarded as the best in the world led by the big three of Italy, Spain and England. UEFA ranks the leagues based on performance in Europe, which dictates qualification for European football tournaments (see <a href="" title="UEFA coefficient">UEFA coefficient</a>)</dd>
<dd>This nomination is about a team who has won the Romanian national championship, which is only ranked 9th in Europe by UEFA. This entitles them to automatic qualification to the Champions League along with 16 other sides. They will in turn be joined by 16 others who must first go through qualifying. When you consider this you can see how low in relative terms this competition falls in the football pyramid (below 8 other leagues in Europe &#60; regional international team comps &#60; world club championship). Thus IMHO opinion this isn&#39;t a notable enough achievement in the big scheme of things. I&#39;ve provided examples of similarly notable events that have occured this season in other leagues and somewhere in the world these sought of things happen every season. There is nothing that makes this achievement stand out --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 18:11, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I agree and still support as I haven&#39;t seen anything in the above to make me change my mind, it certainly is big for Romania and has crossed countries and oceans to Canada. Did the winning teams from Holland and Germany rise from the smaller leagues three seasons previously? And did the teams competing with &#34;the big boys&#34; actually beat them and <i>win</i> their entire competition? A first since the early eighties versus a first ever?! How can there not be only one winner of that argument?

<dd>(edit conflict) But the focus of this is on the entire story... it isn&#39;t just about a qualification for something next season. That happens all the time everywhere anyway, doesn&#39;t it? :) That&#39;s just a bonus. It&#39;s more about them rising from nowhere and being the subject of reports outside their own country. You&#39;ve also added another contradiction to the tale - so teams from eastern Europe don&#39;t do well in the CL at all? Why that would make this all the more immense - this team has come from nowhere in three years and beaten a team who achieved something remarkable themselves at their own game? OK, they drew but they still won overall if you know what I mean. It&#39;s about the achievement at ITN, isn&#39;t it, not the score?

<dd>Football back in the 1980s was a very different proposition. For starters the whole competition was a knockout system which small team had a better chance of getting through to the next round. Also, back then only the league champions qualified so there were less &#39;hard&#39; teams to play. Today the top 3/4 teams from Italy, Spain and England as well as top 2/3 teams from Germany anf France qualify making the tournament much more competitive. If you Compare the route that Steaua took from the last 16 to the final there opposition were <a href="" title="Budapest Honvéd FC">Budapest Honvéd FC</a>, <a href="" title="Kuusysi">Kuusysi</a>, <a href="" title="Anderlecht">Anderlecht</a> and <a href="" title="Barcelona">Barcelona</a>. Compare that to Barcelona this year <a href="" title="Olympique Lyonnais">Lyon</a>, <a href="" title="Bayern Munich">Bayern Munich</a>, <a href="" title="Chelsea">Chelsea</a> and <a href="" title="Manchester United">Manchester United</a>. Also back in the 80s the Eastern European teams were bankrolled by Communist regimes. All the prefixes such as <a href="" title="CSKA">CSKA</a> (Army), <a href="" title="Dynamo Sports Club">Dinamo</a> (secret police), <a href="" title="Lokomotiv (sports society)">Locomotiv</a> (railways) etc defines who they were linked to and that is why these clubs were able to compete with the big powers. When communism collapsed the teams lost their funding streams and slipped out of the limelight. Hence Steaua today is absolutely no match for the Steaua of 20 years. Admitedlly some sides are returning particularly in Russia and Ukraine, but again this is only because of big money backers (particularly from oil). You are taking these things as things to support your argument but in reality they highlight how much football in places like Romania has deteriated since the collapse of communism, which explains how it is possible for smaller clubs to compete in these leagues --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 20:13, 11 June 2009 (UTC) </dd></dl></dd>

<dd>Bringing in the Communists has meant straying from the point at hand. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s fair to automatically associate Communism with Romania when a non-political Romanian ITN is nominated. This is a separate team, separate competition and this is twenty-three years later so if there are further comments it would be best to stick to the point and the present day. I would also say that Monaco also has a Grand Prix and an annual ITN so very difficult to compare Romania with Monaco. Monaco has money and, if TouLouse is correct, this team don&#39;t if it must be put bluntly.

<dd>The sad reality is that bombings of this sort are hardly uncommon in Iraq and are generally for that reason not of significant international interest. To some extent, this applies in Pakistan as well and I believe there&#39;s been a few which have been proposed and we ignored for that reason but it&#39;s not quite the Iraq situation yet and this one had unique characteristics. Bombings in many other parts of the world though are of greater significance, for example even one killing 5 people in Hong Kong, Paris, Durban, Havana, or Apia is likely to be of sufficient significance for ITN. <a href="" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nil Einne">talk</a>) 07:07, 11 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>To be honest I&#39;m thinking it might be best to leave this anyway. The problem is that because when Zidane moved back in 2001, the euro had only been around for two years and was still highly unstable. This meant that in comparison to the <a href="" title="USD">USD</a> and <a href="" title="Pound Sterling">Pound Sterling</a> it was relatively poorly valued. Over the years the Euro has strengthened, particularly against the pound, which has left a very odd situation were this transfer is worth more when valued by the pound, but is actually worth less when valued against the euro. To put in another way the value of the Euro against the pound has risen by about 20% from about 0.70 £/euro to about 0.86 £/euro today, meaning that the number of euros to a pound has fallen. Anyway to cut this story short we put this item up and you have one of two possabilities
<dl>
<dd>(1) You say its a world record and people complain saying its not a record when measured by the euro, due to an appreciation in the value of the euro over the last eight years</dd>
<dd>(2) You say it is a record in £, but then get a load of complaints that its a biased story (because it makes out that the pound is more important than the euro)</dd></dl></dd>

<dd>Both transfers were conducted in Euros, therefore a direct comparison of the two transfer fees is possible in that currency.  The fact that the relative values of sterling and the Euro have changed in the meantime does not affect the result of these transfers on the size of the payment made, and therefore Zidane&#39;s remains the higher transfer fee.  As an aside, I would reject the suggestion that the Euro was inherently unstable even when it was new: it had been tied to the DM for some years previously, and that was scarcely a lightweight currency.  <a href="" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kevin McE">talk</a>) 17:45, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I thought I had just explained that. If you choose to compare frankly irrelevant sterling equivalents to the transfer fees negotiated and settled in Euro, today&#39;s is the largest, but if you compare the amounts in Euro, which is what both clubs involved will do, it is about 15% less than Zidane&#39;s. <a href="" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kevin McE">talk</a>) 18:03, 9 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>(unindent) Most sources are actually putting the transfer fee for Kaka at £59m or €68m. I don&#39;t see how you can assert that valuing the transfer in Pounds is irrelevant.

<dd>I am not going to propose the deletion of those articles and tables that compare transfers in sterling, although why sterling is considered more valid than the franc, mark lira or peseta for the pre-unification era is unclear.  But there obviously <b>is</b> a currency to accurately compare transfers between clubs in the Eurozone in the last 8 years, and that is what is relevant for these two transfers.  It seems ridiculous to post this as the world&#39;s biggest transfer, when Real Madrid&#39;s books will show that it&#39;s not even a club record.  <a href="" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kevin McE">talk</a>) 18:47, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>why are we taking currency exchange/inflation in consideration to begin with. If the news source suggests that its the largest then its the largest. We should not be converting by ourselves. Just to take example i know we dont posts record box office for movies but lets assume for a second that we do. Then if u look at box office figures from 70s or 40s and add the inflation value then u would never post any movie ever again. Now the argument should really be do we wanna post a player movement. since there is no guarantee there might be another one equally large next week. <a href="" title="User:Ashishg55">Ashishg55</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ashishg55">talk</a>) 20:16, 9 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Not really: that party have 21 less MEPs than they had yesterday! That is largely because of a reduction in the number of seats, but they have a decrease from 36.1% of the parliament to 35.7%.  The centre right was fairly generally successful, although many of that ilk are no longer aligned with EPP.

<dd>I am not going to accept &#34;Parties of the centre right gain in Europe&#39;s parliamentary election according to exit polls with the voter turnout at a record low of 43 percent&#34;, since even you admitted that is only correct in some countries.

<dd>Well I hope you are not content with leaving up something that is demonstrably untrue, even if that is the summary of someone at the portal.  How about <i>Parties of the centre right gain in the Europe Union&#39;s parliamentary election, with the voter turnout at a record low of 43 percent</i>? <a href="" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kevin McE">talk</a>) 17:43, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I don&#39;t want the current version to change. Of course the left made gains in some cases, but just like any election that happens. The European Parliament is one whole body, so it doesn&#39;t matter if one country (Greece and Sweden for example) were an exemption. The general swing is definately to the centre-right as reported by all major news reports. <b>&#60;font color=&#34;#00824A&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Jolly Janner">Jolly</a>&#60;/font&#62; &#60;font color=&#34;#2A5FFF&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Jolly Janner">Ω</a>&#60;/font&#62; &#60;font color=&#34;#00824A&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Jolly Janner">Janner</a>&#60;/font&#62;</b> 18:05, 8 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>I know that this isn&#39;t on INT/R but to have theatre be unrepresented in ITN would be an absolute travesty in my opinion. When they occur, I plan on nominating the Laurence Olivier Awards too, so I have no intention of making this Amerocentric. They are two are the highest awards for a very old and still very influential art form. I also know that the ITN will be clogged with so many other, arguably more important things. However, should we really let the ITN be nothing but politics? Therefore I nominate: </li></ul>

<dd>I admire your will to have theatre represented but the <a href="" title="Laurence Olivier Awards">Laurence Olivier Awards</a> are &#34;the highest honour in British theatre and are considered to be the theatre industry equivalent of the BAFTA Awards for television and film... given for West End shows and other productions staged in London&#34;. Now if no other country were prepared to contest this and dismiss Broadway and the West End as the home of theatre that would probably be fine but I wonder if that would be the case?

<dd>Theaters are meant to be local since you have to watch them live. It actually wouldnt make sense for an international award. Movies are a little different as they can be seen by anyone in the world instantly. But as Candlewicke said there are other big awards for theater that have not been included so if we include Tony in ITNR we will have to look at all the other ones too.

<dd><b>Wait</b> We shouldn&#39;t be putting up placeholders: we refer to mature articles relevant to current events, and in the case of elections, that means results. However, even when the results are in, a headline might be difficult to frame. There is no victorious party leader, no government to form. The groupings that MEPs belong to have no high profile in the voting nations, and results tend to reflect the popularity, or lack of it, of the incumbent government in each member state. A substantial shift to left or right might be worth recording if it happens, but that seems unlikely. <a href="" title="User:Kevin McE">Kevin McE</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kevin McE">talk</a>) 19:13, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I think the 2,000 figure being thrown around is for the party at the end. This figure includes people from within and without China. I think 2,000 gay people gathering in China is notable but I suppose you are welcome to disagree. It is still happening in a highly metropolitan city so plenty more may join in and if not it is still happening around them. This has nothing to do with the Puerto Rican nom. As it happens I would agree with that item but it was a Presidential nom and not a confirmation which was taking it much too far... the Tea Party protest is a bit too local however... --&#60;font face=&#34;serif&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User: Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;can&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User:Candlewicke/List of signatories">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;dle&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="WP:ITN/C">&#38;bull;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:green&#34;&#62;wicke&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 18:00, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>What&#39;s the purpose of having protests, anyway? To make the government revise its policies. If there are too few protesters the government will just ignore them.

<dd>Please read up on China&#39;s record on this matter. And why should they <i>all</i> be gay? The event itself is symbolic. I highly doubt they will hook everyone up to some sort of machine to determine their level of gayness and then shout a big statistical announcement with percentages and fractions from the rooftops. I wonder how they could even do this in theory. If there are &#34;heterosexual sympathizers in there&#34; it will not affect the integrity of the event. And how do you know that they are definitely not all gay? Has China discovered a method to reduce its numbers of gay people? It has a much higher population than the US so it would be fair to say that it has more gay people than that country too. Certainly there aren&#39;t less than 2,000 gay people in China unless something has gone wrong somewhere... --&#60;font face=&#34;serif&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User: Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;can&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User:Candlewicke/List of signatories">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;dle&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="WP:ITN/C">&#38;bull;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:green&#34;&#62;wicke&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 18:42, 7 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>OK coming back to this event. Nadal lost and Federer is now in the final. I know we got our little template like message for these events where we say who won. but &#34;IF (fingers crossed)&#34; federer wins this final it will not be your normal grand slam final anymore. THis will be a defining moment in tennis history. I dont even think i need to explain why. So the blurb should really say federer wins his first french open and ties pete sampras for all time grand slam record. <a href="" title="User:Ashishg55">Ashishg55</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ashishg55">talk</a>) 19:06, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I never heard of it before. That&#39;s why I thought it would be good for June 6 to report that Europe has a Parliment.

<dd>I would however counter that by saying that first time discoveries or events such as this are often featured on ITN, that ITN (and indeed Wikipedia) is not a newspaper and items are not posted based upon their position in a newspaper, that 2000 new colour photographs of someone with one of the most recognisable names on the planet is certainly significant. And I can see calls for oppose or removal based upon the man himself but the usual <a href="" title="WP:CENSOR">WP:CENSOR</a> ought to surely apply and if we&#39;re so afraid of him in the first place we might have to delete his article as well and that big, frightful photo in his infobox to save the kids from reliving their worst nightmares, etc, etc... DYK had breasts last month, there&#39;s no reason why ITN can&#39;t have Hitler this month... I don&#39;t know why people would logically call for its removal otherwise... the US ought to recognise the name, the UK and the rest of Europe ought to as well so there should be no cross-Atlantic rows of importance like with the Obama speech... also if people are going to call for removal they ought to come here in the first place when these nominations are being decided rather than give such inconvenience to BorgQueen afterwards... sometimes I wonder if they pick on ITN so much because they know there are so few people around... --&#60;font face=&#34;serif&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User: Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;can&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User:Candlewicke/List of signatories">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;dle&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="WP:ITN/C">&#38;bull;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Candlewicke">&#60;span style=&#34;color:green&#34;&#62;wicke&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 16:23, 6 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>This is exactly what I was talking about when I made my post on the discussion page called &#34;Commenting on events from a position of ignorance.&#34; If you don&#39;t know who Randy Johnson is and don&#39;t know why 300 wins is such a milestone, you shouldn&#39;t knock the suggestion. There has been a tremendous amount of commentary about Johnson&#39;s achievement in the North American sports world because it is thought that given today&#39;s baseball strategies, he might be the last person ever to get to 300 wins. Let the people who are aware of the event&#39;s significance debate whether it merits inclusion on ITN.

<dd>The Cabinet changes shouldn&#39;t be included in the blurb.

Defence (which also changed) is a large post, but not considered a <a href="" title="Great Offices of State">Great Office of State</a>. If we had received the expected outcome with changes at the Home, the Treasury and possibly even Foreign and Justice in addition to Defence or maybe Brown&#39;s resignation as party leader and prime minister, I&#39;d certainly support.

<dt>Peru clashes</dt></dl>
At least 31 (22 civilians and nine police) are killed by clashes between indigenous people and security forces in Peru.  The deaths occurred as the authorities tried to break up a road blockade.  Blockades have been instigated by the indigenous tribes for the past two months in protest against new laws which they say will make it easier for companies to exploit their land.  Perhaps the death toll is not high enough (though it is high  for what has been called a &#34;peaceful campaign&#34;) but it is certainly worth considering and worth keeping an eye on for future developments.  <a class="externallink" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8086595.stm" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/8086595.stm">(BBC)</a> - <a href="" title="User:Dumelow">Dumelow</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dumelow">talk</a>) 22:49, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

It was the most anticipated speech of the year. Millions watched it all over the world, and the speech is considered by analysts to have marked a major shift in the relationship between the United States (1st world power) and the Muslim world (more than 1 billion people). Certainly not an ordinary state visit. Tons of reliable sources and media coverage. It is certainly more <i>in the news</i> than any of the other items currently listed.

<dd>It <i>could</i> mark the beginning of a new doctrine?  I thought we didn&#39;t deal in speculation?  I have read my comment yesterday and just in case it didn&#39;t come off as the oppose I intended I would like to make it clear that I oppose this and am in favour of removing it from the main page.  It seems strange that this should be put up whilst other heads of state (who must make similarly elegant and well worded speeches everyday) would not have a cat in hell&#39;s chance of their speeches being posted.  Yes, it was a nice speech and yes, it was covered by media across the world but our own article has just one short paragraph on the content and (to me) it doesn&#39;t seem to have promised much.

<dd>I also going to have to <b>oppose</b>. My argument would be if Obama gave a speech to the European people, through the European parliament that wouldn&#39;t be notable so why is this. The whole reason this has gained so much attention is because of his PR team, who are trying to make out he&#39;s this really nice guy who&#39;s going to solve the world problems. That may turn out to be true, but as it stands nothing has changed, all the disputes remain, all the barriers to dialogue still remain, the Taliban and Al Queda are still intent on blowing westerners up and Iran and half the rest of the middle east still wants to nuke Israel off the map. Realistically this should put this one small should speech in perspective --<a href="" title="User:Daviessimo">Daviessimo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daviessimo">talk</a>) 08:16, 5 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>What do you mean by &#39;bigger scheme&#39; of things? The contract value is hugely variable because of the fact the contract is owned by someone else. If a player moves on a <a href="" title="Bosman ruling">Bosman</a>, then the transfer fee would be zero and so they can demand a larger windfall, which is usually provided through signing on fees. Arguably this is what makes football so unique and contract and transfer values so volatile. Generally speaking, however, the transfer fee is bigger because contracts tend to be longer for better players, meaning more compensation is needed to buy out their current deal. Its very hard to explain in the terms you want because its never done in that way.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Soderling_knocks_Nadal_out_of_French_Open">Soderling knocks Nadal out of French Open</span></h4>
&#60;small&#62;From <a href="" title="Talk:Main Page">Talk:Main Page</a>&#60;/small&#62;
Sweden&#39;s Robin Soderling pulled off one of the biggest <a class="externallink" href="http://www.watches-space.com/Omega-Watches/Speedmaster-Watches.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.watches-space.com/Omega-Watches/Speedmaster-Watches.html">Speedmaster Watches</a> upsets in Grand Slam tennis, ending four-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal&#39;s perfect record at Roland Garros with a 6-2, 6-7 (2), 6-4, 7-6 (2) win. 
&#34;I didn&#39;t want him to make me run. I tried to be the one that made him run,&#34; said the 24-year-old Soderling. &#34;I worked good with my forehand, and my backhand worked well, as well. I worked my backhand flat and tried to go around and hit my forehand.&#34; 
Nadal had never lost at Roland Garros, heading into the match <a class="externallink" href="http://www.watches-space.com/Omega-Watches/Speedmaster-Broad-Arrow-Watches.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.watches-space.com/Omega-Watches/Speedmaster-Broad-Arrow-Watches.html">Speedmaster Broad Arrow Watches</a> with a 31-0 record and four titles to his name, and Soderling was unable to win a set during their two pervious meetings. 
Nadal&#39;s shock exit boosted Swiss star Roger Federer&#39;s chance of winning his first Roland Garros tournament. 
Federer, seeking a record-equalling 14th grand slam title, takes <a class="externallink" href="http://www.watches-space.com/Omega-Watches/Speedmaster-Day-Watches.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.watches-space.com/Omega-Watches/Speedmaster-Day-Watches.html">Speedmaster Day Watches</a> on Tommy Haas of Germany in Monday&#39;s fourth-round match, while next on Soderling&#39;s path will be Russian 10th seed Nikolay 
Davydenko, who thrashed Spanish eighth seed Fernando Verdasco 6-2, 6-2, 6-4.  &#60;small&#62;&#60;span class=&#34;autosigned&#34;&#62;—Preceding <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="" title="User:Landylin">Landylin</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Landylin">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Landylin">contribs</a>) 07:54, 2 June 2009 (UTC)&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;!-- Template:Unsigned --&#62; &#60;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&#62;
