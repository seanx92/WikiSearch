&#60;!-- Please don&#39;t edit anything above here; just include your reasons for nominating below. --&#62;</p>
<p>I am nominating this for featured article because a lot of hard work has gone into this article to make it as comprehensive on the subject as possible. It has achieved a GA status and I believe that it can achieve FA status as well. <a href="" title="User:J.D.">J.D.</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:J.D.">talk</a>) 15:38, 23 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>&#34;The film is slated for DVD release in the UK on June 29, 2009.&#34; Is there no Blu-ray being released? If there is, consider rewording to home media release. Also, a home media release should be mentioned beyond the lead.</li></ul>

<li>I&#39;m not sure on the guidelines for this, but different dashes are used in the multiple quotes in the article. I think they&#39;re supposed to be consistent throughout the article, such as using &#38;mdash; instead of --. Be sure to check, because I may be wrong.</li></ul>

<p>The article is well-written and covers the film well. Hopefully the above comments are helpful, and if you disagree with any of them, feel free to state your rationale. Good work so far. --Happy editing! <a href="" title="User:Nehrams2020">Nehrams2020</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nehrams2020">talk</a> â€¢ <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Nehrams2020">contrib</a>) 17:24, 23 June 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p><b>Oppose, recommend peer review</b> Article is pretty close, but there are some issues:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The article relies heavily on the Cannes film festival program as a source. While Cannes is a high-profile event, I&#39;m not sure that a pamphlet is an appropriate source for a featured article, since it was never really published and it&#39;s not even clear who wrote/edited it.</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>Well, other film articles have relied on Presskits and Production Notes for sources of info and those anonymously written but I think just as valid. I would say that you might have a valid point if the bulk of the source material came from it but the article also cites Amy Taubin&#39;s two articles extensively as well as Michael Guillen&#39;s and Ben Kenigsberg&#39;s articles.--<a href="" title="User:J.D.">J.D.</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:J.D.">talk</a>) 15:52, 25 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<li>The article switches between the names &#34;Che&#34; and &#34;Guevara&#34; to refer to the subject of the film.</li></ul>

<li>&#34;Del Toro confessed he had previously only thought of Guevara as a &#34;bad guy&#34; since he was a child.&#34; &#34;Confessed&#34; is a very strong word here. &#34;Previously&#34; and &#34;since he was a child&#34; shouldn&#39;t be used together.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>&#34;Additionally Del Toro read Don Quixote, one of Guevara&#39;s favorites, and the first book published and given out free after the Cuban Revolution.&#34; This appears to come from the <i>Telegraph</i> article, but it&#39;s cited to the <i>Backstage</i> article. You don&#39;t need all these &#34;also&#34; and &#34;additionally&#34; words.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>&#34;Del Toro then personally met with people from different stages of Guevara&#39;s life, including Guevara&#39;s younger brother and childhood friends in Argentina.&#34; &#34;Research also included traveling to Cuba where Del Toro met Che&#39;s widow, family, and &#34;tons of people that loved this man&#34;. These appear to be describing the same incident. The first source doesn&#39;t mention Argentina specifically so I think these should be combined.</li></ul>

<li>The modified quote &#34;bucketful(s) of love&#34; should have []s, not ()s, but I recommend just using the original wording since there&#39;s no way to define a bucketful of love anyway.</li></ul>

<li>&#34;...collaborating with the three surviving guerrillas from Guevara&#39;s ill-fated Bolivian campaign, and with several guerrillas who fought alongside him in Cuba. While researching for both films, Soderbergh made a documentary of his interviews with many who had fought alongside Che in both Cuba and Bolivia.&#34; Were these different events? The wording &#34;fought alongside ... in&#34; shouldn&#39;t be used two sentences in a row.</li></ul>

<p>That&#39;s just the first two paragraphs; I&#39;m gonna leave it there for now. As the first two sentences are plagiarized I&#39;m hesitant to critique the rest of the article. I see this was peer reviewed in February; I think it should be peer reviewed a second time. Content-wise the article looks great, but there seem to be a lot of minor nitpicks like these that need to be cleaned up before we can address the real FA issues. â€”<a href="" title="User:Noisalt">Noisalt</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Noisalt">talk</a>) 20:47, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
