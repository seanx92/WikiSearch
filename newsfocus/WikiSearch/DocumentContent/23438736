<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>
<p>Olive Penderghast (<a href="" title="Emma Stone">Emma Stone</a>) lies to her best friend Rhiannon (<a href="" title="Alyson Michalka">Alyson Michalka</a>) about going on a date in order to get out of camping with Rhi&#39;s hippie parents. Instead, she hangs around the house all weekend listening to <a href="" title="Natasha Bedingfield">Natasha Bedingfield</a>&#39;s &#34;<a href="" title="Pocketful of Sunshine">Pocketful of Sunshine</a>&#34;.  The following Monday, pressed by Rhiannon, Olive lies about losing her virginity to a college guy. Marianne (<a href="" title="Amanda Bynes">Amanda Bynes</a>), a strictly religious girl at their school, overhears her telling the lie and soon it spreads like wildfire. The school&#39;s conservative church group run by Marianne decides Olive will be their next project.</p> 
<p>Olive confides the truth to her friend Brandon (<a href="" title="Dan Byrd">Dan Byrd</a>), and he explains how others bully him because he&#39;s <a href="" title="gay">gay</a>. Brandon later asks Olive to pretend to sleep with him so that he will be accepted by everyone. Brandon convinces Olive and they pretend to have sex at a party.</p>
<p>After having a fight with Rhiannon over Olive&#39;s new identity as a &#34;dirty skank&#34;, Olive decides to counteract the harassment by embracing her new image as the school tramp. She begins to wear more provocative clothing and stitches a red &#39;A&#39; (similar to Hester Prynne in <i>The Scarlet Letter</i>) to everything she wears. Boys who usually have had no luck with girls in the past beg Olive to say they have had sex with her in order to increase their own popularity, in exchange for money, in turn increasing her reputation.</p>
<p>Things get worse when Micah (<a href="" title="Cam Gigandet">Cam Gigandet</a>), Marianne&#39;s 22-year-old boyfriend, contracts <a href="" title="Chlamydia infection">chlamydia</a> from sleeping with Mrs. Griffith (<a href="" title="Lisa Kudrow">Lisa Kudrow</a>), the school counselor, and blames it all on Olive.  Olive agrees to lie to cover up the affair so her favorite teacher, Mr. Griffith&#39;s (<a href="" title="Thomas Haden Church">Thomas Haden Church</a>) marriage would be spared.  Marianne&#39;s religious clique (which Rhiannon also joined) begins harassing Olive in order to get her to leave school.</p>
<p>After an ill-fated date with a boy who wants to pay her to actually sleep with him, not just pretend she did, Olive reconnects with Todd (<a href="" title="Penn Badgley">Penn Badgley</a>), her old crush, who is also the school&#39;s mascot. Todd then tells her that he does not believe the rumors because he remembers when she lied for him when he wasn&#39;t ready for his first kiss years ago. Olive then begins to ask everyone she lied for to help her out by telling the truth, but Brandon and Micah have abruptly left town and everyone else is enjoying their newfound popularity and don&#39;t want the truth to get out. Mrs. Griffith also refuses to tell the truth and when Olive threatens to expose her, Mrs. Griffith rebuffs her, saying no one would believe her. Olive, out of spite, then immediately tells Mr. Griffith, who believes her and separates from Mrs. Griffith.</p>
<p>After a friendly talk with her eccentric, open-minded mother (<a href="" title="Patricia Clarkson">Patricia Clarkson</a>), Olive comes up with a plan to get everything finally out in the open. She then does a song and dance number at a school pep rally to get people&#39;s attention to watch her via web cam, where she confesses what she has done. The various boys whose reputations Olive helped improve are also shown watching. Later, Olive texts Rhiannon apologizing for lying to her. When she is finishing up her web cast, Todd comes by riding a lawnmower and tells her to come outside. She goes outside to meet him and the two are shown riding off on the lawnmower.</p>

<p>Screenwriter <a href="" title="Bert V. Royal">Bert V. Royal</a> claims to have written the entire screenplay, except for the last ten pages, in five days.&#60;ref name=&#34;creativescreenwriting&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Royal&#39;s plan was to adapt three classic works into films and to set them at the same high school, so that some characters would appear in multiple films. Besides <i><a href="" title="The Scarlet Letter">The Scarlet Letter</a></i>, which was the source material for <i>Easy A</i>, Royal wanted to adapt <i><a href="" title="Cyrano de Bergerac (play)">Cyrano de Bergerac</a></i> and <i><a href="" title="The Mystery of Edwin Drood">The Mystery of Edwin Drood</a></i>.&#60;ref name=&#34;creativescreenwriting&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>The song &#34;<a href="" title="Pocketful of Sunshine (song)">Pocketful of Sunshine</a>&#34;, which becomes a running joke in the film, was not in Royal&#39;s original script. He envisioned &#34;Olive&#34;, a track from <a href="" title="Ken Nordine">Ken Nordine</a>&#39;s 1966 album <i>Colors</i>, to play during Olive&#39;s weekend montage (which introduces the song).&#60;ref name=&#34;creativescreenwriting&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>Director Will Gluck wrote the scenes to play &#34;Pocketful of Sunshine&#34; by Natasha Bedingfield because his daughters used to play with a magazine advertisement for Verizon Vcast which featured the song. </p>
<p>Gluck&#39;s favorite film is <i><a href="" title="Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off">Ferris Bueller&#39;s Day Off</a></i> and has multiple homages to it in the film (Olive&#39;s shower mohawk, &#34;never had one lesson&#34;), among many other <a href="" title="John Hughes (filmmaker)">John Hughes</a> references.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Gluck credits Stone with improvising the line about being a &#34;<a href="" title="Gossip Girl (TV series)">Gossip Girl</a> in the <a href="" title="Sweet Valley High">Sweet Valley</a> of <a href="" title="The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants">Traveling Pants</a>&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;moviefone&#34;&#62; 
&#60;/ref&#62;
According to Royal, although the word &#34;<a href="" title="fuck">fuck</a>&#34; appeared 47 times in the original draft and was written as an R-rated comedy, all occurrences were cut from the final film. However, director <a href="" title="Will Gluck">Will Gluck</a> shot two versions of many scenes, both with and without the coarser language.&#60;ref name=&#34;creativescreenwriting&#34; /&#62; Although the film was cut down for a wider audience, the film still obtained a 15 rating in the <a href="" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a>.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>This film was shot on Panavision&#39;s <a href="" title="Genesis (camera)">Genesis</a> and later <a href="" title="filmizing">filmized</a>.</p>
<p>The entire film was shot in <a href="" title="Ojai, California">Ojai, California</a>. Not a single film set was used; even the houses in the film belong to Ojai residents. The school used as &#34;Ojai North High School&#34; in the film is Nordhoff High School, also located in <a href="" title="Ojai, California">Ojai, California</a>.</p>

<p>The film received mainly positive reviews from critics, with many praising Stone&#39;s performance. Review aggregation website <a href="" title="Rotten Tomatoes">Rotten Tomatoes</a> gives the film a &#34;Certified Fresh&#34; rating of 85% based on 175 reviews, with an average score of 7.1/10 and the consensus being, &#34;It owes a huge debt to older (and better) teen comedies, but <i>Easy A</i> proves a smart, witty showcase for its irresistibly charming star, <a href="" title="Emma Stone">Emma Stone</a>.&#34;&#60;ref&#62; 
&#60;/ref&#62;
Another review aggregator, <a href="" title="Metacritic">Metacritic</a>, assigned the film a <a href="" title="Weighted mean">weighted average</a> score of 72% based on 34 reviews from mainstream critics, indicating &#34;generally favorable reviews&#34;.&#60;ref&#62; 
&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In his review, <i><a href="" title="Chicago Sun-Times">Chicago Sun-Times</a></i> film critic <a href="" title="Roger Ebert">Roger Ebert</a> awarded the film three and a half out of four stars, writing, &#34;<i>Easy A</i> offers an intriguing middle ground to the absolute of sexual abstinence: Don&#39;t sleep with anybody, but say you did. It&#39;s a funny, engaging comedy that takes the familiar but underrated Emma Stone and makes her, I believe, a star.&#34;&#60;ref&#62; 
&#60;/ref&#62; <a href="" title="Richard Corliss">Richard Corliss</a> of <i><a href="" title="Time (magazine)">Time Magazine</a></i> named Emma Stone&#39;s performance one of the Top 10 Movie Performances of 2010, saying &#34;Stone lends winning maturity and a gift for making sassy dialogue sound natural. This 22-year-old is an actress-personality — a star — around whom Hollywood could build some pretty good movies&#34;.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>John Griffiths from <i><a href="" title="Us Weekly">Us Weekly</a></i> gave the film two and a half stars out of four; he praised Stone, stating that &#34;With her husky voice and fiery hair, Stone is spectacular, echoing early <a href="" title="Lindsay Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a>&#34;, but also added that &#34;The story is thin, and the laughs meager&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;US Weekly - Issue 829 - Dated January 3, 2011.&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
