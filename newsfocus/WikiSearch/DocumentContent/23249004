<p>I&#39;m possibly being a bit paranoid because it&#39;s on my own talk page, but the sum of the 3 messages left there by <a href="" title="User:Legalfactsupdate">User:Legalfactsupdate</a> lead me to believe that if the user hasn&#39;t technically made a legal threat yet, then one might be on the way.

<dd>Neglecting, for the moment, the distaste I have for Wikipedia even having an article that is 90% about some poor guy allegedly getting caught soliciting a blow job, I have to say that I don&#39;t think that was a legal threat, I think it is quite easy to read that as a good faith request for help, and I think an indef block was too harsh, too quick, and too high handed. And criticizing his grammar looks small and petty.  If you think the &#34;threat&#34; was &#34;crap&#34;, then why was a block even necessary?  Try talking to the guy first. Or, direct him to <a href="" title="WP:OTRS">WP:OTRS</a> and wash your hands.  Or, leave it out of the article while you discuss on <a href="" title="WP:BLPN">WP:BLPN</a>.  Geez, I&#39;m starting to wonder if we should even <b>have</b> BLP&#39;s here at all. Even if all that information is completely sourced, and true, it makes us look unprofessional to have hatchet job articles like that. And it makes us look unprofessional to block people for complaining. And I won&#39;t easily forgive you for making me defend a Republican. --<a href="" title="User:Floquenbeam">Floquenbeam</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Floquenbeam">talk</a>) 20:58, 15 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I see no legal <b>threats</b> being made. Jeremy should reconsider this block immediately. However, this editor&#39;s <i>intent</i> should be taken into account here - obvious <a href="" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> issues are at hand. If he is removing sourced material, then it should be re-added. If these are valid removals (i.e., <a href="" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> concerns), then this editor should be lauded, not blocked. <a href="" title="User:Tanthalas39">&#60;font color=&#34;#CC7722&#34; face=&#34;Papyrus&#34;&#62;<b>Tan</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>  &#38;#124;  <a href="" title="User talk:Tanthalas39">&#60;font color=&#34;#21421E&#34; face=&#34;Papyrus&#34;&#62;39&#60;/font&#62;</a> 22:24, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>No idea if applicable to this case, because I haven&#39;t reviewed it; but being sourced is a necessary but not sufficient reason to write something in an article.  It also needs to be <b>relevent</b> and in <a href="" title="WP:UNDUE">due balance</a>.

<dd>The items being removed are indeed relevant, as they describe a major point in his political career (a conviction for soliciting prostitution), although the article was a bit skewed due to undue weight to the conviction.  However, Legalfactsupdate is removing <b>any</b> mention of it altogether. -&#60;font color=&#34;32CD32&#34;&#62;<i><a href="" title="User:Jéské Couriano">Jeremy</a></i>&#60;/font&#62; &#60;font color=&#34;4682B4&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Jéské Couriano">v^_^v</a> <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Trading card game">Cardmaker</a>)&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62; 23:20, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yes. However, you blocked him for making legal threats of which, again, I see no evidence. Blocking him for such and then arguing that he should remain indefinitely blocked for removing what could plausibly be considered BLP violations is disingenuous. I recommend unblocking with a note discouraging further removal of sourced material and encouraging him to take this up either at the BLP noticeboard or the article talk page, neither of which they previously used. <a href="" title="User:Tanthalas39">&#60;font color=&#34;#CC7722&#34; face=&#34;Papyrus&#34;&#62;<b>Tan</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>  &#38;#124;  <a href="" title="User talk:Tanthalas39">&#60;font color=&#34;#21421E&#34; face=&#34;Papyrus&#34;&#62;39&#60;/font&#62;</a> 00:09, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Hi there. I use the more humorous blocks in two cases: specific (not range) IP blocks and blatant vandals.  I keep all my blocked pages on my watchlist, and I have not seen any uptick in post-ban problems --at least no different than when I used the sterile templates: I receive the same number of personal email insults and talk page vandals (if not a little less). GnarlyLikeWhoa was slightly different, and claimed that I was out of place to note that the IP address of a military base shouldn&#39;t be used to vandalize wikipedia (which is wasting tax payer dollars... gee I wonder how he found out the IP was blocked?), and included a veiled e-thug threat (which I tend to see in web forums, not here). It is not the responsibility of an admin to please everyone they ban --as WP:RBI notes, there are opposing views to Rjanag&#39;s.  As such, there are fans of my templates (Rjanag isn&#39;t one of them, but I respect that).  Honestly, an ANI like <i>this</i> reflects badly on how Wikipedia can be used to punish creativity and put undue pressure where it is not required.  To think, this was all started because I nominated an article for DYK! :-) --<a href="" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Bobak">talk</a>) 00:28, 10 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd><i>aside</i> I didn&#39;t notice this before, but particularly disturbing is <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Matthewkbaldwin&#38;diff=295206965&#38;oldid=294218750" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Matthewkbaldwin&#38;diff=295206965&#38;oldid=294218750">this block</a>, which happened 5 days after the user had last edited and the user had never been warned. Because the user&#39;s offense was spamming, rather than vandalism, it&#39;s also possible that the user just didn&#39;t understand Wikipedia&#39;s spam and EL guidelines, and Bobak&#39;s block message may well have driven away a potentially constructive user. &#60;b class=&#34;Unicode&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Rjanag">r&#60;font color=&#34;#8B0000&#34;&#62;ʨ&#60;/font&#62;anaɢ</a>&#60;/b&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Rjanag">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62;/&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Rjanag">contribs</a>&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 00:03, 10 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Did you look at his contribution history?  The ability to request an unblock is still available.  I haven&#39;t seen an attempt yet. Or perhaps I could&#39;ve used the also-popular method of simply not notifying him of the block or doing massive collateral damage with sloppy IP-range blocks (which I think is are much greater problems).  I make a lot of blocks, so if this one is so terrible, you&#39;re an Admin, go ahead and unblock --I&#39;m not saying I&#39;m the ultimate authority on that.  Will this negatively affect my DYK nomination? :-p --<a href="" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Bobak">talk</a>) 00:28, 10 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dd>Regardless of the user&#39;s contribution history, there&#39;s no reason for blocking him with a message like <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Matthewkbaldwin&#38;diff=295206965&#38;oldid=294218750" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Matthewkbaldwin&#38;diff=295206965&#38;oldid=294218750">this</a>. Yes, he&#39;s a commercial spammer who will probably never make any constructive edits, but the sarcasm is still unnecessary. That goes for your blocking templates, too...I think they&#39;re funny, but I doubt the blocked users do, and blocking and joking don&#39;t mix very well. <a href="" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 00:37, 10 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Neither does lawyering and humor, but god knows we try. I can see how the block on Matthewkbaldwin was perhaps too much, so I&#39;ve lifted it (hurray? Is that a victory?). I got curious so I checked myself: I&#39;ve instituted somewhere in the range of 700+ blocks, and about half were with the funny templates, and half weren&#39;t.  I can say, without hesitation (and a user page history to back it) that I have seen no extra uptick in anything since I started letting vandals know that we have the ability to block now and often.  Honestly, I can respect that some of you, like Rjanag, can find this stuff not to your own particular style, but that doesn&#39;t mean that those of use who are a bit <a href="" title="WP:ROUGE">WP:ROUGE</a> are causing any serious harm to the project --especially without any serious evidence.  As for the blocked users not finding the templates funny... did they before?  Here&#39;s an aside: Rjanag, I noticed you&#39;ve blocked 29 times since you joined the project 9 months ago.  Did you know that if you block 1000 people you get a free toaster? Get cracking. --<a href="" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Bobak">talk</a>) 00:51, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Non-admin view? This is clearly inappropriate. What is the policy basis for a block on the grounds of <b>idiocy</b>? Look, I fight this stuff every day too, and I think a lot of it is pretty funny - but that&#39;s an <i>inside joke</i>, not something a professional organisation presents as its outward face. Laughing at misguided fools should only be done behind the curtain - lord knows we could all make the exact same comments in orange boxes on quite a few admin talk pages...</dd>
<dd>Blocking is <i>srs biznes</i> - please keep it that way and use proper templates. Adminship is not a platform for dispensation of ridicule, it&#39;s a crappy job.

<dd>Yeah, I understand the sentiment here by Bobak, but I would caution against continuing this level of sarcastic commenting at blocks.  Sarcasm is a skill that is hard to pull off well when <i>speaking</i>; it is impossible to do so when <i>typing</i>.  In the course of blocking users, there is no need to be rude and insulting.  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;contribs&#60;/small&#62;</a> 04:10, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Endorse the above comments. Think it if you must - most of us have - but Wikipedia is a highly public site closely watched by the press (amongst others).

<dd>I would have to agree that Bobak&#39;s block messages are highly inappropriate.  To me they don&#39;t come across as sarcastic, but rather as simple childishness.  Wikipedia already has somewhat of a reputation as a place run by kids, and if hundreds of people are being blocked with Bobak&#39;s messages, that bad reputation is just being reinforced.  We need mature admins, not apparently childish ones.  <a href="" title="User:Deli nk">Deli nk</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Deli nk">talk</a>) 10:46, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>One thing should be beyond dispute here, I think, is that these messages should never be used on IP talk pages, where an innocent user may be on the receiving end. Personally I feel that they&#39;re also inappropriate for registered users.  &#60;font color=&#34;006622&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:SheffieldSteel">S&#60;small&#62;HEFFIELD&#60;/small&#62;S&#60;small&#62;TEEL&#60;/small&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;&#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:SheffieldSteel">TALK</a>&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 13:29, 10 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>The community have said plainly more than once that block log entries and user talk notifications of blocks should, except under special circumstances (which don&#39;t seem to apply here), be serious, and especially should not mock affected users.  One may think that injunction to be unnecessarily rigid, but it is plain that it is one for which a consensus exists, and inasmuch as no encyclopedic purpose is served by the jocularity, there is no reason to act in a fashion inconsistent with it.  <a href="" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 17:10, 10 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>Looking at this just a tiny bit further:
<ul>
<li>Bobak is basically accusing GLW of &#34;wasting taxpayer dollars&#34;, implying above that GLW is the vandal associated with usage from a US military IP address. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:139.139.51.70&#38;diff=290596051&#38;oldid=290446651" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:139.139.51.70&#38;diff=290596051&#38;oldid=290446651">I believe this is the reference</a> ABF from an admin, that&#39;s great. I&#39;m unable to find the SPI/CU case establishing the linkage.</li>
<li>You know what? <i>None</i> of my taxpayer dollars were wasted, I live in Canada. Why are administrators of an international project pursuing their own notions of waste using the bully pulpit?</li>
<li>ArbCom has previously considered this notion of &#34;you&#39;re using an American military IP connection, I must expose you!&#34; and arrived at a definition of <a href="#Raising_good-faith_concerns" title="Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Jim62sch">good-faith concerns</a>. I see no such good-faith in the message to the IP talk page linked above. &#34;<b>Stop wasting taxpayer dollars</b>&#34; is not a valid leadin to a block message. Discussion at the time of the cited AC case was relatively clear that US military personnel have wide latitude, despite the written regulations, to use the Internet (note the exception for &#34;when authorised&#34;). I don&#39;t find it acceptable for an administrator of a supposedly international project to bring their own personal view of what constitutes &#34;waste&#34; within their own government onto en:wiki, much less under the official guise of admin status. Besides, use of an IP connection in an idle moment, even if it&#39;s for vandalism, costs far-far-far less than a dollar. Far less, micro-pennies maybe.</li>
<li>And I&#39;ve just removed Bobak&#39;s year-old &#34;VANDAL IDENTIFICATION&#34; message from the IP talk page in question. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A139.139.51.70&#38;diff=295643159&#38;oldid=290596051" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A139.139.51.70&#38;diff=295643159&#38;oldid=290596051"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A139.139.51.70&#38;diff=295643159&#38;oldid=290596051" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A139.139.51.70&#38;diff=295643159&#38;oldid=290596051">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3A139.139.51.70&#38;diff=295643159&#38;oldid=290596051</a></a> If anyone wishes to replace it with a proper template, please do so, but hopefully avoid using the term &#34;vandalicious&#34;.</li></ul></dd>

<dd>This entire thread reflects one of the weaknesses of wikipedia - being polite to belligerent users, and being belligerent to those who try to defend wikipedia against vandals.

<dd>&#34;...I think they&#39;re funny, but I doubt the blocked users do...&#34; News flash: <i>Who cares what the blocked users think?</i> They are blocked because they damaged wikipedia in some way. Whether they get a cute comment or the standard, sternly-worded blocking box, either way they&#39;re typically not happy about it. Many times they will blank the page to get rid of those standard messages, and fill the page with rants. So a lot of good it does to &#34;play it straight&#34;. Maybe the right thing to do, if you&#39;re wanting to take the &#34;coddling&#34; approach, is to re-word those sternly-worded standard messages to express deep regret that we have to do this: &#34;This hurts us more than it does you&#34;, or some such. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs">carrots</a> 13:31, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Blocked users still go around and talk to their friends. They might grow up and, a few months after their block, realize that yeah, they had it coming. Or they might go tell their friends that Wikipedia is just a bunch of dicks who don&#39;t let you have any fun and are rude to you. I wonder which they&#39;ll be doing more often after getting one of Bobak&#39;s messages/</dd>
<dd>Consensus is clear that he needs to stop using them. The only question now is, as Deli nk asked, whether the templates should be replaced. Personally, I don&#39;t think that is workable, since they are not transcluded templates&#38;mdash;it looks like Bobak copied and pasted the code of the regular block messages, because I don&#39;t see any user subpages that he could have been subst&#39;ing. I think it should be sufficient just for him to stop using them in the future. &#60;b class=&#34;Unicode&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Rjanag">r&#60;font color=&#34;#8B0000&#34;&#62;ʨ&#60;/font&#62;anaɢ</a>&#60;/b&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Rjanag">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62;/&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Rjanag">contribs</a>&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 13:49, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>That&#39;s a bogus argument. The belligerent users out there who go running to wikipedia review and the like, have nearly all been recipients of the standard, sternly-worded message.

<p>&#60;big&#62;Hey everyone!&#60;/big&#62; This crap has been going on for <i>ages</i> and you only notice it now!  Here&#39;s a message for you, courtesy of a long-time admin:
 
He <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/User:Ryan_Postlethwaite/blocked" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:WhatLinksHere/User:Ryan_Postlethwaite/blocked">delivered this message</a> to four IP users in 2007.

<dd>I would think a lighthearted message like that would be much more likely to be received positively than the &#34;Bang! You&#39;re dead!&#34; standard notices. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs">carrots</a> 18:15, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Bugs, I seem to recall having briefly tangled with you before in this venue over your penchant for poking fun at those brought to administrator attention. Whether the end result is better or not, and your own opinions on what is lighthearted fun that most people will receive more positively is irrelevant. The point is that we need to deliver a professional message. When an admin makes a block, they&#39;re not entitled to deliver their opinion on the supposed <b>idiocy</b> of the user in question. They&#39;re &#34;an errand boy, sent by clerks&#34; (or whatever the fat guy said), they&#39;re not there to opine on intelligence or fitness for life in general, they are <i>protecting the encyclopedia from damage</i>. That&#39;s all, there&#39;s no entertainment value included, or perhaps they shouldn&#39;t be admins after all.</dd>
<dd>As far as Ryan P&#39;s block notices, they were long in the past, but you know what? How &#39;bout I trot on over and ask for a comment? <a href="" title="User:Franamax">Franamax</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Franamax">talk</a>) 02:41, 12 June 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The argument made was that sarcastic messages will cause blocked users to go tell their friends how lousy wikipedia is. And I say that&#39;s a bogus argument. Nearly every indef&#39;d vandal has gotten the standard &#34;Bang! You&#39;re dead&#34; message, and all indications are that they go tell their friends how lousy wikipedia is. So instead of only picking on that handful of block messages, you need to also focus on the flaws in the standard message. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs">carrots</a> 02:48, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yeah, you may well have a point there, but this is not really the place to raise systemic issues. I appreciate your message but in reality I think you&#39;re just confusing up a behavioural issue by bringing up a longer-term problem. I personally don&#39;t use many of those boilerplate templates, since I have to actually hold down one key whilst typing another, twice, then figure it all out again at the end but the squiggly has to frown at the first one. It&#39;s like, totally confusing. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever dropped an actual   or   or whatever the vandalism template thingy is. I prefer a quiet (and non-humour/sarcasm/acerbic) personal message to vandals, it works 99.5%. But that&#39;s a whole different issue - we&#39;re talking here about an admin  choosing to use their granted powers to make personal commentary about other editors, in the ultimate power situation, the one where they revoke the other editor&#39;s privileges. That&#39;s just not on. There&#39;s a whole IRC channel for admins to let off steam, no need for it to happen on editor talk pages. <a href="" title="User:Franamax">Franamax</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Franamax">talk</a>) 03:10, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;ll admit that some of them are a tad bit over the line. One that I would be tempted to use when indefing would be something like &#34;you&#39;ve made some good edits at times, so I&#39;m subtracting a day from your indefinite block&#34;. It&#39;s a good fantasy, anyway. Maybe a good start would be some better illustrations. I like the one with the illustration of a block. That&#39;s better than the scary big red X. Maybe for spamming, an actual spam can would be the ticket. It&#39;s also important for the block notice to emphasize that they can appeal the block. It already says that, obviously, but maybe that could be illustrated too, with an open cell door or something. (Ain&#39;t I creative? A right brain is a terrible thing to waste, you know.) <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs">carrots</a> 03:22, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Like Franamax and others have said, regardless of what its effect on vandals themselves is, it&#39;s childish to use your admin position of power to rub everything you can in people&#39;s faces. We&#39;re supposed to be acting like adults here. I certainly don&#39;t want people I know to come in and get the impression that this site their friend/brother/son spends so much time on is run by a bunch of children.</dd>
<dd>As for being creative with block messages...yes, Bobak made the same argument up above.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Replace_them.3F">Replace them?</span></h3>
<p>There seems to be a clear consensus that these block messages are completely inappropriate. According to statements above, they have been used on hundreds of pages.  Since these messages may be doing harm to the project, should they be removed or replaced with a more appropriate standard block template?  Can a bot do this, perhaps (if necessary)?  <a href="" title="User:Deli nk">Deli nk</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Deli nk">talk</a>) 12:57, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I said above that I imagined cleaning them up would not be workable (since they&#39;re all copy-paste versions of regular block templates, modified by hand; there&#39;s not transcluded, subst&#39;ed, or in any way identifiable to a bot...although I suppose a bot might be able to comb through all of Bobak&#39;s user talk contribs) and that I figured it would be enough if Bobak just agrees to stop using them.

<dd>  I find the use of sarcasm in these templates disgraceful, antagonistic, and an embarrassment to the project.

<dd>You are probably right about that. However, my experience has shown that spending too much time on WP:AN &#38; WP:AN/I warps one&#39;s sense of what Wikipedia is about, as well as proving to be, in the long run, not all that productive. Take a break from here, Bugs, &#38; find another part of Wikipedia to contribute to. WP:AN/I will still be here when you come back, with the same troublemakers &#38; jerk Admins; they&#39;ll just have different user names. -- <a href="" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Llywrch">talk</a>) 20:11, 12 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Let me be clear that I&#39;m not going to fight any of this (&#34;consensus&#34; of a half-dozen editors reigns supreme), but this ANI is obviously a group of editors with the same opinions, and I do point out that there are a lot of people who feel the way I do: that so-called &#34;fixes&#34; like this are ultimately pointless (storms in a teacup) that do more to harm to productive (non-bureaucratic) editors than any alleged &#34;embarrassment&#34; they save for those unable to have a sense of humor.  But carry on... just don&#39;t forget that this is a project about compiling information, not silly little crusades.  I am not going to take the time to look up the various contribution histories in this discussion, but I hope some of you have done remotely the same amount of work people like Baseball Bugs and I have done --otherwise why participate? --<a href="" title="User:Bobak">Bobak</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Bobak">talk</a>) 19:26, 12 June 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>I can&#39;t comment on appropriateness of the blocks as I&#39;m unfamiliar with the cases, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s appropriate to condemn the funny messages.  I don&#39;t know for sure if they&#39;re up to par for a Good Humour Barnstar, but they&#39;re certainly useful in countertroll situations.

<p>The use of sarcasm is <i>absolutely and completely inappropriate</i> in a block message.

<dd>Paul: Blanket bans on humorous or sarcastic (&#34;playful&#34;) edit and log summaries really isn&#39;t effective or productive. Should administrators be professional? Yes. However, they are also allowed some degree of latitude when dealing with monotonous administrative affairs, esp. as some of these users do dozens or hundreds of actions per month. Like nearly all things, moderation is key. Bobak seems to be too far to one side, but you seem to be too far to the other. There&#39;s a healthy balance in between&#38;mdash;with or without italics, adverbs, and threats to remove rights. ;-)  --<a href="" title="User:MZMcBride">MZMcBride</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:MZMcBride">talk</a>) 19:38, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<li>I really think I need to leave ANI for awhile. This nonsense that treating vandals with some kind of faux politesse will help them see the light and become valued contributors seems silly to me. If anything, a spot of humor might do the trick better than some form letter-style block template. Bobak is blocking vandals, so Paul August feels the need to issue a veiled threat of removal of administrator status?

<dd>We hold as an ideal that <i>Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit</i>. It is one of our most noble ideals. It is why many of us are here, and why we have been so successful. But unfortunately it is <i>only</i> an ideal &#38;mdash; not a reality. The fact of the matter is, we sometimes find it necessary to block some from editing. But blocking is an admission of failure &#38;mdash; our failure in being able to fully realize one of our most cherished goals. Hence blocking is a sad thing, it is a serious thing, and it should not be done lightly. Humor has its place (a sock puppet, a meat puppet and Jimbo walk into a bar ...&#60;ref&#62;Prize for best completion. First entry <a href="#Pretty_lame.2C_but_I.27ll_give_it_a_shot..." title="User_talk:Paul_August">here</a>.&#60;/ref&#62;) but not when it comes to blocking. And I find little humor in: &#34;Congratulations! You have been blocked&#34;, &#34;Lucky for you I give out blocks like they&#39;re going out of style&#34;, &#34;You&#39;ve been put out of your spamming misery&#34; and &#34;You have been blocked indefinitely ... for idiocy.&#34; What I <i>do</i> find is sarcasm, insults and ridicule &#38;mdash; these things have no place at all, especially not from administrators.</dd></dl>

<dd>As for my remarks being a &#34;veiled threat&#34;, there is nothing veiled about them, and I&#39;m not threatening anything or anyone. What I <i>am</i> trying to do is  raise the level of administrative conduct. To remind us all that when we take administrative action we are representing the encyclopedia and this project. That we should all act professionally and with maturity. And to remind us all that everything we do, we do <i>in public</i>, anyone anywhere, now and in the future can view what we are doing. Please try to imagine how this might look say in a New York Times article about Wikipedia: <i>Wikipedia&#39;s administrators routinely block people from editing for reasons like &#34;idiocy&#34; and with messages like &#34;Congratulations!

<dd>I don&#39;t particularly like any of the custom block templates (&#34;congratulations, you&#39;ve been blocked,&#34; etc.). The standard ones exist for a reason and should be used primarily unless there&#39;s a specific reason not to. (You shouldn&#39;t template longtime users, for example.) My comments above mainly concern block reasons left in the logs. Personally, I usually use the tactic of making the log summaries exceptionally vague (&#34;inappropriate behavior,&#34; etc.), however I don&#39;t have a particular problem with, for example, blocking a &#34;poop&#34; vandal with the reason &#34;THE PLUMBER HAS ARRIVED!&#34; Obviously we shouldn&#39;t feed the trolls, but a spot of humor occasionally isn&#39;t inappropriate. --<a href="" title="User:MZMcBride">MZMcBride</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:MZMcBride">talk</a>) 20:05, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<li>To be clear, I did not find the custom block templates in question wildly hilarious or anything like that.

<p>I have been forwarded to this page via Wiki user <a href="" title="User:Cirt">User:Cirt</a> who has kindly been helping me with an ongoing situation, in which an IP user has been posting liable attacks via talk pages, and also has obtained my email address and posting the same context in emails.</p>
<p>The IP user in question has so far used 2 different IP addresses; they are... <a href="" title="User:85.50.127.181">IP:85.50.127.181</a> and <a href="" title="User:90.163.33.152">IP:90.163.33.152</a>.  The first incident happened on the main <a href="" title="Eurovision Song Contest">Eurovision Song Contest</a> page.  I made reasonable changes to the article; as I had found reliable sources to back up an edit in the article.  Within hours of me making this edit; I received a vicious email from a <b>HOTMAIL</b> account.  In the email I was subdued to abusive language.  I replied to the email sender telling them that if they were to do such an act again, that I would have no other alternative but to report them to the relevant authorities.  Everything was quiet until last week, when I made another edit, only this time to the <a href="" title="Eurovision Song Contest 2010">Eurovision Song Contest 2010</a> article, in which again I had found reliable sourcing to allow me to include the country of Estonia into the confirmed participation list.  What happened following this utterly disturbed me.  One user, who obviously is the same person, left 2 messages in the <a href="" title="Talk:Eurovision Song Contest 2010">Talk:Eurovision Song Contest 2010</a>.  The reason I know they are the same person, as they signed their comments using the same tag-line, but with a different IP address included in the tag.  The IPs are those as shown above (<a href="" title="User:85.50.127.181">IP:85.50.127.181</a> and <a href="" title="User:90.163.33.152">IP:90.163.33.152</a>).  That same user also sent the exact same comments to me via email; again the email address was the same HOTMAIL address as that sent weeks earlier following the main incident as mentioned above.</p>
<p>I would sincerely appreciate it, if you could kindly investigate this situation, and keep me informed as to what action has been taken.  I will fully co-operate with this investigation, if you so require me to do so.</p>

<li>The difficulty is that Allstarecho&#39;s comments after he was blocked have tended to suggest that he does not recognize that his copyright violations are wrong; for this reason, his protestations that he will not continue to disregard copyright have not been wholly credible. He could begin to restore this credibility by starting to go through his past contributions and identifying all edits which used stolen text; this, at a bare minimum, would be an essential component of any path to eventual unblocking. <a href="" title="User:CIreland">CIreland</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:CIreland">talk</a>) 03:16, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Is everyone stuck on retirement?  ASE has stated before and I have above that retirement is a &#34;moot point&#34;.  He wishes to come back, which would mean he isn&#39;t retired.

<li><b>support unblock</b> At this point, I don&#39;t think it is imperative that he is kept blocked, given that he has expressed clearly that he understands why he was blocked, and has promised to change his behavior. Blocking him again would be trivial at this point, and he should know he is being closely watched. Making him jump through some arbitrary hoops to get the unblock seems pointless given the ease with which any admin could block him again if he screws up the copyright thing any further. --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;contribs&#60;/small&#62;</a> 03:30, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<p>(edit conflict x2) I&#39;ve unblocked him. The declines seemed excessively wiki-lawyerish to me; Allstarecho wants to edit and promised not to violate copyright anymore.

<dd>Hmmm. I still think he has an ethical obligation to assist in cleaning up the mess, simply because it&#39;s far easier for him than anyone else to identify which edits amongst his very many otherwise excellent contributions were theft.

<dd>I agree that he has an ethical obligation to assist in cleaning up the mess. I also note that ethical obligations are often unmet on Wikipedia. Since I unblocked him, I&#39;ll ask him on his talkpage to help us clean up the copyvios. Since I unblocked him, it&#39;s only fair that I help in doing so also.

<p>Based upon the massive disruption he made to Wikipedia (knowingly adding copyright violations for years because he disagrees with copyright laws), and especially with his completely unapologetic tone after his block, he needs to stay blocked for a good long while to realize that this kind of behavior is unacceptable. A couple of months minimum is reasonable, or at the very least until all the damage he caused is undone. Akhiklleus should have waited for more input before unblocking, because jumping ahead to do it before there was real discussion or any way to gauge consensus just puts everyone in a bad spot. People have been permanently banned for less than what ASE did. <a href="" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DreamGuy">talk</a>) 03:41, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>DreamGuy: maybe you&#39;re right. If so, discussion here should establish a consensus against my unblock, and I won&#39;t stand in its way. Until then, I hope that community scrutiny will stop further copyvios by Allstarecho, or lead to his block. I don&#39;t really care if he apologizes, expresses remorse, or so forth--forced apologies don&#39;t strike me as useful. The important thing is that he stops the objectionable behavior. If he doesn&#39;t, then he gets blocked again. <a href="" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 03:52, 13 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<ul>
<li>This unblock was a bad call - there was no need to rush and I&#39;m not certain Akhilleus is actually familiar with the situation and how these matters are typically handled. I think that Allstarecho has been the one splitting hairs and wikilawyering since this problem was noticed - quite a few editors have tried to get a straight answer and his responses have been petulant and unhelpful. This issue was so widespread that it required not the usual one, but <a href="" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject_Copyright_Cleanup/Contributor_surveys"><i>three</i> pages</a> at the copyvio project for tracking. While I agree that forced apologies are useless, if a contributor shows no remorse and has to be forced to admit they were wrong, isn&#39;t that just a useless? I have zero confidence in this unblock and I resent the fact that the unblocking admin&#39;s solution is that someone (other than themselves of course) should closely babysit Allstarecho. <a href="" title="User:Shell_Kinney">Shell</a>   &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Shell_Kinney">babelfish</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 05:42, 13 June 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have already said, I will be happy (even as a non-admin) to mentor ASE as necessary and to make sure that his edits are within the letter of the rule and that no copyvio edits are brought in, but I think we need to give ASE a chance to edit first.  It is 3:29AM EST, so he isn&#39;t online, probably asleep.  Let&#39;s let him edit first before going all &#34;bad block&#34; &#34;let&#39;s reblock him&#34; on the whole thing.

<li>I&#39;m going to guess you&#39;re not aware that I assume good faith, usually till my eyes bleed :)  Even so, there&#39;s a point where it stops being an assumption of good faith and instead becomes turning a blind eye to a problem; that&#39;s where I have to get off the bus.  If you&#39;re aware of this case, surely you&#39;re aware that this wasn&#39;t just limited to article space, included difficult to detect copying of just sentences or phrases and that the only response has been &#34;yeah, so what?&#34; until an indef block was in place?  I don&#39;t see anything in ASE&#39;s response that would make me comfortable that he won&#39;t continue the same behavior, maybe not at first, maybe not while he&#39;s being watched but I&#39;m confident he would have no qualms repeating the behavior if he thought he could get away with it.  I don&#39;t even see anything about him being interested in contributing further, only that he&#39;d rather not be blocked.  I would consider this an excellent example of a block intended to prevent further damage and disruption to the project and the unblock before allowing some semblance of discussion here was unwise. <a href="" title="User:Shell_Kinney">Shell</a>   &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Shell_Kinney">babelfish</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 08:33, 13 June 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><a href="" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> says, &#34;Unless there is strong evidence to the contrary, assume that people who work on the project are trying to help it, not hurt it.&#34; The cleanup of this offers plenty of evidence to the contrary.

There can be no question that much of the language was the same; origin seems clear. Keep in mind that Allstarecho was notified of copyright policy several years ago and one of his responses on noting these concerns was to indicate that &#34;Most of these g&#39;damn articles were done in my wiki-infancy. Any newer ones which may be in question, I don&#39;t agree that statistical facts (dates, percentages, times and related words to explain such facts) is copyrightable&#34;<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive544#Copyright_input_request" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive544#Copyright_input_request"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive544#Copyright_input_request" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive544#Copyright_input_request">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive544#Copyright_input_request</a></a>. His primary interest during the whole of this clean-up is arguing about whether the copyright infringements removed from articles were actually placed by him. While he&#39;s very vocal when he thinks somebody has removed something in error, I&#39;ve yet to see him say, &#34;Oh, yes, that one was mine. My bad.&#34; Does he still believe that material like <a class="externallink" href="http://users.panola.com/AAghS/ARTICLES/FAULKNER.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://users.panola.com/AAghS/ARTICLES/FAULKNER.html">this</a> and <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=285367195&#38;oldid=285366236" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?diff=285367195&#38;oldid=285366236">this</a>, also from April of this year, are not copyrightable?

<li>Oppose unblock, bad call, particularly without bringing the initial blocking admin into it. I support a reblock - he&#39;s never made any statement to indicate what he did was wrong, and has been particularly offensive to those users like Moonriddengirl who take the time and effort to chase people like him. An offensive, disruptive serial copyright violator who now expects us to trust him? By this point good faith has been thrown out the window, and I see no reason to believe he&#39;s truly changed - rather I see his apology as not &#34;sorry I violated copyright&#34; but more &#34;sorry I was blocked for violating copyright&#34;. <a href="" title="User:Ironholds">Ironholds</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ironholds">talk</a>) 11:14, 13 June 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>Glow in the dark bad unblock. This user causes major harm to the project. He doesn&#39;t grasp the concept of Intellectual property, nor Copyright, thus demonstrating no respect for authors nor the law. What makes anyone think he gives a damn about this project? He wants back in for his own addictive needs, and for the ego buff he gets from publishing stuff. Unless and until such time as he provides fro us a clear, lengthy essay about his &#39;awakening&#39; to the rights of authors to have their works protected, and the value of copyright laws in protecting the creative impulse for the larger betterment of society, I see no value in AGF&#39;ing. He&#39;s made clear his commitment to actively refuting and ignoring Copyright laws and Wikipedia&#39;s policies on the same, and his desperate &#39;i won&#39;t do it again, I swear&#39; is simply insufficient. <a href="" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ThuranX">talk</a>) 12:10, 13 June 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>While the unblock may or may not have been ill-judged, it has been done. The result is that Allstarecho is under severe scrutiny for copyright (and likely any other) violations in his editing - his last chance has been and gone, and the next time he puts principle in these matters before WP policy he is gone permanently. I doubt that Allstarecho would have been allowed to return to editing under any more stringent conditions so, despite it being perhaps a little premature, I think we can close this matter as resolved. <a href="" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:LessHeard vanU">talk</a>) 12:57, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<li>I disagree with this assessment. It&#39;s his duty to clean up the mess he created and it&#39;s not formally part of his conditions that he does so.

<li><b>Comment</b> - I&#39;ve <a href="" title="WP:AGF">AGFed</a> until my eyes not only bled but fell out of my head, and I have to agree that this isn&#39;t a good idea at this time. As a very involved admin, I either am biased or <i>appear biased</i>, so I won&#39;t argue the point strongly. Since I know where many of the proverbial bodies are buried, I will make a few points that should be considered (and I wish had been considered before an unblock):</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Let&#39;s keep in mind that at least two <i>blatant</i> copyvios remain: <a href="" title="Old Mississippi State Capitol">Old Mississippi State Capitol</a> and <a href="" title="Ole Miss Rebels football">Ole Miss Rebels football</a>. There may be more. &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;padding:2px;border:1px solid #000000&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Frank">&#60;span style=&#34;color:cyan;background:blue&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;Frank&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="user_talk:Frank">&#60;span style=&#34;color:blue;background:cyan&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;talk&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 13:11, 13 June 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Further, keep in mind that many more copyvios were found and removed during the course of this investigation, including, for example, <a href="" title="Frank Frost">Frank Frost</a> and <a href="" title="Pearl, Mississippi">Pearl, Mississippi</a>, and some were even deleted, such as <a href="" title="Alamo Theater (Mississippi)">Alamo Theater (Mississippi)</a> and the article that put us on this path when I found it at <a href="" title="Template talk:DYK">Template talk:DYK</a>, <a href="" title="Lazy Magnolia Brewing Company">Lazy Magnolia Brewing Company</a>.</li>
<li>It should be noted that <a href="" title="User:Neutralhomer">User:Neutralhomer</a> is an unapologetic cheerleader for ASE, given <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294528346" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294528346">this sarcastic comment</a> shortly after the initial block. I have no problem with liking and supporting a contributor; what I disapproved of in that comment was that either there was no attempt to look at the facts of the matter, or the facts were ignored. To his credit, NH did actually look a bit later and allowed as how he <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294872851" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Incidents&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294872851">must agree with the community on this one</a>. Now he&#39;s back on the other side of the fence. (Sorry if this seems like I&#39;m commenting on the contributor rather than the content; I&#39;m merely pointing out that this is a highly-involved user and providing some context.) Also, it should be revealed that we subsequently discovered a content disagreement we have, but again - I&#39;m confining this to ASE, nothing more. I just think that if it is agreed that mentoring is the right way to go, perhaps a better choice would be someone other than a cheerleader.</li>
<li>I think it would be wise to consider the length and severity of these violations, which would require an RfC to fully document, but a short summary can be found in <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moonriddengirl&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=295406131" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moonriddengirl&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=295406131">this comment</a> I made at <a href="" title="User talk:Moonriddengirl">User talk:Moonriddengirl</a>.</li>
<li>It&#39;s been pointed out that ASE doesn&#39;t display what most of us would call a solid understanding of copyright, or what we&#39;d call a desire to comply with policy. Here are just a few diffs in support of that: <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Go,_Mississippi&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294507953" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Go,_Mississippi&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294507953">You can&#39;t copyright facts</a>, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lanier_High_School_(Jackson,_Mississippi)&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294453090" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lanier_High_School_(Jackson,_Mississippi)&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294453090">as usual, facts can&#39;t be copyrighted but whatever</a>, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tyrone_Nix&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=293393018" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tyrone_Nix&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=293393018">you can&#39;t copyright fact...</a>, and this one from 2007: <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=160387371" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=160387371">While I don&#39;t feel text about a public educational institution, especially one my tax dollars help pay for, is copyrighted, I made changes.</a>.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>So, having said all that, if we are allowing the unblock to stand, a whole bunch of editors need to keep careful watch. ASE has repeatedly and forcefully resisted comments that characterize his edits as copyvios, instead choosing to point out that the text is elsewhere also, that someone else put it there, or that it isn&#39;t copyrightable. He has not participated even one edit&#39;s worth in cleaning up copyright violations since he was blocked, despite requests to do so, and has hampered others&#39; efforts to do so because some of us have been willing to AGF and pay attention. &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;padding:2px;border:1px solid #000000&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Frank">&#60;span style=&#34;color:cyan;background:blue&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;Frank&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; &#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="user_talk:Frank">&#60;span style=&#34;color:blue;background:cyan&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;talk&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 13:11, 13 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Hmph. Well, as I said, it&#39;s entirely possible I made a mistake, and if there is consensus to reverse my unblock (as it appears there might be), I won&#39;t stand in its way. 
I&#39;d just like to note, though, that the discussion on Allstarecho&#39;s talk page involved apparent technicalities such as whether he was retired or not, and also whether he was adopting the proper abject attitute of contrition. If the discussion had clearly communicated &#34;your copyvios are so bad there&#39;s no way I&#39;ll unblock you&#34; then of course I wouldn&#39;t have unblocked. I&#39;m glad to see that people are taking copyvios seriously, though--when I&#39;ve reported blatant plagiarism from copyrighted sources before, I&#39;ve gotten no response or a shrug. <a href="" title="User:Akhilleus">--Akhilleus</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Akhilleus">talk</a>) 13:16, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<li>It might have been appropriate, as a condition of unblocking, and in light of his promise not to violate copyright again, to explain whether he still agrees with these sentiments that he had posted on his talk page shortly after being blocked: <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294640279" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294640279"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294640279" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294640279">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294640279</a></a><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294646644" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294646644"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294646644" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294646644">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Allstarecho&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=294646644</a></a> <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs">carrots</a> 13:28, 13 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>First, I&#39;ll say it&#39;s never been said by me that copyvios were perfectly ok. What I have said is that apparently statistical facts, close paraphrasing and quoting is considered as copyvios, unbeknownst to me. I guess that is my fault for not finding out. However, I have seen many a &#34;copyvio&#34; removed from articles that have been attributed to me when in fact they weren&#39;t. Numerous copyvios that have been attributed to me, were nothing more than copyvio content that was already present in an article or in an article that I split to another (see <a href="" title="Ole Miss Rebels">Ole Miss Rebels</a> and <a href="" title="Ole Miss Rebels football">Ole Miss Rebels football</a> as an excellent example). I had no idea that I had to go through each and every article I ever came across to make sure it didn&#39;t contain copyvio content. Do you do that on every article you&#39;ve ever come across? I&#39;m sure one or 2 of you do but I&#39;d bet my house that most of you do not. Additionally, during vandalism patrol, yes, I may have reverted vandalism that also included reverting an article back to a &#34;copyvio included&#34; state, but how am I to know that? Seriously? Regardless, any continued block is nothing but punishment, which is whole-heartedly not in line with <a href="" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a>. As I have promised not to add copyvio content anymore, and as I know many an eye is on my edits, continued blocking can be viewed as nothing but punishment from this point. I&#39;m not asking for your respect or your approval of me as a person as that really means nothing to me. I&#39;m just asking that people be fair here.

<p>When someone uploads a large number of photos and many of them are found to be copyvios, then of course the rest needs to be deleted as well unless there is strong evidence that they are not copyvios. When someone is caught adding large amounts of copyrighted text to Wikipedia, then of course every substantial addition of text by that editor needs to be deleted unless there is strong evidence it&#39;s not a copyvio. After all, there are still books and magazines that are not available online.</p>
<p>What I have not seen, and what is absolutely necessary for this unblock to be at all reasonable is:
</p>
<ul>
<li>An unequivocal <i>demonstration</i> (as opposed to a mere affirmation) by ASE that he now understands how copyright works.</li>
<li>A binding commitment to help clean up his copyvios.</li>
<li>A prohibition of any substantial article space edits other than his clean-up work for the time being.</li></ul>

<p>Before he can be allowed to add more than, say, half a sentence per month to any article:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The clean-up work must have been finished.</li>
<li>He must <i>demonstrate</i> (rather than just assert) that he can add text to articles through methods other than plagiarism. One way to demonstrate this would be a series of assignments in which he has to develop an article on a prescribed obscure topic using a prescribed set of sources, in a short amount of time.</li></ul>

<p>Anything less would be in contradiction to the core principle that Wikipedia is first and foremost an encyclopedia. Seeing that it can take several <a href="" title="man-hours">man-hours</a> to properly identify and clean up the damage done in ten minutes by some quick copy-paste operation, and that this thankless work must be done by qualified volunteers – many of whom would prefer to write content for articles of their own choosing – this kind of generous unblock on the whim of an administrator is simply not acceptable. --<a href="" title="User:Hans Adler">Hans Adler</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hans Adler">talk</a>) 16:55, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>A prohibition from article space edits is unacceptable. What&#39;s the point of being on Wikipedia if you can&#39;t edit articles. I&#39;m not to be treated like some toddler confined to his playpen.</dd>

<dd>AllStar, you have earned the perspective that you are a toddler to be supervised everywhere. You got caught breaking a major, bedrock policy built to match the laws of most nations on the planet. Instead of immediately apologizing, you continued for over a year doing it. When you were finally caught again and blocked, you threw a tanrum, took your ball and left. Then you came back, &#39;unretiring&#39; after the heat was off, a tactic you knew would reduce the actions against you, and then, when confronted, you&#39;ve done nothing but make empty promises and blame others.</dd>
<dd>You have yet to explain, in your own words, what you did wrong, why it was wrong, why you won&#39;t do it again. An Open apology letter to the community would go a long way; taking responsibility for reversing every single copyvio addition you ever made would help too. However, all we get are condescending dismissals of our concerns &#39;I already SAID i wouldn&#39;t do it anymore&#39; is meaningless. It&#39;s meaningless because you&#39;ve made clear that you do not accept the <b>idea</b> of copyright - that the very principles of it aren&#39;t valid, they don&#39;t apply to you. This can easily be seen in your attitude that &#39;facts cannot have copyright&#39;. However, they can and do. It&#39;s up to you to explain to us why, as part of that open apology.</dd>

<dd>My point was that you made a slight rephrasing, someone else made a further slight rephrasing, and it&#39;s still blatant plagiarism. My understanding of US copyright law is that this kind of rephrasing is not enough, and basically these are merely typical steps to cover up a copyvio. The only thing I am not sure about is whether lifting two sentences literally is OK. It might be below some threshold. As to your post on Frank&#39;s talk page – that one puzzled me, and I am still puzzled that it came before your rephrasing. --<a href="" title="User:Hans Adler">Hans Adler</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hans Adler">talk</a>) 21:13, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>It came before my rephrasing because I wanted him to look at it before my rephrasing. Then after asking him about it, I realized even in the state it was in it could be considered as close paraphrasing so I went on and made changes to it. He apparently looked at it after my change or the 2 changes and feels its acceptable via his reply to me. <b>-</b> <a href="" title="User:Allstarecho"><b>A</b>LLST<b>✰</b>R</a>&#60;span class=&#34;Unicode&#34; style=&#34;color:#FF72E3;&#34;&#62;▼&#60;/span&#62;<b>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Allstarecho">echo</a>&#60;/sup&#62;</b> &#60;sub&#62;<b><a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Allstarecho">wuz here</a> @</b>&#60;/sub&#62; 21:41, 13 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Admittedly I&#39;m coming to this conversation later, but in fairness to ASE I&#39;d like to point out one thing: similarities like the ones Hans Adler has found is considered plagiarism <i>only if</i> there is reasonable leeway to rephrase the original language. Just how many different ways can one say, &#34;According to an FBI report released in June 2009 for the 2008 year, Jackson&#39;s murder rate ranks 4th in the nation&#34;? Maybe he should have tried harder to put this in different words, but the source for the statement in Wikipedia expresses the information concisely &#38; clearly; apparently without knowledge of the wording of the source, Gavia immer made several edits which made ASE&#39;s paraphrase more closely resemble the source.

<p>I&#39;m the admin who originally blocked Allstarecho for copyright problems. I didn&#39;t know about this thread until just now. I approve of the unblock. </p>
<p>On the one hand, ASE has handled this whole situation quite badly, being defensive and sarcastic and unacceptably rude in at least one case. He hasn&#39;t said anything like &#34;I know this was wrong, and I&#39;m sorry.&#34; But he has clearly and repeatedly said that he won&#39;t do anything else that might violate copyright, and I believe him. (And if I&#39;m wrong, it&#39;s not hard to reblock.) Should he own up and apologize? Yeah, I think so, but it&#39;s really none of my business. Would it have been easier on everyone if he had? Absolutely. Would I get some satisfaction on seeing him forced to apologize? Perhaps, I mean I&#39;m only human, but that&#39;s not a valid use of a block. The preventative block is no longer needed; So long as he isn&#39;t copying and pasting questionable content -- and he&#39;s not -- he&#39;s welcome to contribute constructively. &#38;ndash; <a href="" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User_talk:Quadell">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 04:31, 14 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>We now have a much more clear statement from Allstarecho that he will not repeat the problem and even that he will assist in any cleanup.  While I still think some level of supervision is appropriate, that clears up my concerns about leaving the block in place. <a href="" title="User:Shell_Kinney">Shell</a>   &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Shell_Kinney">babelfish</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 09:34, 14 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>I do not believe him. We do not have a case here of ignorance, but of outright refusal. He&#39;s made it his position on copyright clear; it&#39;s a matter of principle to him that copyright should not exist or be respected, therefore, I find it hard to believe that he&#39;s suddenly converted to a great understanding of the value of protecting the works done by others. I think that what we&#39;re going to see, six months to a year out, is an editor who persists in copyright violations via plagiarism, but now does it more subtly, rephrasing half a sentence into the article in one edit, then the other half, then linking them up. He will become a better, more subtle thief of others efforts, not someone truly able to write independently. <a href="" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ThuranX">talk</a>) 14:40, 14 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I believe &#34;documentation&#34; refers to the sourcing given when you upload the images as to who made them, where they came from, so on.

<dd>Thanks for displaying the sort of attitude we like on Wikipedia - that&#39;s <i>really</i> going to swing community consensus in your direction. AGF does not apply in this situation, you&#39;ve provided no evidence that you&#39;ve changed and no evidence that you understand why what do you did was wrong - indeed, every statement by you I&#39;ve seen seems to be designed to avoid saying that violating copyright is actually wrong, instead simply saying that we have a problem with it. If you want us to assume good faith in this situation you have to give something to show you&#39;ve changed and this is a novel situation, rather than (as Thuran put it) another attempt to claw back a fix. <a href="" title="User:Ironholds">Ironholds</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ironholds">talk</a>) 06:12, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Your promise only acknowledges one problem - that you got in trouble. You have yet to acknowledge the importance of copyright in the world, or any understanding of why it needs to be respected. All you promises show is that you know you got in trouble for getting caught. Do you understand there&#39;s a difference between trying to get out of trouble, and trying to change an offending behavior? What Ironholds and I both want is for you to make a public statement explaining the value of copyright. Demonstrating an understanding of the value of copyright to society would be a big step towards convincing me, and I think Ironholds as well, that you really understand what you are doing wrong when you cut and paste, or mildly reword, someone else&#39;s work. You&#39;ve yet to do that. IF you&#39;re confused let me be clear. I&#39;d like to see a &#39;why plagiarism is wrong and why copyright improves society&#39; essay of contrition from you. <a href="" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ThuranX">talk</a>) 11:51, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>←I suppose that most people reading this thread (at least if they read the last one) know that I take copyright situations seriously. Just for the record, I have been impressed with <a href="" title="User:Allstarecho">User:Allstarecho</a>&#39;s contributions to cleanup since his unblocking, which so far seem to be very much on the up and up (I have double-checked some, but not yet all) and which have gone a long way towards increasing my willingness to assume good faith from this point forward. Although I have seen multiple-article infringers blocked and unblocked before, I have never seen one of them actually apply himself to helping out with cleanup. Given his past, it is a good idea that a check be done in the future to be sure that infringement has not resumed (courts of law don&#39;t care about <a href="" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>; Wikipedia needs to exercise some responsible <a href="" title="due diligence">due diligence</a> with identified problem contributors), but at this point I&#39;m willing to cast my lot with <a href="" title="User:Quadell">User:Quadell</a> in believing that there may be no future problems here. I <i>would</i> encourage Allstarecho to seek feedback from somebody experienced with these issues if at any point he is unsure about a copyright situation. Better safe than sorry, since the likelihood that future inadvertent infringement could be misconstrued as intentional is high. --<a href="" title="User:Moonriddengirl">Moonriddengirl</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Moonriddengirl">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 13:16, 15 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>Just an impression from an outsider to the situation: Making a &#34;joke&#34; about someone&#39;s brain being &#34;60-watt&#34;, and then when it (very unsurprisingly) doesn&#39;t go well, giving the editor a link to the article <a href="" title="joke">joke</a>... is not respectful, professional, nor dignified behavior. It comes across as childish, contemptuous and condescending, and it&#39;s very likely to escalate a dispute. If you&#39;re in a disagreement with someone, making a joke (or whatever kind of insinuation, fore- or back-handed) that maybe they&#39;re dumb is a very, very bad idea. Until you change human nature, that&#39;s going to be a sure-fire way to increase the level of bad feelings, heat, drama, etc. I suggest some serious thought about what it means to interact respectfully and collegially. &#60;p&#62; Consider HarryAlffa, if I, in this post, were to suggest that maybe you&#39;re offending people because you&#39;re too stupid to avoid doing so... how would that come across to you? I do not, in fact, think that you&#39;re stupid, but I do think that you&#39;ve been careless. Again, this is just my impression. Don&#39;t take my word for it.

Rather terse? Some might say it was uncivil - but not me. I put a smiley face <b>:)</b> to indicate my reply to this was a <b>Joke</b>, I said I was trying to resist making a <b>Joke</b>. I even put &#60;code&#62;&#60;nowiki&#62;&#60;!--Yes, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve heard it before. --&#62;&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;/code&#62; in the wiki-code! To take it as an insult was unreasonable - I replied sarcasticly, no biggy, NOT disrespectful, unprofessional, undignified, childish, contemptuous or condescending. There is a difference between causing offence and taking offence. It was a bad joke we agree, as I indicated by my code-comment. <a href="" title="User:HarryAlffa">HarryAlffa</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:HarryAlffa">talk</a>) 21:27, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Like I said, it&#39;s just my impression. I find it helpful to avoid any references to anyone else&#39;s intelligence. Your mileage may vary. The definition of &#34;sarcasm&#34; includes the notion of contempt, which is not consistent with respect, at least not in contexts where that level of familiarity hasn&#39;t been established. Bad jokes are best not made. &#60;p&#62; Also, I didn&#39;t say you insulted him. That was clearly <i>not</i> your intention. However, look where we are now. If you had simply refrained from making the bad joke, then no offense would have resulted, and at what cost? How many threads like this one are bad jokes worth? We have to live w/ human nature as it is, not as we feel it should be. Something <i>likely</i> to cause offense is best avoided, whether or not taking offense would be sufficiently &#34;reasonable&#34;. The more clearly respectful and dignified your tone, the fewer misunderstandings. Seems like a good deal to me. &#60;p&#62; His preceding comment might or might not have been terse, uncivil, whatever. If so, then all the more reason to be especially careful. If someone else is borderline uncivil, then we are challenged to use civility to prevent conflict. Responding with a joke that refers to his intelligence.... didn&#39;t work this time. Two people perceived it as coming across rather badly. We may both be unreasonable, but if there are enough of us, then you either adapt, or you spend more and more time dealing with fallout from people not being as reasonably thick-skinned and joke-understanding-and-tolerant as you&#39;d like. &#60;p&#62; Oh, when I wrote &#34;comes across as childish, contemptuous and condescending&#34; I was referring to the &#34;helpful&#34; link to the <a href="" title="joke">joke</a> article that you gave him. Guess what percentage of the time that strategy successfully defuses a tense situation. My guess is that it&#39;s under 10%. Maybe I&#39;m wrong... -<a href="" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a>&#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 01:17, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Indeed there isn&#39;t; and given how long the existing approach has existed and how widely, a small discussion here between a handful of editors isn&#39;t sufficient to overturn that either in policy or in practice.

At what point do we draw a line and simply say, &#34;Enough, Harry.&#34; This editor has made little in the way of positive contributions, and any that he has made are far outweighed by the negative ones. He has stonewalled discussions, insulted and belittled productive editors, and (at one point) almost drove off one of the most dedicated editors in the Astronomy section. He cannot take &#34;no&#34; for an answer, and refuses to accept any opinion that does not mirror his own. To be perfectly honest, there is some benefit in Harry bringing his arguments here in that it has perhaps exposed his behaviour pattern to the wider community. --<b><a href="" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i>&#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Ckatz">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;chat&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz">&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;spy&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/small&#62;</i> 20:32, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

Sometimes one may want to do it in order to start a discussion (a very appropriate use of BRD) -- I&#39;ve done that myself once or twice--but then one must take the subsequent objections in a cooperative spirit, even if they are rather sharp, and move to discussing the issue, not the manner of making the or objecting to the change.

Would someone please tell this person that with the release of a major remake right now, there&#39;s no particular harm, and potentially some good, that can be done by having that hatnote in place. The IP editor seems to think that the only way to get to the page for the 1974 film is by typing in the full title of the article, and that obviates the need for re-direction of the reader elsewhere, but, in fact, there are <b><i>numerous</i></b> ways in which one can have arrived at the page via various links, and for those who get there mistakenly, the hatnote offers a pathway to reach where they want to go, which is presumably the article on the recent film.&#60;p&#62;This is a common sense vs. strict letter of the law thing, and I&#39;m tired of dealing with it.

<dd>That&#39;s a problem, particularly since it continued after the recent unblock.  A canonical example of unreliable sourcing is some random person&#39;s description at Flickr.  Putting that sort of joke into article space is dubious at best, and edit warring to reinstate it one day after gettting an indefinite block removed does not look good at all.  Is there some missing context to explain this?  Because as this stands it&#39;s very disappointing. &#60;font face=&#34;Verdana&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Durova">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#009&#34;&#62;Durova&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 01:19, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;m pretty sure that &#34;good faith&#34; is an irrelevant red herring. If someone&#39;s behavior is disruptive, it doesn&#39;t matter how good their faith is; the behavior has to stop. Stopping to make claims about the goodness or badness of their faith distracts from the important task of simply stopping them. &#60;p&#62; Every time I block a vandal, they <i>might be</i> acting in good faith, and just incredibly stupid. I don&#39;t care, so I don&#39;t mention their faith. Disruption must be prevented, independent of any considerations about &#34;faith&#34;. Just my 2 bits. -<a href="" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a>&#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 01:32, 16 June 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That&#39;s it exactly. I have arrived at the theory that even the most notorious vandals, such as that Grawp character, believe in their hearts that they&#39;re doing the right thing, or that what they&#39;re doing is justified somehow. So in that context, they are indeed acting &#34;in good faith&#34;. AGF thus is not really a very helpful concept. The question that should be asked about any edit is not &#34;Was it done in good faith?&#34;, but rather &#34;Does it fit within wikipedia guidelines (i.e. verifiable, notable, neutral, etc.)&#34; and &#34;Does it enhance the reader&#39;s knowledge?&#34; <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs">carrots</a> 16:32, 16 June 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It&#39;s still a helpful concept insofar as it reminds us to refrain from making motivation-based arguments. Those are weak arguments anyway, because they rest on a necessarily dubious conclusion. &#60;p&#62; If, on the other hand, the AGF concept simply inspires editors to identify behaviors that they believe &#34;excuse&#34; them from an obligation to assume good faith... that&#39;s actively harmful. The ideal would be to encourage a culture where arguments about others&#39; motivations are seen as not only irrelevant, but actively distracting and poisonous. &#60;p&#62; The mosquito biting my leg last night was absolutely acting in good faith - no question. If I had justified killing it by claiming it wasn&#39;t... that would be very stupid, and it would cause sensible people to question my reasoning, and rightly so. I killed it because it was sucking my blood, and I don&#39;t care one bit about its faith. Bugs is entirely correct about the right questions to be asking. -<a href="" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a>&#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 17:49, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>While hardly claiming to be an expert on glory holes ... I will disclose having been in quite a few sex clubs - it may have been research - and that image easily could be a glory hole from any of them or on someone&#39;s private property as a joke or any other number of scenarios, like a porn movie. It certainly looks like one and the words applied there also would infer that use so I would choose to accept it. That bad lighting? Most clubs have utility lighting in addition to the &#34;mood&#34; lighting. If it was a movie set they would likely have needed the lighting for the filming. Sorry, I see this as quibbling over a glory hole and aren&#39;t you terribly proud of that? <a href="" title="User_talk:Benjiboi">-- &#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px; font-family: cursive;color:#8000FF&#34;&#62;Banj&#60;font color=&#34;#FF4400&#34;&#62;e&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;&#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px;font-family: Zapfino, sans-serif;color:deeppink&#34;&#62;b&#60;font color=&#34;#CC0000&#34;&#62;oi&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;</a> 02:45, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<p>Amazing how this thread dealing with Damiens.rf&#39;s bad faith and harassment, has now turned into one about my bad faith. The fact is, I went looking for a better &#34;glory hole&#34; image than the one that was being used in the article. I found this alleged &#34;joke image&#34; on Flickr as a free image. I added it to Commons, and put it in the article. Nowhere on the damn Flickr page, at the time anyway as I haven&#39;t looked at it recently, does it say &#34;this is a joke image, it&#39;s not real, etc&#34;. What the Flickr source <i>did</i> say was a big damn in bold title <b>Ikea Glory Hole</b>. So I am supposed to guess and assume it&#39;s a some kind of &#34;joke&#34;? And because I didn&#39;t, Wikipedia has now fallen to its knees? Seriously, grow up. <b>-</b> <a href="" title="User:Allstarecho"><b>A</b>LLST<b>✰</b>R</a>&#60;span class=&#34;Unicode&#34; style=&#34;color:#FF72E3;&#34;&#62;▼&#60;/span&#62;<b>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Allstarecho">echo</a>&#60;/sup&#62;</b> &#60;sub&#62;<b><a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Allstarecho">wuz here</a> @</b>&#60;/sub&#62; 04:26, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I invite anyone reading this discussion to look at the image, which is perfectly inoffensive in case anyone is concerned about that, and judge for themselves. After having been informed (unnecessarily) that it was a joke, Allstarecho replaced the image, and even reverted an attempt by Mendaliv to qualify it as a &#34;possible&#34; glory hole. Another editor has no trouble <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Glory_hole_(sexual_slang)&#38;diff=296636597&#38;oldid=294987994" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Glory_hole_(sexual_slang)&#38;diff=296636597&#38;oldid=294987994">recognizing it for what it is</a>.

<dd>When Allstarecho claimed an ongoing wikihounding problem had been occurring for months he received an invitation to provide evidence; he provided no evidence.  Instead, other evidence was forthcoming that Allstarecho had edit warred to restore an unreliable claim after his recent unblock from an indef.  This has taken time out from two historic image restorations: one United States Capitol from the War of 1812, the other a portrait of John Quincy Adams.  Will be heading back to serious work now, and hoping this thread ends in a sensible result. &#60;font face=&#34;Verdana&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Durova">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#009&#34;&#62;Durova&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 06:06, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Part of the problem here is that we are dealing with a case where both parties have rather major issues. I myself have observed some rather antagonistic behaviour by Damiens.rf in completely unrelated areas to the discussion here, extending over some months and I think he even got blocked for it at one point. The behaviour of which Allstar is complaining is *entirely* consistent with what I saw then. On the other hand Allstar doesn&#39;t seem to have the highest assumption of good faith either because of the copyright issues and some past stoushes. These sort of situations are always the most difficult to resolve. <a href="" title="User talk:Orderinchaos">Orderinchaos</a> 08:03, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I agree to a point but on this glory hole thing ASE&#39;s assessment that it seems tangential is rather spot-on.

<dd>I wasn&#39;t reffering to your raising the glory hole issue as dickish I was pointing out that I agree that ASE&#39;s behaviour, while perhaps not model-like is not the main core of the issue. Indeed they seem to be teh model of how we want editors to take on criticism and help amend for issues they have adversely impacted. Your glory hole example above seems a bit of a dispute and I happen to agree that this wasn&#39;t just ASE being stubborn or a problem editor. In fact by those actions it shows they desisted. Personally I think a bit of discussion on the talkpage might have helped a bit. In any case their did indeed explain themselves and didn&#39;t seem to hound you or the other editor. This would seem like a totally different league compared to Damiens.rf tenditious goading and what smells like bullying/wikistalking. Just because we don&#39;t have some rule outlined not to be a jerk and hound other editors doesn&#39;t mean experienced editors like Damiens.rf should do so. Personally I felt it may just be an issue with LGBT topics but now it may just be a larger behavioural issue that has gone largely unchecked for months. I don&#39;t like digging through distasteful and uncivil comments and I&#39;ve never had a good experience with them. There are very few editors I can state such a thing about. This glory hole nonsense is rather distracting from some real damage being done to the volunteer community here. We don&#39;t encourage editors to act as taskmasters telling others what to fix and how and asking how soon can ___ be deleted? I&#39;ll give you X number of days and then the ax falls. Or filling up an article with unneeded fact tags or otherwise making such a stink on an article that admins have to be called in to stop it. It&#39;s a toxic approach to editing and makes the atmosphere of building consensus into a battleground instead. We don&#39;t need it. <a href="" title="User_talk:Benjiboi">-- &#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px; font-family: cursive;color:#8000FF&#34;&#62;Banj&#60;font color=&#34;#FF4400&#34;&#62;e&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;&#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px;font-family: Zapfino, sans-serif;color:deeppink&#34;&#62;b&#60;font color=&#34;#CC0000&#34;&#62;oi&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;</a> 15:21, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<p>Whomever placed the image over there ---&#62; certainly has a clue as that&#39;s how the image was described and presented originally at Flickr - as a glory hole found in an Ikea store - and is the only reason I uploaded it at Commons (that and because it had the appropriate license). Others, as seen in the timeline above, started removing it from the related article calling it a &#34;joke image&#34; even though it said no such thing remotely close to &#34;this is a joke&#34; at the Flickr source. I&#39;ve done nothing wrong here and this sub-thread should either be collapsed or moved to its own section as it has nothing to do with the main thread and Damiens.rf&#39;s behavior. <b>-</b> <a href="" title="User:Allstarecho"><b>A</b>LLST<b>✰</b>R</a>&#60;span class=&#34;Unicode&#34; style=&#34;color:#FF72E3;&#34;&#62;▼&#60;/span&#62;<b>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Allstarecho">echo</a>&#60;/sup&#62;</b> &#60;sub&#62;<b><a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Allstarecho">wuz here</a> @</b>&#60;/sub&#62; 16:35, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>ASE, at this point I can&#39;t help but think that you &#34;<a href="" title="Hamlet">doth protest too much</a>.&#34; Not that I have any personal experiences with using glory holes, but I&#39;ve seen them, and even the most cursory of glances at that photo pretty clearly indicates that it&#39;s a sink. The stainless steel, sharp edges, and very small size should have all been big clues. Fun and games is all well and good, but I cannot at this point believe that you sincerely thought it was an actual photo of an actual glory hole at an <a href="" title="IKEA">IKEA</a>, of all places. It&#39;s either that or you have absolutely no ability to actually evaluate sources for their veracity and merely take them on faith. Even if that were the case, though, you should revisit what we have to say about <a href="" title="WP:SPS">self-published sources</a>, which flickr most certainly is. In the final analysis, it doesn&#39;t matter whether you knew it was a joke, whether you simply accept any source you see as accurate, or whether you don&#39;t understand the problem with self-published sources, as the end result is the same: something that is <i>factually incorrect</i> that you engaged in a slow-motion edit war over including. Whether or not you were acting in good faith is likewise immaterial, and I for one utterly fail to believe you have acted in good faith on an enormous number of occasions. Sorry to be so harsh, but I&#39;m not really interested in mincing words here: your behaviour throughout the copyvio problem was massively disruptive, and while I don&#39;t have time to hunt through your contribs to look for similar issues to the one raised with this photo, based on your patterns of behaviour thus far I would be unsurprised to find more. As someone said somewhere above, it doesn&#39;t matter if you are acting in good faith, because the end result is bad, and repetitively so. <a href="" title="User:Who then was a gentleman?">User:Who then was a gentleman?</a> pointed out yesterday, and I have come to agree somewhat (though not completely) that <i>whether or not</i> Damiens.rf has been stalking you, he has in fact raised some very valid concerns about your behaviour. These are now two separate issues: dealing with his behaviour (for which I hope a permanent ban is coming soon), and dealing with yours--which at this point, especially given your behaviour with the copyvios, I have some difficulty seeing why the solution should be any different. After all, the community consensus was <i>against</i> your unblock, and yet here you are--still refusing to acknowledge your behaviour (albeit a new behaviour this time), and, frankly, acting incredibly disingenuous when called on it. I strongly suggest you re-evaluate your reactions and change your behaviour accordingly. //<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#4B0082;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>roux</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #4B0082;-moz-border-radius-topright:10px;-moz-border-radius-bottomleft:10px;padding:0px 7px;font-size:30%;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a> 17:11, 16 June 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;

<dd>Roux, I usually respect and value your opinion but on this one, you are wrong and way off base. Frankly, it does not matter whether you believe that I actually thought this was a glory hole or not. What does matter is the facts, which are again: I went looking for a free image to use in the related article to give variety to the imagery presented. I found this free image on Flicker titled <b>Ikea Glory Hole</b>. It also had/has the description at Flickr <b><i>Found in Ikea. For boys only.</i></b>. Nowhere does it say &#34;could be&#34; or &#34;possible&#34; or &#34;just kidding&#34; or &#34;this is a joke&#34;. I uploaded the image to Commons, because it&#39;s a free image. I placed the image in the related article. It was removed by a user proclaiming it as a <i>humorously labeled as</i> glory hole. I went back and looked at the source. Again, nowhere at the source was any such indication that it was in jest, a joke or humor. I re-added it back to the article with a notation that no such &#34;humor&#34; claim was at the source. I&#39;m not a hardware expert and certainly not full of knowledge in regards to what may be a sink from such a vague in regards-to-sinks image. There&#39;s nothing else I can say about this. I know what I did and why I did it and nothing I did was wrong or against any policy. <b>-</b> <a href="" title="User:Allstarecho"><b>A</b>LLST<b>✰</b>R</a>&#60;span class=&#34;Unicode&#34; style=&#34;color:#FF72E3;&#34;&#62;▼&#60;/span&#62;<b>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Allstarecho">echo</a>&#60;/sup&#62;</b> &#60;sub&#62;<b><a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Allstarecho">wuz here</a> @</b>&#60;/sub&#62; 18:30, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;d been avoiding chiming in here, but I&#39;ve got to say I don&#39;t think ASE has done <i>anything</i> wrong in uploading the image and marking it as a gloryhole. However, I strongly object to his position above which suggests he&#39;s being accused of wrongdoing in having (mis)identified that image as one of a genuine gloryhole. The problem is ASE&#39;s manner of approaching the questioning of something he just happens to have uploaded. I don&#39;t think he was wrong to defend his contributions- we&#39;d all likely do the same- but his manner in my view was objectionable as evidenced by the diffs provided by Delicious carbuncle. However, I agree that there&#39;s nothing worthy of action (administrative or otherwise) in this specific situation. &#38;mdash;/<a href="" title="User:Mendaliv">&#60;b&#62;M&#60;/b&#62;&#60;small&#62;endaliv&#60;/small&#62;</a>/&#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Mendaliv">2¢</a>&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;/&#60;sub&#62;&#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Mendaliv">Δ&#39;s</a>&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sub&#62;/ 18:24, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Jackie that isn&#39;t helpful. We&#39;ve pointed you towards the policies and guidelines that govern how articles are written and what material is included in them.  Please read them.  And yes I have read Campbell along with many other works hence I see how little weight it deserves in the context of a global overview of the whole subject of feminism, or indeed an article on feminist theology.  I&#39;ve advised you a number of times taht a smaller better sourced version of the material you added would be useful in another article like <a href="" title="Feminism and Religion">Feminism and Religion</a>.

<dd>Jackiestud, stop now. My actions at the Portuguese Wikipedia are of no importance here (because I really don&#39;t do anything there unless I&#39;ve found vandalism here that poured over to the other language projects, which happens every now and then). Your actions here are at question. If you continue to edit war on the English Wikipedia you will be blocked from editing the English Wikipedia.

<dd>(Warning on ANI and user talk page)</dd>
<dd>Jackiestud - you are clearly being too rude in responding to your critics here and elsewhere.  This is not appropriate behavior on the english language Wikipedia.  Please review <a href="" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a>, <a href="" title="WP:NPA">WP:NPA</a>, <a href="" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, and edit in a more collaborative and friendly way moving forwards.</dd>
<dd>Regarding your content edits, you appear to be repeatedly reinserting material which a consensus of other editors believes is fringe material, not mainstream, and you are trying to give <a href="" title="WP:UNDUE">undue weight</a> to it.  This is against policy.  You are also conducting a widespread <a href="" title="WP:EDITWAR">edit war</a> over that material.  Once you were made aware that many other editors (all of them, on those pages, apparently) do not agree with you including it, you are required to stop reposting it over and over again and to discuss the issue on article talk pages.  You appear instead to primarily be fighting in other venues.</dd>
<dd>This all is very disruptive, taken as a whole.</dd>
<dd>I am assuming good faith and giving you some credit for not having english as your first language.  But you are pushing too hard here, and this is not ok.  I or other administrators will block you if you continue this behavior.  You need to calm down your edit tone and respond more politely, and discuss your edits in good faith on article talk pages.</dd>

<dd>Hmmm yeah.  So basically even if the info stays the material has to be rewritten to avoid license breach - just great *sigh*.

<dd>I&#39;d like to add to this. He is continually posting at <a href="" title="Talk:Amesbury Archer">Talk:Amesbury Archer</a> in a way that I would call spam more than anything else. I know enough about the subject to be able to work out that he clearly doesn&#39;t know anything about it. At the risk of making a personal attack (not my intent here, I just want to tell you how I see it) judging from his methods of ignoring questions raised on the talk page and trying to extend an argument, I think he&#39;s only here as a persistent vandal (or <a href="" title="WP:troll">WP:troll</a>), not to contribute anything meaningful to articles. This would seem to be backed up by the problems other editors are having with him. I have no intention to hide facts about the article and would only welcome its expansion in a logical and meaningful form, unfortunately his edits seem designed to antagonise other editors so that he can have an argument. His insistence that anyone disagreeing with him is pushing a British POV is totally nonsensical on an article about Ancient History, yet he&#39;s doing it. I&#39;m happy to be open about the facts of the Amesbury Archer and have even incorporated some of his views into the article, but his offensive tone, continual PA&#39;s and questioning of other editors knowledge and motivations is pathetic. Even got me a bit annoyed for a moment. Cheers <a href="" title="User:Ranger Steve">Ranger Steve</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ranger Steve">talk</a>) 19:45, 15 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>For what it&#39;s worth I think he just likes arguing with people on talk pages.  He&#39;ll ignore your questions and then accuse you of exactly what he&#39;s guilty of, constantly trying to get people to rise to his baits.  At <a href="" title="Amesbury Archer">Amesbury Archer</a> it looks to me as if he watched a BBC <a href="" title="Timewatch">Timewatch</a> program called Stonehenge Decoded (I think it was broadcast in the States with Carrie Fisher narrating it) and is basing all his arguments off of it, trying to come across as an expert.  I can see from his comments that he knows very little beyond this, and I suspect the same is true at other articles he edits.  It&#39;s amusing that one BBC article is Gods truth, but another is totally wrong because it disagrees - but only he is in a position to judge this for us.  That alone shows his intent I think, and leads to his next ploy to start a fight - insulting everyone he can as quickly as possible <a href="" title="User:Ranger Steve">Ranger Steve</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ranger Steve">talk</a>) 23:40, 15 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

For over 1 year, a persistent and monothematic vandal (originally calling himself User:Dr90s) has been engaged in a vandalistic campaign on Wikipedia to remove all references to or to downplay as much as possible the achievements of video game designer, <a href="" title="Shigeru Miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a>. The person who is vandalising Wikipedia in this way has used and continues to use sockpuppet accounts to fool other editors into the belief that his edits have broad support. Due to the length of time this vandal has been operating, many of his edits have become semi-ingrained in the articles, and I think this is extremely harmful to Wikipedia as a project. As I mentioned in one of the many SPI reports I have filed on this vandal, I believe these edits skirt the edge of defamation of character. Mr. Miyamoto is a living person and the removal/downplay of his achievements on Wikipedia may adversely affect his professional and personal reputation. As it states at <a href="" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, &#34;[f]rom both a legal and ethical standpoint it is essential that a determined effort be made to eliminate defamatory and other undesirable information from these articles as far as possible.&#34;</p>
<p>I do not wish to waste anyone&#39;s time and I recognize that the <a href="" title="WP:SPI">Sock Puppet Investigations</a> is probably the best place to go with matters such as this, but I have a few specific suggestions for <b>partial solutions which can only be achieved through AN/I</b>. Please don&#39;t simply disregard or move this request before at least considering the suggestions below (especially those under the heading &#34;ArbCom Sanctions&#34;). In addition, I was wondering if there were any ideas for <i>further</i> actions I could take to try to curb this malicious editor&#39;s vandalistic impulses.</p>
<p>Filing SPI reports takes me a very long time (digging up difs of well-disguised vandalism and trying to differentiate between sleeper socks and normal editors), and unfortunately I seem to be the only editor willing to make the report. I am concerned that the people at SPI will soon tire of my constant reports (my most recent report was on June 12, 2009 and the one previous to this was on June 9, 2009). Knowing this editor&#39;s pattern of sock-based vandalism as well as I do and knowing this vandal&#39;s history of creating sleeper accounts, I always request the use of <a href="" title="WP:CHECK">CheckUser</a> at SPI. This is a powerful tool and the folks at SPI are naturally reluctant to use it every time I request it (according to <a href="" title="WP:CHECK">WP:CHECK</a> it is only to be used &#34;exceedingly rarely&#34;). Unfortunatley, this results in the further ingraining of malicious defamation of Mr. Miyamoto at Wikipedia until the evidence becomes so overwhelming that the use of CheckUser cannot be avoided. This may take months, and unfortunately there is no &#34;clean-up crew&#34; assigned to mitigate the effects of the defamatory edits that have now become part of Wikipedia. As a brief example, I just today cleaned up some vandalism left by a prior sockpuppet that had lingered since November 2008! While I haven&#39;t given up on SPI by any means, in this regard at least it is failing to correct the problem insofar as it applies a mere &#34;band-aid&#34; patch to cure deep wound.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, this vandal is extremely adept at dodging blocks, and I know of at least one account that is still active and that was created only hours after the latest June 14, 2009 SPI-imposed mass-blocking of 8 puppets (bringing this user to a total of 26 blocked accounts). This new account is <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;user=Akane7000" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;user=Akane7000">User:Akane7000</a>, and his last edit was yesterday. There is a large record on file at SPI for the puppetmaster and his socks. There are also several older reports that do not show up in the SPI archives. I have not traced this matter to its origin, however to make matters easier for those who wish to examine the full history, I present for your consideration a partial summary of offical action taken so far:

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Specific_AN.2FI_Help_Requested">Specific AN/I Help Requested</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="ArbCom_Sanctions">ArbCom Sanctions</span></h4>
<p>In order to be successful in a request for use of CheckUser, a requesting editor must show that the accused puppet diplays at least one (<i>and preferably several</i>) of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A - Evasion of bans or other remedies issued by the arbitration committee (closed cases only)</li>
<li>B - Ongoing, serious pattern vandalism involving dozens of incidents</li>
<li>C - Vote fraud for a closed vote where the possible sockpuppet votes affect the outcome</li>
<li>D - 3RR violation using socks</li>
<li>E - Evasion of community-based bans or blocks</li></ul>
<p>or
</p>
<ul>
<li>F - Request doesn&#39;t fit any of the criteria but you believe a check is warranted anyway</li></ul>

<p>Because SPI is a non-arbitration group, my only consistently valid reason to request CheckUser has been Code E. Apparently Codes B and D apply only to the currently accused sock and as this vandal&#39;s vandalistic edits are spread over a great number of socks, and as I am usually largely unaware of them all, I am unable to furnish proof of the requisite 24 (i.e. two dozen) vandalistic/3RR-violative edits. Although a Dr90s votestacking (Code C) violation can be seen <a href="#TopTenReviews" title="WP:Articles for deletion/Log/2008 May 28">at this 2008 AfD</a>, the only times the puppetmaster has attempted a Code C <i>recently</i> (e.g. <a href="#Thibbs_reported_by_Reviewer100_.28Result:_Reporter_blocked.29" title="WP:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/3RRArchive87">Dec &#39;08 AN/3RR reporting</a>, <a href="#List_of_Nintendo_games_created_by_Shigeru_Miyamoto" title="WP:Articles for deletion/Log/2009 May 7">May &#39;09 AfD voting</a>, etc.), the votes went against him and so he cannot be said to have &#34;affect[ed] the outcome[s].&#34;</p>
<p>I am hoping that the ArbCom can impose a block on <a href="" title="User:Dr90s">User:Dr90s</a>&#39; most recent puppet, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;user=Akane7000" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;user=Akane7000">User:Akane7000</a> so that a record can be created on this vandal and so that my future work at SPI in this regard can be streamlined. If it helps my case at all, an earlier report on this vandal was filed with AN/I in October 2008 by retired <a href="" title="User:The Prince of Darkness">User:The Prince of Darkness</a>. This report can be found <a href="#User:43.244.132.168" title="WP:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/IncidentArchive485">here</a>. Although it is true that this matter may arguably be more properly under the jurisdiction of WP:SPI, I think that an ArbCom ban is warranted in this case and could help with this problem greatly. -<a href="" title="User:Thibbs">Thibbs</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Thibbs">talk</a>) 16:31, 15 June 2009 (UTC)</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Page_Protection">Page Protection</span></h4>
<p>I have considered requesting protection for pages that seem to be particular targets for this vandalistic editor, however I don&#39;t believe that accounts like User:Akane7000 will be blocked by mere Semi-protection, and I worry that Full protection may render prior acts of vandalism uncorrectable, and may furthermore be largely ineffective against this kind of vandalism insofar as the underlying theme covers a great number of pages (Mr. Miyamoto has designed a great number of games and references to this are scattered across more than 50 pages). I welcome any sugestions for creative solutions involving page protection. -<a href="" title="User:Thibbs">Thibbs</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Thibbs">talk</a>) 16:31, 15 June 2009 (UTC)</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Designated_Admin">Designated Admin</span></h4>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if such a thing is possible, but I was wondering if I could be assigned an administrator to whom I can report all matters involving Dr90s in order to simplify the sockpuppet reporting phase for myself. A previous administrator (<a href="" title="User:Hermione1980">User:Hermione1980</a>) who had been a first-hand witness to an earlier round of Dr90s sockpuppeting had volunteered to be the do just this on December 17, 2008 (see <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThe_Legend_of_Zelda%3A_Ocarina_of_Time&#38;diff=258582341&#38;oldid=258499236" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AThe_Legend_of_Zelda%3A_Ocarina_of_Time&#38;diff=258582341&#38;oldid=258499236">relevant difs</a>), however she has since retired (see <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHermione1980&#38;diff=281507713&#38;oldid=280337605" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AHermione1980&#38;diff=281507713&#38;oldid=280337605">her &#34;goodbye&#34; dif</a>). I can honestly say that I have no vested interests in the underlying matters on which this vandal is editing. My edit history reflects as much. My only concerns are that a blocked user is evading community sanctions and that a living person (Mr. Miyamoto) is suffering the maligning of his professional and personal character on the pages of Wikipedia. -<a href="" title="User:Thibbs">Thibbs</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Thibbs">talk</a>) 16:31, 15 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well, a complex situation at face value, but really, we just have a sockmaster who is pretty persistent, right? Having reviewed the SPI case(s), your contributions, the relevant page histories, and the sock&#39;s editing style, I think it&#39;s pretty straightforward identification - the duck test is applicable here. I&#39;d be willing to be your go-to guy in this situation. If other admins (and non-admins) concur, I think this is the most reasonable solution. Page protection doesn&#39;t seem like an option at this point. FWIW, I blocked the most recent sock Akane. <a href="" title="User:Tanthalas39">&#60;font color=&#34;#CC7722&#34; face=&#34;Papyrus&#34;&#62;<b>Tan</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>  &#38;#124;  <a href="" title="User talk:Tanthalas39">&#60;font color=&#34;#21421E&#34; face=&#34;Papyrus&#34;&#62;39&#60;/font&#62;</a> 16:46, 15 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd><b>Support:</b> I won&#39;t pretend to understand all of the procedural stuff that goes on here (though I sympathize with admins for having to put up with all the ridiculous nonsense that the anonymity of the Internet incurs). However, I greatly support anything that will simplify and expedite dealing with Dr90s&#39; persistent POV editing and circumventing of blocks with socks. <a href="" title="User:DKqwerty">DKqwerty</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DKqwerty">talk</a>) 23:51, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I don&#39;t know what this person&#39;s agenda is, but if he&#39;s trolling a specific group of articles, then I suggest we get some help monitoring those articles. This may or may not count as <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Canvassing">canvassing</a>, but would it be alright to post a notice at the <a href="" title="WT:VG">Video games project&#39;s talk page</a> and its <a href="" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Video games/Nintendo">Nintendo task force talk page</a>? The more eyes looking, the easier it will be to identify the socks right? We just need to tell VG project members what to look for and have them direct the activity to Thibbs to analyze it (if that&#39;s alright with Thibbs). Any thoughts?

<dl>
<dd>I&#39;d be happy to help however I can. As long as I&#39;m around, I will gladly discuss the edits of suspicious-looking Dr90s suspects. If I think there is substantial evidence, then I will turn the matter over to Tanthalas39, AN/I, or SPI. I think one of the biggest things is to maintain a level of awareness that this is an ongoing situation. Sadly I&#39;m pretty sure this editor will be around for quite a long time... -<a href="" title="User:Thibbs">Thibbs</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Thibbs">talk</a>) 19:27, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Wow, my second legal-threat-related issue of the day. I&#39;m special. Or I&#39;m a shit magnet, one of the two. </p>
<p>Please review <a href="#Vandalism_and_the_destruction_of_the_article_on_the_Canadian_Children.27s_Rights_Council-Vandalism_by_WLU_who_took_off_all_links_into_the_CanadianCRC_on_Wikipedia" title="User talk:Tony Fox">this section on my talk page</a>, wherein a brand new editor has made some complaints regarding some issues claimed at <a href="" title="Talk:Canadian Children&#39;s Rights Council">Talk:Canadian Children&#39;s Rights Council</a>. I have no idea why I was picked for this, I&#39;ve never dealt with the page before. It appears there are a number of editors involved there with these issues. The latest comments on my talk page are an obvious legal threat, so I&#39;ve blocked. However, it looks like there&#39;s some further issues here that should be looked at, so as I&#39;m unavailable for a few days I&#39;ll leave it for further review. If there&#39;s a consensus to unblock, feel free - I won&#39;t be online to discuss beyond this post.

<dd><a href="" title="Canadian Children&#39;s Rights Council">Canadian Children&#39;s Rights Council</a> is the article in dispute.  In our Talk pages this group is sometimes referred to as the CCRC, though the article doesn&#39;t use that abbreviation for them. There is also a Canadian Coalition on the Rights of Children, which has the same initials. A 2008 book by Erica Burman, cited in our article, claims that the Council &#34;<a class="externallink" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=d9FAxcSmuWgC&#38;pg=PA170#PPA170,M1" rel="nofollow" title="http://books.google.com/books?id=d9FAxcSmuWgC&#38;pg=PA170#PPA170,M1">usurped the acronym of the Canadian Coalition on the Rights of the Child</a>.&#34; (Note that her claim would be more convincing if she used the correct name of the other group). I have no opinion on this, but it may explain some of the sharp remarks by the legal-threateners who are so upset with us. My impression is that the name this organization wants to use for itself is <i>Canadian Children&#39;s Rights Council-Conseil Canadien des Droits de l&#39;Enfant</i>, i.e. the English and French names joined by a hyphen. See the article Talk page for more. It is possible that this group has itself been involved in court cases about its name, so if it is a simple matter for us to sort this out, we should do so. They don&#39;t seem to object to CanadianCRC as an abbreviation. Within the last month the abbreviation &#39;CCRC&#39; has been taken out of the article, which is good. But in spite of this, I fully support Tony Fox&#39;s block of <a href="" title="User_talk:MSLTT">MSLTT</a> for making legal threats. Backers of the CanadianCRC have already received well-deserved attention at ANI and lots of admin sanctions have been issued. <a href="" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:EdJohnston">talk</a>) 19:31, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>The issue was easily fixed (indeed, you&#39;ve fixed it);</li>
<li>You posted on Shortride&#39;s talk page then came straight here.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>Thanks for fixing this issue, however your attitude towards Shortride seems quite <a href="" title="WP:BITE">WP:BITEy</a>. Next time I&#39;d suggest (a) fixing the problem, and (b) dropping a <i>polite</i> note on the editor&#39;s talk page <i>explaining</i> the issue.

<dd>I have to respectfully disagree:
<ul>
<li>Shortride has been editing since December 2006 that&#39;s not a few months.</li>
<li>It&#39;d also be &#34;easy to fix&#34; a vandal replacing birth date 1910 with 1492, that wouldn&#39;t make it any more an acceptable behavior.</li>
<li>I came straight here because someone wantonly removing such an extensively clear tag documenting rules has no right to the sort of &#34;AGF&#34; or &#34;BITE&#34; laxism under which most vandals spam or damage the encyclopedia for weeks or months before any sort of retribution. And even if you can somehow believe in his good faith, you wouldn&#39;t make him any service by allowing him to continue operating under the delusion that there are no rules and that his blatant disregard for even the most explicit tag is anything less than unacceptable.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>I&#39;d counter-suggest that he should get a one-hour block with summary &#34; blatant violation of <a href="" title="WP:MOSTM">WP:MOSTM</a> in <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Time_Warner&#38;diff=295338213&#38;oldid=292636102" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Time_Warner&#38;diff=295338213&#38;oldid=292636102">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Time_Warner&#38;diff=295338213&#38;oldid=292636102</a> &#34; so that it&#39;s on the record and he can&#39;t fool any more people on his next offenses. <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/62.147.39.186">62.147.39.186</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:62.147.39.186">talk</a>) 19:36, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>You&#39;re quite right; somehow I managed to muddle the dates of the later posts with the first post on the talk page. That said, I <i>did</i> check the history of the talk page, and there didn&#39;t seem to be any previous posting raising this issue there - yours was the first, and straight after posting you came here without waiting for a reply. Discussing this <i>is</i> doing the editor a service. Incidentally, blocks aren&#39;t for &#34;retribution&#34; - they&#39;re to prevent disruption. They also don&#39;t typically come &#34;out of the blue&#34; - they follow a series of warnings. Right now this editor appears to be oblivious to policy - they&#39;ve had no warnings, just one post on their talk page and then... whack! Block! Well, hopefully not.</dd>
<dd>I&#39;ll leave it to an admin to decide whether this merits a block; for my part I&#39;d suggest discussing it with them <i>first</i>, <a href="" title="WP:TROUT">slapping</a> them <i>second</i>, and only blocking if they persist. For some reason HTML comments do seem to be invisible to many editors - I suspect people mentally parse out anything between &#60;nowiki&#62;&#60;!--&#60;/nowiki&#62; and &#60;nowiki&#62;--&#62;&#60;/nowiki&#62;.</dd>

<p>&#34;We cannot help the English as a second language issues that you seem to have.

<p>These remarks, when viewed each in their own right, might seem minor or even partially justified (which I assure you they are not). Taken together, they form a pattern of a personal attack aimed at making any intersection with WAS a miserable experience, with the likely purpose of removing my opposition to various of his edits and proposals.</p>
<p>Character witnesses against WAS as an editor with a longstanding tradition of making personal attacks I have gathered previously in <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts&#38;diff=292872814&#38;oldid=292856142" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts&#38;diff=292872814&#38;oldid=292856142">this edit</a>.

<p>The following quote put on his talk page in 2006 might be illustrative &#34;Just because you are technically correct does not justify your attitude. You don&#39;t own this project, we are all working together. Misunderstandings can be handled in a civilized manner, with both parties being treated respectfully.

<p>Okay, now I&#39;m cranky. There are several IPs that have been trying to insert what they say is a &#34;court ordered statement&#34; into the above article for some time now, despite multiple editors&#39; attempts to explain that this is an encyclopedia article and we couldn&#39;t really give a flying fuck what a judge in Washington State told the subject it could or couldn&#39;t do. I even e-mailed Mike Godwin about it a while back, to no response, which suggests there&#39;s no issue on our part. </p>
<p>So what do we get today?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ted_Schmidt"><a href="" title="Ted Schmidt">Ted Schmidt</a></span></h2>

<p>This former article-turned-redirect (about a character from a TV series) has been turned into a new article about a real talent agent.  Both   and   have been making the same edits to this article.  The edits are a significant copyvio of <a class="externallink" href="http://www.epluri.com/TSA/TSAstuff/TSAcompanyhistory.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.epluri.com/TSA/TSAstuff/TSAcompanyhistory.html">http://www.epluri.com/TSA/TSAstuff/TSAcompanyhistory.html</a> .  When I reverted the changes and notified both users, they reinserted the text, claiming that they were Ted Schmidt, and that they were releasing the text into the public domain.  I again reverted the changes, and notified both users, via the boilerplate messages, about creating autobiographies, with a note attached to see <a href="" title="WP:Donating copyrighted materials">WP:Donating copyrighted materials</a> for how to properly release their text into the public domain.  Thermalsnowball&#39;s response was to reinsert the text into the article, and to copy-and-paste <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Email_templates">commons:Commons:Email templates</a> at the bottom of the article.  Once again, I reverted the changes, and left a note on Thermalsnowball&#39;s talk page, specifically spelling out what he needed to do.  This time around, 72.144.106.128 reinserted the exact same text that Thermalsnowball inserted.  I don&#39;t think this person/persons is/are getting the picture, can I get someone else to step in?

<p>Okay, now I&#39;m cranky. There are several IPs that have been trying to insert what they say is a &#34;court ordered statement&#34; into the above article for some time now, despite multiple editors&#39; attempts to explain that this is an encyclopedia article and we couldn&#39;t really give a flying fuck what a judge in Washington State told the subject it could or couldn&#39;t do. I even e-mailed Mike Godwin about it a while back, to no response, which suggests there&#39;s no issue on our part. </p>
<p>So what do we get today? The reversion, yet again, and <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Eastside_Sun&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296607720" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Eastside_Sun&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296607720">this</a>, which smells like a legal threat to me. Could some other admins please look this over?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Ted_Schmidt"><a href="" title="Ted Schmidt">Ted Schmidt</a></span></h2>

<p>This former article-turned-redirect (about a character from a TV series) has been turned into a new article about a real talent agent.  Both   and   have been making the same edits to this article.  The edits are a significant copyvio of <a class="externallink" href="http://www.epluri.com/TSA/TSAstuff/TSAcompanyhistory.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.epluri.com/TSA/TSAstuff/TSAcompanyhistory.html">http://www.epluri.com/TSA/TSAstuff/TSAcompanyhistory.html</a> .  When I reverted the changes and notified both users, they reinserted the text, claiming that they were Ted Schmidt, and that they were releasing the text into the public domain.  I again reverted the changes, and notified both users, via the boilerplate messages, about creating autobiographies, with a note attached to see <a href="" title="WP:Donating copyrighted materials">WP:Donating copyrighted materials</a> for how to properly release their text into the public domain.  Thermalsnowball&#39;s response was to reinsert the text into the article, and to copy-and-paste <a href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Email_templates">commons:Commons:Email templates</a> at the bottom of the article.  Once again, I reverted the changes, and left a note on Thermalsnowball&#39;s talk page, specifically spelling out what he needed to do.  This time around, 72.144.106.128 reinserted the exact same text that Thermalsnowball inserted.  I don&#39;t think this person/persons is/are getting the picture, can I get someone else to step in?

<dd>That&#39;s a pretty nasty attack, but it was in response to a 3RR warning for a single revert.

<dd>And finally I ACCUSE administrator Toddst1 of harrassing me because he keeps using my <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&#38;page=User:Maurice27" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/block&#38;page=User:Maurice27">block log</a> as a reason to accuse me.

<dl>
<dd>So, here we are, a bunch of defenseless editors who really discussed for days and weeks in order to find a consensus and a single anon user who is having fun blowing up everything, reverting us, not explaining in talk-page, with the complete <b>permissivity</b> of an administrator who just doesn&#39;t care about the sake of the article. </dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>Toddst1 has proven today that he was observing and watching the Revision history of <a href="" title="Catalan people">Catalan people</a>. As soon as I came close to breaking 3RR, he jumped to my user-page to warn me. He didn&#39;t prevent the (close to) 40 reverts by the anon... Just like I was his only interest. He wants me blocked. Why hasn&#39;t he done anything to protect the article? Why hasn&#39;t he answered to the other editor&#39;s requests? Because he only wants to harrass me. Where is the <b>Good Faith</b> assuption? Where is the <b>No personal attacks</b> guideline? NOWHERE! </dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>If you want to block me? I can only tell you all to go ahead! I believe that the sake of Wikipedia is far above us all and I <b>keep</b> believing that administrator <b>Toddst1</b> has <b>reacted negligently</b> in this case and that he has <b>abused</b> of his administrator &#34;power&#34; with me.

<p>Wow, this is exactly the kind of bickering that puts anybody off wikipedia and, therefore, this will be my one-hit wonder contribution and then I&#39;ll leave this sad bickering. But, if the truth be told, I think user Toddst1 should take a deep breath and honestly tell himself wether he is in this dispute with a clear mind or less so, not the least because he is an administrator and he is supposed to abide to some neutrality (and effectiveness, I&#39;d dare to say) standards.</p>
<p>To put a little context, there was a dispute over the Catalan people article (in which I was not even participating at that point). On the one side there was Coentor and on the other Maurice, they were both discussing as politely as it gets about the content, while an anon who refused to discuss or even to articulate his point of view at the talk page, kept adding it at his own risk, absolutely disregarding the discussion going on at the talk page.</p>
<p>Then Todd came in, and, as an administrator, all he did was to block the page (more or less where the anon had left it, therefore olympically ignoring the two main articulated points of view at the talk page) and call for a consensus to be reached. Then he disappeared. That is much less than I would expect from an admin. but I guess it is correct anyway.</p>
<p>In the process, he had given Maurice a warning, while did absolutely nothing about the disturbing anon.</p>
<p>Then protection expired and, finally, a consensus has been reached between at least four editors (including the aforementioned Coentor, Maurice, Cnoguera and myself, all with quite diverse points of view, but willing to compromise in the end). Still, the anon keeps fighting his own war, while refusing to discuss whatsoever. </p>
<p>Now, next thing I hear about userToddst is when one of the parties involved in the consensus building asked him to semiprotect the page in order to block the disruptive anon, so that we can all move on. This is all Todd had to say in return <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Toddst1&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=296611018" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Toddst1&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=296611018"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Toddst1&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=296611018" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Toddst1&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=296611018">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Toddst1&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=296611018</a></a>. And this is when an admin. starts to tread so low that you wonder what is the use of admins., if any.</p>
<p>So now it does get worrysome about his will to help the users who are discussing and building the very same consensus he asked for (before he left us in oblivion).</p>
<p>Todd, with all due respect, if all you are going to make is block a contested page in the version with the least support, then give dry replies to one of the civil users and, in the meantime, try to block a third user whom you dont like mostly his past record (including that message he left in your talk page one month ago)...I think a mere bot, not an admin. could do. If you are not going to be a part of the solution, try at least to not be a part of the problem, like when you keep endorsing (not with your words, but with your actions) the disrupting anon, like when you keep tracking the involved users bringing up past grudges.</p>
<p>A bot at least does not have revenge feelings or an ego to be vindicated. And it looks like whatever Maurice told you did sit bad with you and you are devoting your energies rather than in helping the article to improve, in getting one of the consensus-builders blocked, basically because of his past record elsewhere (and because he spoke less than nice to you once or twice).</p>
<p>Now, as I said, I won&#39;t be adding more about this. I have better stuff to do in wikipedia than arguing with strangers for the sake of arguing. In any case, Todd, I do hope that I can still sleep tight and walk through wikipedia&#39;s manors more or less carefree. In other words, I hope that you have not added me to your &#34;to do&#34; list now because of this post... &#60;b&#62;&#60;font face=&#34;Book Antiqua&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;MOUNTOLIVE&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/b&#62; <a href="" title="User talk:Mountolive">&#60;sub&#62;fedeli alla linea&#60;/sub&#62;</a> 01:37, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>It might not be clear, so I will note that <a href="" title="User:Mountolive">User:Mountolive</a> is posting here in response to a talk page request by <a href="" title="User:Maurice27">User:Maurice27</a>. I will also note that the above accounts are incorrect in a couple of respects, e.g.
</p>
<ul>
<li>the statement &#34;My last block occured 29 November 2007. That&#39;s a year and half!!!&#34; was missing the <i>clarification</i> &#34;if you ignore my block of 10 May 2009...&#34;</li>
<li>the statement &#34;he had given Maurice a warning, while did absolutely nothing about the disturbing anon&#34; ignored the warning that <a href="" title="User:Toddst1">User:Toddst1</a> <i>did</i> provide at <a href="" title="User talk:81.44.100.87">User talk:81.44.100.87</a>. When asked about this point, Mountolive <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMountolive&#38;diff=296884382&#38;oldid=296878102" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMountolive&#38;diff=296884382&#38;oldid=296878102">stated</a> that they are not interested in reconsidering their statement above.</li></ul>

<p>Accusations of admin abuse, misconduct or bias should be considered carefully. They should <i>not</i> be blown out of proportion and used as the basis for the sort of polemic written above, apparently without regard to the truth. Clearly in hindsight Toddst1 could have been more willing to admit that his approach was not perfect. I think I&#39;ve commented enough on the other parties.  &#60;font color=&#34;006622&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:SheffieldSteel">S&#60;small&#62;HEFFIELD&#60;/small&#62;S&#60;small&#62;TEEL&#60;/small&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;&#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:SheffieldSteel">TALK</a>&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 14:17, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>And I state my claim. Todd did nothing <i>in May</i> regarding the anon. And this question started in May, when, however, he was keen to warn (actually I think he blocked) Maurice. But this question is making me yawn already and I promised not to post here again (unless I get misrepresented, like above). </dd>
<dd>By the way, I never accused him of admin abuse. You said that.

<dd>Thanks for providing some specific information. Neither yourself nor Maurice27 made it clear that your concerns were about events a month ago, and given that the original post was about recent events, I&#39;m sure you can understand how readers have responded.</dd>
<dd>As for whether you are accusing Toddst1 of admin abuse <i>per se</i>, or of some other form of misconduct or bias, or simply wish to make vague accusations, I&#39;ve expanded the section title to encompass what I think you meant by <i>this is when an admin starts to tread so low that you wonder what is the use of admins</i> and <i>he is an administrator and he is supposed to abide to some [ ... ] standards</i> et cetera.</dd>

<dd>I just think he made a poor job back then, but everybody can make mistakes, admins too (that is why I said that I guess it is ok what he did, and I think that suffices for my good faith assumption). In this June round, I have found him a bit too trigger happy with Maurice, while kinda loose with the anon. </dd>
<dd>But I do not wish to enter wikimisery, like when an administrator uses <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&#38;diff=296879402&#38;oldid=296878473|the" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AAdministrators%27_noticeboard%2FIncidents&#38;diff=296879402&#38;oldid=296878473|the">broad paint in his summary edits</a> (or treads low, as you wish) when referring to my otherwise I think civil comments (with one of those summary edits I have few doubts that a user like, say, Maurice would get blocked).

<dl>
<dd>About my accusations, I believe I have already explained them clearly here above one by one, but if any admin has still doubts about my accusations or the content of them, I will gladly provide as many explanations as desired.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>On the other hand, when Toddst1 opened this incident, he forgot to mention to you all that I <b>did</b> ask for help to administrators as early as <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive536#Posible_vandalism_at_Catalan_people_Article" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive536#Posible_vandalism_at_Catalan_people_Article">May 9</a> at the administrators noticeboard. As you may see in the link, he closed the case only 2 hours later, preventing other administrators to take a look and blocked me for 2 weeks.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>Since he was informed on <b>May 9</b> until he gave the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:81.44.100.87" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:81.44.100.87">first warning</a> to the anon on <b>June 15</b> (that&#39;s 2 days ago), <b>6 weeks have passed</b>. 6 weeks in which the anon has acted freely! Toddst1 hasn&#39;t done anything until I almost broke the 3RR 2 days ago. Instead than giving me (at the noticeboard) or us (at the talk-page) a pausible explanation of what to doas you (SheffieldSteel) <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Catalan_people#Semi-protection_isn.27t_an_option.2C_but_full_protection_is" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Catalan_people#Semi-protection_isn.27t_an_option.2C_but_full_protection_is">just did</a>, he just remained silent.</dd></dl>

<p>It was certainly clear to this reader that Todd&#39;s actions on this issue (i.e. since May) were being discussed, since diffs were given to that effect. So the two minor things you sought to clarify in the complaints are clarified. &#34;without regard for the truth&#34; my eye. Todd eventually says above re the most recent incident:</p>
<p><i>I perhaps should have used WP:EW instead of WP:3RR in my warning (now ammended</i>[sic]<i>).</i> </p>
<p>Yes, <i>perhaps</i>. If you wanted to give any impression that you were acting in good faith and had a clue what you&#39;re doing, <i>perhaps</i>. Or perhaps you should have left alone the editors who were using the talk page to come to a consensus, so that they could continue to do just that. </p>
<p>I hope Toddst is not in the habit of pointing at 18 month old sanctions when  labeling something a <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&#38;type=&#38;user=Toddst1&#38;page=User%3AMaurice27&#38;year=&#38;month=-1&#38;tagfilter=&#34;repeat" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&#38;type=&#38;user=Toddst1&#38;page=User%3AMaurice27&#38;year=&#38;month=-1&#38;tagfilter=&#34;repeat">offense&#34;</a> in a block summary.

<dd>Pbskidz61 pointed out on ,my talk page that this page is semiprotected so new accounts cannot post here. Seems like an odd way to do business, and it is unlikely that vandalizs here would long go unnoticed and would be dealt with efficiently. Is the semiprotection always there, and if so why? I suggested that Pbskidz61 could explain the odd redirects on his/her talk page as a stopgap. <a href="" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Edison">talk</a>) 17:29, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>I know I&#39;m coming a bit late to this and I&#39;m not sure if this comment will be noticed but I want to say that I think it&#39;s possible the SPI didn&#39;t get quite everything.  I am the one who turned <a href="" title="Peepee">Peepee</a> from a redirect into a dab page and I have it on my watchlist for that reason.  When I saw the vandalism I figured it was just everyday potty humor.  But for some reason I was curious and started looking around the user&#39;s contributions to see if there was more vandalism that needed to be reverted.  I didn&#39;t find any, but I did find that the puppetmaster was ScienceGolfFan, who, by coincidence, I happened to have crossed paths with earlier.  This user was originally named <a href="" title="User:Dbacvdeifdgthoimjskflan">User:Dbacvdeifdgthoimjskflan</a>, which is &#34;Davidtomsfan&#34; interlaced with an alphabetic sequence of letters.  Remembering this reminded me of <a href="" title="user:Ftuecwkasphaictk">user:Ftuecwkasphaictk</a>, which is <a href="" title="User:Tewapack">User:Tewapack</a> interlaced with &#34;fuck&#34; and &#34;shit&#34; in much the same way.  I had stumbled upon this other user sometime earlier but noticed that he was already blocked and thought nothing of it, and did not tell Tewapack about this likely &#34;attack&#34; account.  I&#39;m bringing this up now because I think that it&#39;s possible that <a href="" title="User:Ftuecwkasphaictk">User:Ftuecwkasphaictk</a> is yet another sockpuppet of <a href="" title="User:ScienceGolfFanatic">User:ScienceGolfFanatic</a>, even though it didn&#39;t turn up on the sockpuppet investigation.  I have to assume that it didnt turn up because it might be using a different IP address.  Even though this user is already blocked, I think it&#39;s possible  that there are more users yet unnoticed who are using the IP of Ftuecwkasphaictk but not of ScienceGolfFan (if, indeed, they are different IPs.) Im not familiar with SPI, so it&#39;s possible that I am wrong about the IPs and it didnt turn up on the list because blocked users never do.     Again, Ftuecwkasphaictk is already blocked, but there may be more sockpuppets and I just want to bring this to attention if it isnt already too late.   <i>&#60;B&#62;<a href="" title="User:Soap">Soap</a>&#60;/B&#62;</i> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Soap">Talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62;/&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Soap">Contributions</a>&#60;/sub&#62; 16:35, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Warren_Kinsella_redux">Warren Kinsella redux</span></h2>

<p><a href="" title="Warren Kinsella">Warren Kinsella</a>, the subject of every Canadian&#39;s favourite nexus of contentious Wikipedia editwarring, has now sent me a private e-mail accusing me of libel and requesting my name and address so he can &#34;pursue this matter legally&#34;.</p>
<p>[ Private Email redacted   -  please don&#39;t post private email ]</p>
<p>I want to stress the following points:
</p>
<ol>
<li>At no time did I ever express any form of personal opinion about the subject whatsoever; my <i>very</i> limited involvement with the article has revolved entirely around enforcing <a href="" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> rules. I have attempted to communicate on the related talk pages — the article and the user talk pages of the anonymous IPs that he was using — that Kinsella was free to discuss his concerns with the article content on the article&#39;s talk page for resolution; however, this e-mail is the first response of any kind that I&#39;ve ever received from him.</li>
<li>The current version of the article has previously been listed here for review and been found to be consistent with <a href="" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> on more than one occasion. I feel the need to repeat that I have no &#34;preferred&#34; version of the article, and no interest in the subject whatsoever beyond my role as an administrator in ensuring that policy is followed. Accordingly, I have absolutely no objection to content being removed from the article by a neutral party if it&#39;s found to be a BLP violation — and, in fact, I&#39;d be perfectly happy to see the article deleted outright, given that it&#39;s turning into more trouble than it&#39;s worth. But if Kinsella has concerns with the article&#39;s content, he needs to follow the proper procedures for resolving it, not vandalism coupled with legal threats.</li></ol>

<p>So again, I need to ask: firstly, can somebody review whether or not the standing version of the article is consistent with BLP? And secondly, what, if anything, should I do about the legal threat apart from the obvious &#34;don&#39;t answer his e-mail&#34;? <a href="" title="User:Bearcat">Bearcat</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Bearcat">talk</a>) 07:39, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Don&#39;t answer is really the best thing to do in this situation.

<dd>I agree with ironholds; Never forward any personal information trough e-mails. While the e-mail does indeed seem to belong to her that does not in any way oblige you to submit personal information; this e-mail is in no jurisdiction a legal instrument to demand information. Hence, i would strongly advice against it. </dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Similary, does the e-mail refer to a wikipedia account? Par <a href="" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a> issuing legal threats, both on and of Wikipedia, is strictly forbidden. If there is a user account behind this mail it should be indefinitely blocked for violating that guideline. Also, par wikipedia guidelines the subject of an article can contact info-en-q@wikipedia.org at any time to inquire about libel issues; there is no need whatsoever to contact a single editor.  Similary, threats should be handled by the wikipedia foundation lawyer. If the e-mail refers to a user its probally best to indef it with a notice towards the <a href="" title="WP:NLT">WP:NLT</a> page. If not, i should advice you to ignore it altogether. <a href="" title="User:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;191970&#34;&#62;<b>Excirial</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; (<a href="" title="User talk:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contact me&#60;/font&#62;</a>,<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 11:13, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>User Supreme Deliciousness had, earlier today, deleted my own sourced information, based on Omar Sharif&#39;s own autobigraphy, The Eternal Male, and replaced it with unreliable websites and an obscure book without proper referencing.  SD used that obscure book to argue that Omar Sharif &#34;may have been born in Greece&#34;.  In the original source that SD had deleted, The Eternal Male, on page 39, Omar Sharif states that he was born in Alexandria, Egypt.  </dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I do not have to photocopy the pages of the book for SD&#39;s viewing.  The Amazon link shows the book&#39;s proper referencing information including title, authors, ISBN, etc.  It is up to SD to purchase the book and read it.  </dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>

<dd>SD used the same reference, the obscure book, to destroy also earlier today another article I had spent hours building, <a href="" title="Stephan Rosti">Stephan Rosti</a>, to prove that he was Hungarian.  Previously, SD had used IMDB to prove that <a href="" title="Stephan Rosti">Stephan Rosti</a> was Italian.! SD has done the same with the <a href="" title="Soad Hosny">Soad Hosny</a> article.  SD is clearly going around Wikipedia making changes against everyone Egyptian.  </dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Good thing you&#39;re not an admin with an attitude like that. Jakezing had been goading him repeatedly, and Max is a foreign language speaker - from my experience (and after looking at the situation as a whole, which I&#39;m forced to assume you haven&#39;t done) he meant simply &#34;what is your problem with me&#34; based on Jakezing repeatedly pestering and harassing him. That isn&#39;t &#34;begging for an insult&#34; - Jakezing is the one goading people, not Max. <a href="" title="User:Ironholds">Ironholds</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ironholds">talk</a>) 14:57, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it is a good thing I&#39;m not an admin, as I would probably hate the job. I am by no means apologizing for Jakezing. His comments about other users &#34;annoying&#34; him are part of what led to his previous block. And in any language, asking &#34;Why don&#39;t you like me?&#34; or &#34;What is your problem with me?&#34; is a leading question that&#39;s unlikely to result in a satisfactory answer. Jakezing should have responded with a list of some factual issues. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs">carrots</a> 15:27, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>Shell Kinney and I both independently denied his request for unblock based on the promise that he would avoid all talk pages.  Baseball_Bugs, thanks for that; note, though, that&#39;s it&#39;s really just one indef block; the second was just done to include a block summary for the first.  Jakezing promised several times early this year that he could change if given the chance.  I don&#39;t see much evidence that he is even better than he was.  <a href="" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice">&#60;span style=&#34;color:orange&#34;&#62;<b>juice</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 15:11, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id=".26quot.3BUnder_review_by_Wikipedia.26quot.3B.3F">&#34;Under review by Wikipedia&#34;?</span></h2>

<p>Yesterday, <a href="" title="User:Debora999">User:Debora999</a> removed   from <a href="" title="David Ferguson (impresario)">David Ferguson (impresario)</a>, with no edit summary and no attempts to fix the issues. I   (with a few others that I thought the article needed as well) and left the standard   message  . In response (among other replies)  :&#60;blockquote&#62;Hmmm... Ms. Smith, it seems there is only one place that a citation is needed. I think I can take care of that. What is the problem here? I&#39;ve reviewed your activities here and it seems like you must have a personal issue with this individual. Are you aware that you&#39;re under review by Wikipedia for your activities? They&#39;ve flagged your talk page. I&#39;m pretty sure they suspect that you know this person and have a conflict of interest... --<a href="" title="User:Debora999">deb</a> (<a href="#Top" title="User talk:Debora999">talk</a>) 19:45, 16 June 2009 (UTC)&#60;/blockquote&#62;Okay, keeping in mind that I haven&#39;t touched that article in over four months (due to getting fed up with <a href="" title="WP:SPA">SPA</a> editors), that most of that article&#39;s citations are primary sources and/or sourced solely to the subject&#39;s own website, that <a href="" title="User:Debora999">Debora999</a> describes herself as &#34; &#34; and that she &#38; I have never previously interacted, I&#39;m ignoring most of that rant. But the last part? I have to think that it would be a good idea for someone—<i>not me</i>—to drop her a line about <a href="" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>, at a minimum.</p>
<p>And while I shouldn&#39;t have to mention it, I&#39;m happy to state for the record that I don&#39;t know Ferguson; so far as I know, I don&#39;t know anyone who knows Ferguson; and I&#39;ve never had any dealings (professional or otherwise) with Ferguson himself or with any of his businesses or organizations. &#60;span style=&#39;font:bold 1.2em &#34;Apple Garamond&#34;,&#34;Adobe Garamond Pro&#34;,Garamond,serif;color:#369;&#39;&#62;<a href="" title="User:DoriSmith">Dori</a> ❦ (<a href="" title="User talk:DoriSmith">Talk</a> ❖ <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/DoriSmith">Contribs</a> ❖ <a href="" title="WP:Editor review/DoriSmith">Review</a>) ❦&#60;/span&#62; 22:09, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<p>To avoid future errors with the template  , it could be helpful to alter the text from &#34;is currently on editor review&#34; to perhaps &#34; has asked for an editor review&#34; or &#34;has requested an editor review&#34;.&#60;div style=&#34;color:darkgreen;&#34;&#62; ~~ <a href="" title="User:Phoe">&#60;span style=&#34;color:darkgreen;&#34;&#62;Phoe&#60;/span&#62;</a> &#60;sub&#62; <a href="" title="User talk:Phoe">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:sans-serif;color:darkgreen;&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a> &#60;/sub&#62; ~~ 22:54, 16 June 2009 (UTC) &#60;/div&#62;  </p>
<p>You&#39;re right, I did misunderstand &#34;editor review&#34; and I am a newbie.  But why is this person so concerned with my editing on that particular page?  I apologize if it sounded like a rant, but does someone follow you and revert your changes as well, especially when it was so insignificant to you personally?  It&#39;s frustrating.  Anyone from Wikipedia can look at my activities and see that I don&#39;t know what the heck I&#39;m doing...  sorry Ms. Smith, I forgot a signature, probably more as well.  As for that &#34;rant&#34; I tried to delete it before it posted but hit the wrong button and saved it, as the record shows, and the time stamp, I immediately re-edited to remove it--it was simply not meant to be left behind.  But, honestly...  what IS the problem with that page?  I honestly don&#39;t get it...  I don&#39;t even understand why everyone is always arguing here.  By the way, I did fix the citation problem on the page, so I&#39;m then allowed to remove that template right?  I&#39;m not trying to pick any fights so no need to go to the mattresses...  ok--I&#39;m asking for advice here.  Oh yeah, Ms. Smith, when I commented about what I thought was a flag on your talk page, I thought I was doing you a favor. Is that why you left me that message on my talk page that stated that I was &#34;under investigation&#34; by Wikipedia?  You forgot to mention it was because you started this...  I guess they&#39;ll let me know if I&#39;m going to get spanked.  How does anyone learn this stuff if there&#39;s always someone to smack us down for learning it?  This is not an ownership situation is it?  Are you in the article or a subject of it?  If so, I&#39;m sorry for picking on your page, I&#39;m not trying to do anything malicious.<a href="" title="User:Debora999">deb</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Debora999">talk</a>) 01:46, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The way most of us learn it is by using what we learned about research in high school and college, combining it with what we learned about working cooperatively with others from our parents and our employers, and supplementing that prior knowledge by reading Wikipedia&#39;s rules.  Sometimes we mess up, and someone corrects us- then we go read the rule (most people make a habit of linking to them), learn it, and do better next time.  Sometimes we get into real disagreements with other people, and we have to just go do something else until we are less angry.  The first few months, we make a lot of mistakes, and learn a lot.  Even when we&#39;ve been around for a long time, we still mess up, get corrected, and get into disagreements.  You could probably read the talk pages and talk archives of anyone in this conversation and see lots of examples of mistakes, corrections, disagreements, apologies, negotiations, and compromises.  But writing the encyclopedia is something that anyone with good reading, writing, and interpersonal skills can learn to do well. -<a href="" title="User:FisherQueen">FisherQueen</a>&#60;span style=&#34;font-size: smaller;&#34;&#62; (<a href="" title="User talk:FisherQueen">talk</a> · <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/FisherQueen">contribs</a>)&#60;/span&#62; 02:02, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>About the problem with the article, as the template indicates, there are multiple issues with the article. You can follow the links given in it to find out more about the problems and how to solve them. Since this has already been disputed, I suggest you discuss on the article&#39;s talk page whether or not to remove the templates (after fixing the problems of course) and see what others think. As for the arguments here, that&#39;s kind of traditional :D Everyone here likes contributing to Wikipedia and are kind of attached to it so you get heated discussions and debates... but once we develop consensus on what to do, we can move on. It&#39;s not like we bear a grudge and keep going on about it. After the matter is resolved,learn from it and forget the rest. <a href="" title="User:Chamal_N"><b>&#60;font color=&#34;#000080&#34;&#62;C&#60;/font&#62;h&#60;font color=&#34;#0000FF&#34;&#62;a&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#4169E1&#34;&#62;m&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#1E90FF&#34;&#62;a&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#87CEEB&#34;&#62;l&#60;/font&#62;</b></a> <a href="" title="User talk:Chamal_N">&#60;sup&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 02:12, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>The sum total of what I&#39;ve written on your talk page is   and  . That&#39;s it. If you have an issue with the standard templates, then that&#39;s <i>your</i> issue with the standard templates.</li>
<li>I didn&#39;t say anything about you having left off a signature, because I don&#39;t care.</li>
<li>I <i>strongly</i> object to your saying that I &#34;follow you and revert your changes.&#34; That&#39;s calling <a href="" title="WP:Wikihounding">WP:Wikihounding</a>, and I <b>have not done that</b>. I objected to <i>one</i> change you made, and when I edited the page I modified a few things (not just a reversion). That&#39;s it. An apology would be nice.</li>
<li>The problem with the <a href="" title="David Ferguson (impresario)">David Ferguson (impresario)</a> article is just what I said above: too many <a href="" title="WP:SPA">SPA</a> editors, and too few good citations. If you took out all the primary sources and the refs that link to Ferguson&#39;s own web site, then we might have a shot at a decent article. But try to do that and &#34;Wham!&#34; the flying <a href="" title="WP:SPA">SPA</a> monkeys swoop in. Have you read through all the talk page archives?</li>

<p>I&#39;m concerned that this user is engaged in a pattern of trolling and petty harassment. Please review his or her talkpage and contributions. At a minimum, he or she has started his editing career very much off on the wrong foot; very possibly, much worse. I&#39;d appreciate someone else taking a look and implementing whatever action he or she deems appropriate, whether it&#39;s a stern warning or an indefinite block. (In my limited inquiries, I have not found any evidence of socking, however.)

<dd>Long story short, from my point of view. I made a few edits to the reference desk, somebody mentioned suicide, I posted to this board, by post was removed with the summary WP:DENY, I questioned this, Jehochman and I got into a bit of a debate about the way I was spoken to (which we resolved, amicably I believe), Ryulong also reverted me, I had the same discussion with him, he was IMO rude and dismissive, I raised this to him also, he continued to be dismissive and refused to answer, we had a bit of a debate, he was rude to me a bit, I was rude to him a bit, Frank started reverting my comments, I posted to Ryulong suggesting we never contact each other again, he then contacted me again in a rude manner, I responded in a rude manner, Frank reverted me, I asked Frank to review Ryulong&#39;s comments as well as mine, Frank told me that Ryulong was more experience than me. Then I got the note from Brad. <a href="#39.3Bs_Laugh" title="User:Frank Bruno&amp;amp;">Frank Bruno&#38;#39;s Laugh</a> (<a href="#39.3Bs_Laugh" title="User talk:Frank Bruno&amp;amp;">talk</a>) 23:37, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<li>(ecx2 with above) I had noticed FBL&#39;s behavior earlier, and held off on blocking for the time. Given the continued baiting, harassment, and refusal to disengage in the conflict, I have blocked indefinitely. Review is welcomed, and should consensus form against the block (or its being lessened), I need not be consulted first. <i>÷<a href="" title="user:seresin">seresin</a></i> 23:43, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>My two cents, which took about a dime&#39;s worth of time to compose: I have followed this little bit of drama for a few days.

<dd>Is that supposed to be a riddle or a rhetorical question?  I don&#39;t know, not being able to follow every bit of drama this place serves up.  Other than the two accounts I blocked, there are no other identifiable current or recent sockpuppets.  Are you asking for a recheck so you can use a more precise block template?  I&#39;m not sure there is much value in that. <a href="" title="User talk:Thatcher">Thatcher</a> 14:44, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I&#39;m an employee of Dotster, Inc. and I&#39;d like to bring to your attention the user RegistrarHistorian.  This user&#39;s <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RegistrarHistorian" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/RegistrarHistorian">edits and contributions</a>to various Domain Registrar sites has been intentionally negatively biased against Dotster. This user originally created a Dotster Wiki page that has since been deleted, and I&#39;m not aware of what the content was, but apparently it was deserving of deletion.  Since that time, the user has continued to make negatively biased or false edits about Dotster.  Examples include <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Go_Daddy&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=289834251" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Go_Daddy&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=289834251">an unnecessary comparison of GoDaddy and Dotster</a> on the Godaddy page that is factually inaccurate (this user has since included a graph to accompany the statement, an <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Network_Solutions&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=290662079" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Network_Solutions&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=290662079">edit on the Network Solutions page</a> that, while truthful, does not add to that page, and most recently changed the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_domain_name_registrars&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296697884" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_domain_name_registrars&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296697884">List of Domain Name Registrars</a> page to move Dotster from its proper spot to the bottom of the list with (service suspended).  As for that last part, I don&#39;t even know what exactly that means, but it&#39;s certainly not true as we&#39;re still operating and not suspended.</p>
<p>As a Dotster employee I don&#39;t want to be editing these pages and have a conflict of interest, but it appears that this user is specifically targeting Dotster with negative information.  I started a discussion on the GoDaddy talk page suggesting that the page be modified to remove the Dotster comparison completely, but I think unless the user is dealt with the issue won&#39;t be resolved.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="User:IvoShandor_:_A_short_rest_may_be_required">User:IvoShandor : A short rest may be required</span></h2>

<p>This was brought to our attention in <a href="" title="WP:WQA">WP:WQA</a>.  I will give some background:</p>

<ul>
<li>An editor tagged <a href="" title="Sidelight">an article that IvoShandor had created</a> for CSD.  </li>
<li>Ivo <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sidelight&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296914592" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sidelight&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296914592">removed the tag</a> with the edit summary &#34;this is total bullshit, take it to AFD&#34;.  </li>
<li>Ivo then <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:IvoShandor&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296915403" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:IvoShandor&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296915403">removed all related notifications from his page</a> with the edit summary &#34;rmv trolling nonsense from asshole&#34; (which is a painful place to keep nonsense).</li>
<li><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fire_55&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296915213" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fire_55&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296915213">This edit</a> where he calls another editor a &#34;condescending twit&#34;, and then today <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fire_55&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=296915213" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Fire_55&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=296915213">this entire post</a> with the summary &#34;fuck you dick&#34;.</li></ul>
<p>These are worth a series of escalating warnings (and I have given him a level 4).  However, what concerns me is his reply <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiquette_alerts&#38;diff=296927774&#38;oldid=296922500" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiquette_alerts&#38;diff=296927774&#38;oldid=296922500">when a WQA entry was filed</a>: <i>&#34;Did I go a little overboard with the incivility? You bet. And honestly, if my vulgar language and uncivil behavior discourages destructive editors like yourself, then it is by far worth any consequences&#34;</i>.  Indeed, his <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bwilkins&#38;diff=cur" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Bwilkins&#38;diff=cur">posting on my talkpage after the warning</a> a second ago also confirms he will drive off other editors.
When an editors purpose of incivility is to dicourage participation, it is becoming disruptive to the project.  As such, a little rest would not be punitive, it would be preventative of disruption and other attempts to dissuade editing.

<dd><b>Comment</b> To play devil&#39;s advocate here, an even better way to &#34;drive off editors from the project&#34; is to tag things with spurious CSDs and the like. We already have far too many non-contributing wikilawyers who because they find some legalese excuse as to why they <i>can</i> delete something, see it as an opportunity <i>to</i> delete something. Although I&#39;m sure <a href="" title="User:IvoShandor">User:IvoShandor</a> has a thick enough skin to not be bothered by this, we do repeatedly see situations where new editors see their first works <a href="" title="WP:BITE">bitten</a> like this and then disappear forever (and a little guidance to them instead might have solved everything).</dd>
<dd>I can&#39;t excuse <a href="" title="User:IvoShandor">User:IvoShandor</a>&#39;s lack of civility. That&#39;s a requirement here, we&#39;re expected to stick with it despite provocations and on the whole the project works better with that than without it. However I can certainly understand his frustrations and would hate to see this turn into a wikitarring where the CSD-tagging editor is exonerated as blameless, just because they have the talent to remain polite whilst they&#39;re being condescending. <a href="" title="User:Andy Dingley">Andy Dingley</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Andy Dingley">talk</a>) 10:52, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I&#39;d also question why this is on AN/I and is thus presumedly considered to be a risk of damage to the project, rather than an etiquette issue (perhaps worthy of admonishment, but not risking the technical content in the way that vandalism and the like does). <a href="" title="User:Andy Dingley">Andy Dingley</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Andy Dingley">talk</a>) 10:52, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>edit conflict. ;Persomally I don&#39;t think a block would be anything but punative. This is an experianced user that just needs to take a step back and see he is going down the wrong road with his emotions. Is there any other occasions where the same attitude is displayed? That would warrent this charge of driving away editors? This looks like an isolated emotional flare up to me and would be better discussed back at <a href="" title="WP:WQA">WP:WQA</a> (<a href="" title="User:Off2riorob">Off2riorob</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Off2riorob">talk</a>) 10:54, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The previous occasion was a year and a half ago. Although it was for what looks like exactly the same attitude. (<a href="" title="User:Off2riorob">Off2riorob</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Off2riorob">talk</a>) 10:59, 17 June 2009 (UTC))</dd>
<dd>I tried to respond, but lost it in an EC I don&#39;t want to participate in this escalation, because it is essentially a moot point. A block would only be punitive, but if you feel like it will help then go ahead. I really feel like if this is a pattern for the editor I lashed out at then that editor shouldn&#39;t be around. Obviously I&#39;m not going to drive anyone away with a few words behind a computer (which while harsh and mean) were simply words. If I made anyone sad or upset then I am sorry. I&#39;ve never tried to drive anyone away (and don&#39;t think that any serious person would think that this editor is going to be driven away - if they are, thicker skin may be warranted), and like most of us have put up with my fair share of crap around here, not that I haven&#39;t dished some out too, but honestly I just call it how I see it. I still think the speedy tag was an uncool move (is it ok to say uncool in place d*ck), and yes I snapped off a little, but the self-righteous posturing of some people around here is really just too much sometimes. --<a href="" title="User:IvoShandor">IvoShandor</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:IvoShandor">talk</a>) 11:01, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>We&#39;re trying to maintain a collegial atmosphere, here, Ivo.  Politeness really does help, really.  To some extent, yes, editors need to have the ability to brush off harsh words sent their way.  The examples linked above, though, seem to go beyond what one should expect to have directed toward oneself in what is supposed to be a collaborative project.  We&#39;re all working together here.  <a href="" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> &#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;&#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a>&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 12:57, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b> Warn both </b> I would say a block is a bit to much for this, on either side. The editor that placed the tag was clearly in error placing it, and from past experience i can tell that Ivo is not the only person who becomes... Annoyed with a wrong tag. That being said i do not agree with the exaggerated response, and i strongly disapprove of the general lack of understanding that this can indeed drive (Especially new) editors away. </dd>
<dd>Still, blocks should be a last resort. I would say that the tagger should get a warning for incorrect tags, and Ivo should get a warning about incivility - and both should stop bickering over this issue. Personally i believe that should solve it; no need to force a block here. <a href="" title="User:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;191970&#34;&#62;<b>Excirial</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; (<a href="" title="User talk:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contact me&#60;/font&#62;</a>,<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 11:38, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I suppose it would be escalating the situation to nominate the article for deletion?

<dd>Please do - It wouldn&#39;t be at all helpful, but I can&#39;t wait to read your nomination for it. How can you <i>possibly</i> think that would be a useful way to act? Why are you even suggesting it? Your worthy comment, &#34;We&#39;re all working together here.&#34; cannot be reconciled with such an action if you have the remotest appreciation of good faith. It&#39;s clearly necessary to remind you that &#34;good faith&#34; applies to <i>other people too</i>, not just your own lofty judgement, and that includes Ivo. I know his crime is terrible, and that one day we&#39;ll have eradicated the dread scourge of people creating articles here, but in the meantime how about having at least a shred of appreciation for those people who carry on the core business of the encyclopedia: content. A little reminder: articles are created because someone once considered that their content was worth recording. This is not a coconut-shy where one group writes content just so that another group can bask in the pleasure of demonstrating their vast understanding of almighty <b><i>P</i></b><i>olicy</i> and finding a way to delete it. <a href="" title="User:Andy Dingley">Andy Dingley</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Andy Dingley">talk</a>) 13:32, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Gosh, maybe that&#39;s why I checked here first, Andy.  All I meant was that had I encountered this article separately from this discussion, I likely would have sent it to AfD myself, or even speedily redirected it, per policy.  (Unless perhaps if it was brand new (&#60; 1 day old) or had numerous incoming links.)  I admittedly should have checked the creation date before suggesting that an AfD may be in order.  <a href="" title="User:LtPowers">Powers</a> &#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;&#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:LtPowers">T</a>&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 14:28, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li>Calling somebody an &#34;asshole&#34; is not just incivility, it is a personal attack designed to drive the other editor away. Ivo, will you undertake not to repeat that?

<li><i>07:27, 26 February 2007 (edit) (undo)</i>. In other words more then two years ago. This is not even relevant anymore - if you are going to complain about my CSD tagging, are you going to argue that my first month of tags was way over the top, even though that happened 1.5 years ago? If this behavior happened on regular basis i would agree with that diff, but unless i see something more recent i fail to see the merit of this. Snapping once every 2 years? Regrettable but tolerable i would say. <a href="" title="User:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;191970&#34;&#62;<b>Excirial</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; (<a href="" title="User talk:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contact me&#60;/font&#62;</a>,<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 13:52, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Er, that was simply the extreme case (and it was extreme). As I mentioned, it&#39;s happened quite a number of times. We can see evidence of that here. When a case this extreme exists, I don&#39;t think it unreasonable to point towards it in the face of similar conduct 2 years later. It&#39;s not irrelevant at all in that light. &#38;mdash;&#60;strong&#62;<a href="" title="User:Anonymous Dissident">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:DarkRed&#34;&#62;Anonymous Dissident&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/strong&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Anonymous Dissident">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&#34;&#62;Talk&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 13:59, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All the evidence i see so far is 1) Evidence over two years old. 2) Evidence generated within a few hour timespan. In fact i think we can count this as two counts of uncivil behavior within a two year timespan. Sure, there were more edits but in case someone gets fired up that happends; it rarely stays to a single edit. Also, do we really need to make a soapbox out of this and start trowing around blocks for a single incident? I completely agree we should keep it friendly around here, but we should not dramatize and scream block as soon as someone steps over the line once. Screaming block, after all, does not really help to establish a friendly atmosphere. :) <a href="" title="User:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;191970&#34;&#62;<b>Excirial</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; (<a href="" title="User talk:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contact me&#60;/font&#62;</a>,<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 14:20, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

In April and May 2008, <a href="" title="User:Fish and karate">User:Fish and karate</a> conducted a mediation which resulted in a version that did a lot to remove the POV and COI elements of the article.  The article has remained stable until April 1, 2009, when the following IP addresses started to make edits and leave messages on the talk page that have details that only Dane Rauschenberg could know:
</p>
<div style="page-break-inside: avoid;">

<p>The location data are consistent with the travels that Mr. Rauschenberg discusses on his blog.</p>
<p>The problem is that instead of confining the article to past verifiable events, which was mostly resolved by the mediation, these IP editors seek to &#34;plug&#34; Mr. Rauschenberg&#39;s new book and an upcoming race that he is organizing in August 2009.  Ordinarily, including a new book by the subject of an article would be appropriate for inclusion, but this book is not listed on amazon.com, and the publishing house has only produced two titles, this being one of them.  There are no reviews of the book in the mainstream media, and it has all of the trappings of a <a href="" title="vanity press">vanity press</a> situation where Mr. Rauschenberg is the main vendor of his book inventory. (He sells it on his website and <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dane_Rauschenberg&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296501797" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Dane_Rauschenberg&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296501797">sells books at marathon expos.</a>)</p>

<dd><a href="" title="User:Racepacket">User:Racepacket</a> has been involved in a multi-year war relating to the article for <a href="" title="Dane Rauschenberg">Dane Rauschenberg</a>. I don&#39;t know who he is and have no opinion for or against the article&#39;s subject, but I saw the article at AfD, voted to keep, and then tried to sort through two warring pro- and anti-Rauschenberg factions that have been involved in the article. I have been through the article ensuring that all material is backed by reliable and verifiable sources, including articles about Rauschenberg and his 52-marathon effort from such sources as <i><a href="" title="The Washington Post">The Washington Post</a></i> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/04/AR2006010400627.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/04/AR2006010400627.html">here</a>, <i><a href="" title="Sports Illustrated">Sports Illustrated</a></i> <a class="externallink" href="http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1106726/index.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1106726/index.htm">here</a>, the <i><a href="" title="Pittsburgh Post-Gazette">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette</a></i> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06364/750070-140.stm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06364/750070-140.stm">here</a> and on <a href="" title="National Public Radio">National Public Radio</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6139116" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6139116">here</a>, all of which published reports on Rauschenberg, before, during and after his year-long effort.

Racepacket and his sockpuppets have made several allegations that Rauschenberg will physically assault him and appears to have some sort of personal connection with and grudge against Rauschenberg that he perpetuates using sockpuppets. A very lengthy block or ban of Racepacket will at least deal with half of the problem. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 17:25, 17 June 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Obivously, I disagree with the above.  There is a big difference between removing COI, unverifiable self-serving content and seeking to delete an entire article.  The question here is what to do about a series of IP editors that know offhand whether Rauschenberg was selling books at the San Diego Marathon expo and other details about his life.  Those editors do not want to live with the results of a mediation and do not want an objective verifiable article. In any event, there is no need for incivility. <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/66.173.140.100">66.173.140.100</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:66.173.140.100">talk</a>) 21:20, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>I wish that there was some credibility in the claim of being a crusading COI fighter, but the sad fact is that the whole Racepacket family of sockpuppets has been devoted to pushing the POV that Rauschenberg is not notable (despite consensus at AfD even with extensive votestacking) and claims that sources are not reliable (despite clear evidence that the articles are all about him and written independently in major national publications). From your collective descriptions about the article&#39;s subject, it is clear that you know and have some sort of contact with him and that this <a href="" title="WP:COI">conflict of interest</a> has led you to try to get even with him somehow through this article through a whole range of sockpuppets. Years ago I opened a sockpuppet report which resulted in eight blocks from all the COI factions, both pro- and anti-Rauschenburg. Racepacket has been caught multiple times using sockpuppets with and without usernames, and this is unfortunately continuing despite multiple blocks. It&#39;s hard to accept that someone who is so devoted to defaming an individual and abusing Wikipedia policy could claim that other people are being &#34;uncivil&#34;. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 00:57, 18 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>


<ul>
<li>Because Racepacket has a prior 1 week block for sockpupperty, and has clearly been editing while logged out to try and avoid scrutiny to his edits, <b>blocked</b> for 10 days.</li>
<li>Racepacket is further <b>banned</b> from making any edits to   for 3 months, under any user name or IP, to be enforced by a one month block and a reset of the 3 month ban timer should he violate the ban. He may make suggestions on the talk page. </li>

<p> 
Administrator Toddst1, I believe blocked me in bad faith.  I would like to also point out that he is encouraging user Wuhwuzdat by giving him more privleges aimed at blocking users.  The article I have been attempting to correct has glaring errors, and erroneous information that directly conflicts the facts in the NTSB report, and quotes copyrighted material from a newspaper article, that was written from the point of view of an unverified witness (WP:POV).  The cemetery listed on the article does not exist under the name that is published, and is in a different city that published.  The article lists attendees at the funeral that could only be verified by referencing the guest register from the funeral, or getting a notarized statement from someone who attended the service.  The only record of attendees is not verified, and comes from copyrighted newspaper and magazine articles.</p>
<p>Admin Toddst1 shows  the issue of user Wuhwuzdat using profanity, the &#34;F&#34; word, two different times as resolved.  This administrator is friendly with this user, which in my opinon makes him unable to be objective, and is a bit of a conflict of interest in this case. The administrators have only joked with this user about it, (with the exception of one who just said &#34;don&#39;t do it again&#34; and have not seriously addressed the issue. Please, someone do something about this.<a href="" title="User:Dfwaviator">Dfwaviator</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dfwaviator">talk</a>) 01:42, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>No, I don&#39;t want it removed. I thought I was cleaning up the article by removing a citation needed box. He added it back and I am fine with the edit. I have a problem with two things. First is the bullying and abuse of reporting practices. When I make an edit it is reverted by Storm Rider, and I issue a warning template the warnings are removed and Storm Rider reports me for abusing the reporting process or for reverting edits if I attempt to change them back. I don&#39;t understand why Storm Rider is not subject to the same rules I am. Or why I am unable to report him.  Second, his strong COI and neutrality issues. He has taken ownership of the article and has threatened or been uncivil to anyone with a challenging perspective. It&#39;s nothing short of harassment. --<a href="" title="User:DoyleCB">DoyleCB</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DoyleCB">talk</a>) 05:30, 18 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

He seems to be editing wikipedia to make my user name illegal, but, as a simple search on google will show, mathsci is used everywhere (e.g. for mathematical forums, mathematics departments, journals, etc).  <a href="" title="User:Mathsci">Mathsci</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mathsci">talk</a>) 19:03, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>For the record, I reject these accusations, which are significantly inaccurate in many ways and largely unsupported.  </dd>
<dd>I will address the principal complaint first.  User:MathSci alleges that I have &#34;edited <a href="" title="Mathsci">Mathsci</a> and <a href="" title="Mathematical Reviews">Mathematical Reviews</a> to include faulty information&#34;.  This is one of the most serious accusations that could be levelled against a contributor and it is quite untrue.  The database (as opposed to its web interface) is called MathSci, and has been since 1999 at least: its name MathSci is a trademark of the <a href="" title="American Mathematical Society">American Mathematical Society</a>.  It is available today under that name as an online service and a CD-ROM.  I provided sources for all this <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mathsci&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296703410" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mathsci&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296703410">here</a> <i>before making any article changes</i>, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mathsci&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296791791" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mathsci&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296791791">here</a>, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_Reviews&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296792472" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Mathematical_Reviews&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296792472">here</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mathematical_Reviews&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296808444" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mathematical_Reviews&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296808444">here</a> and <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mathematical_Reviews&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296811219" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mathematical_Reviews&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=296811219">here</a>.

<dd>Regardless of other matters, that edit is correct;  mathSci is a database produced by the AMs, available not only on CDs but thru the DIALOG service <a class="externallink" href="http://library.dialog.com/bluesheets/html/bl0239.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://library.dialog.com/bluesheets/html/bl0239.html"><a class="externallink" href="http://library.dialog.com/bluesheets/html/bl0239.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://library.dialog.com/bluesheets/html/bl0239.html">http://library.dialog.com/bluesheets/html/bl0239.html</a></a> ,  and this name is much more widely known and has been for many years than the US high school.   I think the disam p. is needed, but if it is used for any one thing, it should redirect to the Web Search service., not the school. If it is used for other specific organizations or sites as well, then a more elaborate disam p. is needed. I do not consider that edit harassment, and changing back to the Redirect was in my opinion wrong.   Needless to say, there is no connection and User:Mathsci is not in the least a promotional username--it is a very widely used phrase. One can trademark even such a phrase when used in a particular context, as here.  <b><a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> (<a href="" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a>) 06:45, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The edit was inaccurate, because the database refers to two distinct publications as is clearly stated on the AMS website (MR and CMP). As DGG is a professional scientific librarian, he will know that mathematicians use the terms MathSciNet, mathscinet and Mathscinet in real life, not mathsci, Mathsci or MathSci. I certainly used the multidisc set in the early 90&#39;s in the Scientific Periodicals Library in Cambridge before the online catalogue became available.  By adding &#34;id= &#34; [i.e. &#60;nowiki&#62; id= &#60;/nowiki&#62;] to the citation template, editors on WP can make a direct link to a mathscinet review in articles related to mathematics (this example is from <a href="" title="Michael Atiyah">Michael Atiyah</a>), but not to the master database. <a href="" title="User:Mathsci">Mathsci</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mathsci">talk</a>) 09:09, 18 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="ARBMAC_cluebat_needed">ARBMAC cluebat needed</span></h2>

<p>There&#39;s been a renewed bout of Greek-Albanian national edit-warring recently, which needs some treatment under <a href="" title="WP:ARBMAC">WP:ARBMAC</a> (the original). The main articles affected are currently  ,  , as well as several location articles such as  . The main participants are:

<p>My impression is that the main troublemakers are I Pakapshem and Sarandioti on the one side and Factuarius on the other: the aggressive edit-warring comes mostly from the two new Albanian users, while a lot of the tendentious editing that has been spurring the conflict has been the responsibility of Factuarius, with Balkanian`s word and the other Greek editors showing a somewhat more constructive approach. The whole situation needs ample use of the discretionary sanctions rule by somebody with a good solid cluebat. <a href="" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">☼</a> 20:11, 16 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;d like to point out that the disruption on location articles began recently, when Sarandioti burst on the scene and I Pakapshem soon after.  These articles were more or less stable prior to that.  These appear to be SPAs whose sole purpose is nationalist edit-warring.  They have a battleground mentality, use ethnic insult and aggresively edit war.  The level of disruption in recent days has become intolerable.  It is impossible to have a meaningful discussion as they dismiss any source I bring on spurious and endlessly repeat that wikipedia must only use official data.

<dd>In this thread <a href="#Greece-Albania_articles.2C_some_thoughts." title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise</a>,, I brought up the idea of having a round-table discussion to settle this matter between editors, but I am now convinced this will be impossible as long as these two editors are allowed to participate.  --<a href="" title="User:Athenean">Athenean</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Athenean">talk</a>) 07:38, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Athenean, an admin is ALREADY on this issue, check the talkpage of the article <a href="" title="Cham Albanians">Cham Albanians</a>, and stop accusing your fellow editors without even informing them for this. And please stop commenting others and issues you dont know, without their knowledge, that is totally impolite. --<a href="" title="User:Sarandioti">Sarandioti</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Sarandioti">talk</a>) 07:39, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>And Athenean stop recruiting other editors, to help you. The admin is already on the issue. And stop accusing other people without any point. You and your friends attacked the articles called them POV without even explaining why, and you expect your changes to be accepted? Of course not, they were reverted, and now an admin is on the issue. --<a href="" title="User:Sarandioti">Sarandioti</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Sarandioti">talk</a>) 08:10, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>You accuse us of things we never even implied. But lets se what Xenovatis, Factuarious and the other greek editors wrote: <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#VANDALISM" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#VANDALISM"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#VANDALISM" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#VANDALISM">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#VANDALISM</a></a> <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#NPOV" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#NPOV"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#NPOV" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#NPOV">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#NPOV</a></a>

And you actually try saying that we are the ones who cause the trouble and that we should be excluded from the discussion? You provided no proof, nothing at all, so why did you expect that your POV changes would be accepted?
Anyway matter is already discussed with admin in <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#Neutrality_dispute" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#Neutrality_dispute"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#Neutrality_dispute" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#Neutrality_dispute">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Cham_Albanians#Neutrality_dispute</a></a>

<dd>I&#39;ve removed them and left him a message on his user talk page, providing some possible alternates. As far as I&#39;m aware, 3RR would not be applied to removing fair use images from outside of the article space.

<dd>I&#39;ve blocked the most recently used IP address, and reset Rcool35&#39;s block to a week. Unfortunately the address used can change quite often, so I&#39;ve also semi-protected a couple of articles.</dd>

<dd>In the meanwhile, go ahead and use &#34;reverting vandalism&#34; or &#34;RVV&#34; in your edit summaries - or use your Rollback button -  since this is quite clearly vandalism and ought to be labelled as such, and there&#39;s no reason why you should get in trouble for making more than three reverts a day trying to fix this sort of stuff.  &#60;font color=&#34;006622&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:SheffieldSteel">S&#60;small&#62;HEFFIELD&#60;/small&#62;S&#60;small&#62;TEEL&#60;/small&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;&#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:SheffieldSteel">TALK</a>&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 13:17, 18 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>It&#39;s a good thing I saved the info from the article before it got zapped the second time. I might need to use their services someday, and they are the market leader in full-service commercial real estate in Vermont. I know that&#39;s true, because they said so. :) <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs">carrots</a> 16:23, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>In fairness, though, he was left with the impression that his username was the problem. That&#39;s not the problem, it&#39;s only a symptom. However, he has since been advised to read some policies. That&#39;s where the problem is. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Baseball_Bugs">carrots</a> 16:25, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Not really, he says he read them and his article was fine. We just need to research more and verify for him. see below

I reviewed said guidelines, and i believe the content is all there, and easily verifiable. If there is a better place to continue this discussion, please let me know.&#34; oh well hopefully he&#39;ll learn.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Notability">Notability</span></h4>

<p>For starters, there&#39;s the statement, &#34;Redstone is the market leader in full-service commercial real estate in Vermont.&#34; You need to find some independent sources that back up that assertion. That wouldn&#39;t guarantee that it meets notability standards, but it wouldn&#39;t hurt. Baseball Bugs What&#39;s up, Doc? carrots 16:48, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</p>
