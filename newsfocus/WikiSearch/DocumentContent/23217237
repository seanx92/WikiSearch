<b><i>Wizard People, Dear Reader</i></b>, released in 2004, is an unauthorized, alternative <a href="" title="soundtrack">soundtrack</a> to <i><a href="" title="Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone (film)">Harry Potter and the Sorcerer&#39;s Stone</a></i>, written by <a href="" title="Brad Neely">Brad Neely</a>, a <a href="" title="comic book">comic book</a> <a href="" title="artist">artist</a> from <a href="" title="Fort Smith, Arkansas">Fort Smith, Arkansas</a>.</p>
<p><i>Wizard People, Dear Reader</i> is a narrative retelling of the lives of the characters of <i>The Sorcerer&#39;s Stone</i> and the world in which they live. Presented in the form of a thirty-five chapter <a href="" title="audio book">audio book</a>, this soundtrack is intended to replace the film&#39;s audio track.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Origins">Origins</span></h2>
<p>Brad Neely, in an interview with Chief magazine, described the beginning of the idea as follows:&#60;ref name=Chief_Magazine&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; &#60;blockquote&#62;Anyway, we were at a bar and were getting a good laugh at a guy who was playing pool all by himself while wearing a hoody over his hat, sunglasses under that and headphones on the outside of all of it. So we started riffing on &#34;What could he possibly be listening to?&#34; Someone who I don&#39;t think was me said that he was listening to a book on tape of Harry Potter. And out came the Wizard People narrator. I joked that night that I was going to rush home and record an entire misinformed book on tape of The Sorcerer&#39;s Stone, because I had not and have not ever read any Harry Potter books. Once I started making notes for it I realized that an audio track alone could get boring, so I decided to sync it with the movie. Then I took a week or two and made the damn thing. I love it.&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Presentations">Presentations</span></h2>
<p>In 2004, the <a href="" title="New York Underground Film Festival">New York Underground Film Festival</a> rented a print of the film from Warner Brothers, screened it with the sound off, and played Neely&#39;s soundtrack instead. Shortly thereafter, website Illegal Art made Neely&#39;s work available for free download. In the following year, Neely also performed <i>Wizard People</i> live in several cities, until Warner Brothers took action against theatres that had rented prints, and forced them to cancel the shows.&#60;ref name=Illegalart&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=Hijacking&#62;   &#60;/ref&#62; Rather than taking legal action, however, Warner Bros. reportedly told theaters which had scheduled a performance of the show that further movies produced by the studio would be withheld unless the dates were cancelled.&#60;ref name=Chief_Magazine/&#62; <a href="" title="Carrie McLaren">Carrie McLaren</a>, whose web site, Illegal-art.net, promoted the work, claimed that Mr. Neely&#39;s use of appropriated plot, characters and themes interlaced with humor constituted a separate work of art in its own right.&#60;ref name=Illegalart/&#62;&#60;ref name=NPR&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Humor_and_Writing_Style">Humor and Writing Style</span></h2>

<p>In &#34;Wizard People, Dear Reader,&#34; Neely&#39;s writing ranges from simple childish mockery of the characters, to criticism of the acting and set design of the movie, to awkward metaphors in the prose of the book, to over-dramatic philosophical speeches. <a href="" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry</a> himself is repeatedly referred to as a god, references are made to the &#34;stockpiles of nuclear-level energy&#34; that are his powers, and so on.  At one point, Harry calls himself a &#34;beautiful animal&#34; and a &#34;<a href="#Influence" title="Bhagavad Gita">destroyer of worlds</a>&#34;. He also repeatedly affirms that he is &#34;Harry <i>fucking</i> Potter&#34;. Numerous references are made to characters taking out unseen flasks or drinking alcohol, and Harry is mentioned as being &#34;drunk every day before noon&#34; and producing &#34;many a Wine-Out-of-Nowhere Spell.&#34;</p>
<p><a href="" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione</a> (&#34;Harmony&#34;) is repeatedly described as incredibly ugly, <a href="" title="Severus Snape">Snape</a> (&#34;Snake&#34;) is referred to as a hideous woman, and at one point, Neely simply remarks that &#34;<a href="" title="Ron Weasley">Ron</a> loves <a href="" title="Twizzlers">Twizzlers</a>.&#34; (Ron is almost always referred to as &#34;Ronnie the Bear.&#34;) A range of other insults see less consistent use, and Harry is also described with various symptoms of <a href="" title="dissociative identity disorder">dissociative identity disorder</a>, at one point &#34;leaving his multiple personalities in the locker room.&#34; The use of spells receives similar twists, with <a href="" title="Albus Dumbledore">Dumbledore</a> (&#34;Near-Dead Dumbledore&#34;) casting the &#34;stand without effort&#34; spell due to his advanced age, while Harry casts the &#34;rarely used winter-begone spell&#34; at a scene transition between winter and spring.</p>
<p>The work makes extensive use of simile: <a href="" title="Professor McGonagall">Professor McGonagall</a> (&#34;<a href="" title="Hardcastle and McCormick">Hardcastle McCormick</a>&#34;) is described as having a voice that is &#34;chilling, like a piano made of frozen <a href="" title="Windex">Windex</a>,&#34; while her &#34;eyes float like smears of fish-scales on her candle-wax stump of a head&#34;; the face of <a href="" title="Voldemort">Voldemort</a> (&#34;<a href="" title="Wal-Mart">Val-Mart</a>&#34;) &#34;moves like a <a href="" title="marmalade">marmalade</a> baby just out of the womb.&#34;</p>
<p>Neely segues into multiple fantasy sequences that have nothing to do with what is actually going on in the film. One such scene is where <a href="" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Hagrid</a> (&#34;<a href="" title="Hagar the Horrible">Hagar the Horrible</a>&#34;) is explaining Norbert&#39;s egg. Instead of regaling Hagrid&#39;s encounter with a strange man in a bar, Hagar tells of how Val-Mart impregnated him with the egg, resulting in his survival of a shark attack. Another such scene is where the trio of young wizards encounter <a href="#Fluffy" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Fluffy</a> for the second time and are about to jump down the trap door. Hermione is allegedly decapitated and resurrected without those events occurring onscreen. One of the most elaborate divergences is the sequence where Neville (&#34;the boy known as Upfish&#34;) loses control of his broom. Neely apparently narrates Harry&#39;s present daydream climbing his parents&#39; giant rotten wedding cake thanks to Dumbledore&#39;s body (&#34;using his old ribcage, mouth sockets and such for footholds&#34;). As Harry goes to retrieve a winged key at the finale, Neely narrates that Harry goes into a waking dream-like trance. The entire scene is dominated by a rambling vision of Harry&#39;s in which he conquers the American continent with a telescope, teaching the natives spells, &#34;and they in turn teach him how to fly across the continent at ridiculous speeds. He learns to slay deer with laser beams from his eyes, and how to make all things around the house out of buffalo parts.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.erikkennedy.com/wizardpeopledearreaders.html&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.erikkennedy.com/wizardpeopledearreaders.html&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.erikkennedy.com/wizardpeopledearreaders.html&#60;/ref&#62;</a></p>
<p>There are also many references to other works throughout the soundtrack: Professor <a href="" title="Filius Flitwick">Flitwick</a> is referred to as &#34;Professor Ugnaught&#34; in reference to his similar appearance to the <a href="" title="Ugnaught">Ugnaughts</a> of <a href="" title="Bespin">Bespin</a> in <i><a href="" title="The Empire Strikes Back">The Empire Strikes Back</a></i>, while Val-Mart is made Harry&#39;s true father Ã  la <a href="" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a>. At one point Harry puts on the invisibility cloak and Neely exclaims &#34;Invisibility ON!&#34;, as per <a href="" title="Human Torch">The Human Torch</a> of the <a href="" title="Fantastic 4">Fantastic 4</a>. In an early appearance, Hagrid introduces himself as &#34;gatekeeper and keymaster,&#34; a reference to <a href="" title="Ghostbusters">Ghostbusters</a>.  Neely even refers to future <i>Potter</i> films when he claims that the children are on their way to <a href="" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">the Chamber of Secrets</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_CDs">The CDs</span></h2>
<p>This soundtrack is composed of two audio <a href="" title="CD">CDs</a>, which were made available for free download in MP3 format. The CDs must be played simultaneously with a DVD of the first <i>Harry Potter</i> film, preferably the <a href="" title="North American">North American</a> <a href="" title="DVD">DVD</a>, muted or at low volume.</p>
<p>Two versions of the CD set have been released, the first in summer 2004 and the second in early-mid 2005.  As of February 2007, only the second version is available on the Illegal Art website,  while the original is available at Brad Neely&#39;s website, Creased Comics.  The two versions are very similar: differences include &#34;fixing&#34; the weaker lines from the first version, and a more polished and thoroughly-rehearsed performance by Brad.</p>
<p>The first version&#39;s CDs can be played completely continuously, and there is no need to alter the discs&#39; timing or volume.  In order to play the second version continuously, a delay of approximately three seconds must be inserted between the CDs, and the tracks&#39; volume must be normalized, as the first disc is significantly quieter (approximately 7.7 decibels less) than the second.</p>
<p>Since the CDs are designed to synchronize with the North American release of the film, played at 24 frames per second, the <a href="" title="PAL">PAL</a> video transfers of the film (used in most of the rest of the world) suffer from a <a href="#PAL_speed-up" title="PAL">technical incompatibility</a>, meaning that they run at 25 frames per second, so the MP3 files must be sped up  by 4.2% (or the movie slowed down) in order to retain synchronization. The Canadian release of the film also uses alternate takes to refer to the titular stone as the Philosopher&#39;s Stone (the original name) rather than the Americanized &#34;Sorcerer&#39;s Stone,&#34; and as such, the audio may get slightly out of sync as the film progresses on the Canadian DVD. </p>
