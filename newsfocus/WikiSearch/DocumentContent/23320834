<li><b>Keep</b> no offense, but AFDs like this are exactly why you should check for sources before making an AFD nomination. There are <a class="externallink" href="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?um=1&#38;ned=us&#38;hl=en&#38;q=%22South+Pointe+Park%22+miami&#38;cf=all" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.google.com/archivesearch?um=1&#38;ned=us&#38;hl=en&#38;q=%22South+Pointe+Park%22+miami&#38;cf=all">a lot</a>, I&#39;ve just added 2 and they&#39;re the tip of the iceberg. --<a href="" title="User:Chiliad22">Chiliad22</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Chiliad22">talk</a>) 19:25, 22 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>I don&#39;t really know much about Miami Beach but apparently this park was one of the key pieces in a successful plan to revitalize it in the 1980s. Seems like that should meet any reasonable concept of notability, and the sourcing is obviously there... hundreds of newspaper articles exist about this park. --<a href="" title="User:Chiliad22">Chiliad22</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Chiliad22">talk</a>) 19:55, 22 June 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The thing about saying &#39;no offense&#39; (<i>sic</i>) is that it generally better to simply not say something offensive in the first place. I had prodded this, and someone else pointed out the lack of references. //<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#4B0082;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>roux</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #4B0082;-moz-border-radius-topright:10px;-moz-border-radius-bottomleft:10px;padding:0px 7px;font-size:30%;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a> 21:26, 22 June 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;
<dl>
<dd>How does any of this explain why <i>you</i> didn&#39;t check for references? In your haste to condescendingly add &#39;sic&#39; to your quote (despite the fact that what I wrote was perfectly valid American English) you appear to have ignored my argument. --<a href="" title="User:Chiliad22">Chiliad22</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Chiliad22">talk</a>) 21:47, 22 June 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I really have no interest in indulging your apparent desire for an argument. You think the article should be kept, fine. You should have kept on topic rather than engaging in an attack. //<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#801818;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>roux</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #801818;-moz-border-radius-topright:10px;-moz-border-radius-bottomleft:10px;padding:0px 7px;font-size:30%;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a> 21:49, 22 June 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;
<dl>
<dd>So you basically have no good reason why you didn&#39;t check for references first, and no explanation of why my keep argument is invalid. Why not just withdraw the AFD? Your nomination rational has been debunked. --<a href="" title="User:Chiliad22">Chiliad22</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Chiliad22">talk</a>) 21:51, 22 June 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Of course, people aren&#39;t allowed to make mistakes. I assume you&#39;re perfect and never do something quickly? That&#39;s what I thought. Despite your references, I don&#39;t see anything particularly notable about it. It&#39;s a park, some residents whined about having to put their dogs on leashes, blah blah blah. It&#39;s not like <a href="" title="Hyde Park">Hyde Park</a> or <a href="" title="Central Park">Central Park</a> or <a href="" title="High Park">High Park</a>, which are indeed all notable for the importance they play in their respective cities. //<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#465945;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>roux</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #465945;-moz-border-radius-topright:10px;-moz-border-radius-bottomleft:10px;padding:0px 7px;font-size:30%;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a> 21:56, 22 June 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;
<dl>
<dd>You don&#39;t have to be perfect to spend 10 seconds running a Google News Search... it&#39;s a basic thing you should do prior to AFD. If you can find a policy that says a park has to be as notable as <a href="" title="Central Park">Central Park</a> to have an article, go for it... but <a href="" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> just requires non-trivial coverage, I&#39;ve demonstrated that exists. If you want subjective notability, like I said, it was a major part of the revitalization effort of a pretty high-profile city. --<a href="" title="User:Chiliad22">Chiliad22</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Chiliad22">talk</a>) 22:02, 22 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Speedy keep</b> - Not only has the nominator shown they failed to follow the deletion policy by failing to check for sources, but their &#34;I don&#39;t see anything particularly notable about it. It&#39;s a park, some residents whined about having to put their dogs on leashes, blah blah blah.&#34; demonstrates they do not understand <a href="" title="WP:NOTE">notability on Wikipedia</a>. It is not importance, it is about coverage in independent, reliable sources, which this has four now and likely many more due to the size of the city. <a href="" title="User:Aboutmovies">Aboutmovies</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Aboutmovies">talk</a>) 03:46, 23 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>Actually I do understand it, but this page seems to be more about having a go at me than anything else, so please do me a favour and come up with some more baseless <i>ad hominem</i> crap for my collection. //<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#355E3B;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>roux</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #355E3B;-moz-border-radius-topright:10px;-moz-border-radius-bottomleft:10px;padding:0px 7px;font-size:30%;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a> 06:23, 23 June 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;

<dd>If you understand it, then  time please search for sources first and then make your argument as follows: <i>After a search I found only one source that qualified as a reliable source and it only contained trivial coverage of the park, the article was really about a homeless guy who died in the park.</i> Saying something is <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Pointe_Park&#38;diff=297580128&#38;oldid=294130503" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Pointe_Park&#38;diff=297580128&#38;oldid=294130503">&#34;just a park&#34;</a> or &#34;just a xxxxx&#34; does not show an understanding of how notability works. And as to <a href="" title="ad hominem">ad hominem</a>, no, I attacked your actions and your argument, not attributes of you. An attack on you would be say &#34;x is a big fat jerk&#34; or &#34;x doesn&#39;t know what they are doing because they are Christian/Jewish/Tall/Muslim/Black/White/Rich/Poor&#34;. And lastly, if you had followed <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Pointe_Park&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=297853900" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=South_Pointe_Park&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=297853900">my advice when I removed your prod</a> then we would not all be here wasting time, nor would you feel you are being attacked. The <a href="#REASON" title="WP:DEL">deletion policy</a> is clear (see the sixth bullet point) that sources need to be searched for, and <a href="#Notes" title="Wikipedia:Notability">the notability guideline footnote #10</a> also clearly tells editors that they need to be researching articles before asking that they be deleted. So you will have to excuse me if I don&#39;t get a little blunt with editors who end up wasting people&#39;s time with bad CSD/PROD/AFD nominations, as hopefully this will educated them and prevent similar occurrences in the future. <a href="" title="User:Aboutmovies">Aboutmovies</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Aboutmovies">talk</a>) 06:46, 23 June 2009 (UTC)
