<h1>List of Disney's Hercules characters</h1>

<p> 
 
The following are fictional characters from <a href="" title="The Walt Disney Company">Disney</a>&#39;s 1997 film <i><a href="" title="Hercules (1997 film)">Hercules</a></i> and from the <a href="" title="Hercules (1998 TV series)">1998 TV series</a>. These are heavily interpreted versions of Greek mythology, very different from the classical versions.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hercules">Hercules</span></h2>
<p> 
<b>Hercules</b> (also known as Heracles) is the main protagonist of the film and the TV series who is based on the mythical character, although some aspects of his life differ greatly from the original legend. He was born on <a href="" title="Mount Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> with all the powers of a god, and his parents were <a href="" title="Zeus">Zeus</a> and <a href="" title="Hera">Hera</a> (the King and Queen of all the gods, thus making him a god prince), who has been re-imagined as a loving mother instead of a spiteful stepmother. However, one god is upset about the new arrival: Hercules&#39; evil uncle <a href="#Hades" title="">Hades</a> who wants to take control of <a href="" title="Mount Olympus">Mount Olympus</a> and the world along with all of creation, and he sees that if Hercules chooses to fight when he is older, his plans will be ruined. Knowing that as a god, Hercules is immortal and invulnerable, Hades sends his two lackeys, <a href="#Pain_and_Panic" title="">Pain and Panic</a>, to kidnap Hercules and turn him mortal by means of a magic potion, but the final drop falls wasted on the ground. Pain and Panic discover that because he did not drink the last drop he has retained his godly strength (although Hercule&#39;s strength appears to be exceptional even for a God as no other God is seen performing anything close to his feats of strength) and they are beaten back. <a href="" title="Amphitryon">Amphitryon</a> and <a href="" title="Alcmene">Alcmene</a> adopt the child, considering his arrival a gift from the gods since they are themselves childless. Too late, Zeus and the other gods discover the kidnapping. Because Herc is now mortal, he cannot return to Mt. Olympus. When Hercules has reached adulthood and has passed his training, he sets off with Philoctetes to become a Hero in <a href="" title="Thebes, Greece">Thebes</a>. On his way he saves <a href="#Megara" title="">Megara</a> from <a href="" title="Nessus (mythology)">Nessus</a>, a <a href="" title="centaur">centaur</a> acting as river guardian. Unbeknownst to Herc, Meg is working for Hades (albeit unwillingly), and relates the events to the Lord of the Underworld, by which he learns that Hercules is still alive and so sends a variety of monsters to kill Hercules. But Hercules dispatches every monster Hades sends against him. By this time, Hercules has become the toast of Greece, and he believes himself a true hero, He is greatly upset when Zeus tells him that his celebrity status is not enough to regain his immortality, as being famous isn&#39;t the same as being a hero, and to &#34;look into his heart&#34;. Meg (on assignment from Hades) convinces him to play <a href="" title="hookie">hookie</a>, going on a date. At first she was trying to learn any weakness he might have, but she eventually fell as hard for him as he had for her. The date is ended by Phil, irate at Hercules for skipping training. Phil is knocked off Pegasus, and wakes up in time to learn of Meg&#39;s involvement with Hades. He leaves to tell Hercules, not hearing Meg&#39;s refusal to help destroy Hercules. Hercules, ecstatic from the date, refuses to believe Phil&#39;s warning about Megera, even hitting him in a flash of blind anger, prompting Phil to quit. </p>
<p>Hades, realizing that Meg herself is <a href="" title="Fatal flaw">Herk&#39;s weakness</a>, confronts Hercules, offering Megara&#39;s safety if the hero will give up his strength for 24 hours (long enough for Hades to conquer Olympus). Herc is reluctant to see anyone hurt, but Hades vows that no harm will come to Meg. Hercules agrees, and Hades takes the opportunity to humiliate him before revealing Megara&#39;s role in his scheme. Enacting his plan, Hades sends a <a href="" title="Cyclops">Cyclops</a> to destroy Hercules. Without his superhuman strength and crushed by Meg&#39;s betrayal, Herc is brutally beaten about by the monster but, with a peptalk from the returning Phil, and using his wits, he is able to defeat the Cyclops and send him hurtling off a cliff. The monster&#39;s fall causes a pillar to topple towards Herc and Meg pushes him out of the way, taking the impact of the pillar. This in turn causes Hercules to regain his strength because Hades&#39; end of the bargain is now broken as he promised that Meg wouldn&#39;t get hurt. Hercules leaves Megara in the care of his friends while he rushes off to thwart Hades&#39; invasion of Olympus. Freeing the captured gods, he captures three of the <a href="" title="Titan (mythology)">Titans</a> in the <a href="" title="tornado">tornado</a> body of the fourth and throws them into space, where they explode. He returns to Meg&#39;s side only to learn that her injuries were fatal. However, he then travels to Hades&#39; realm to rescue Meg&#39;s spirit from the <a href="" title="River Styx">River Styx</a>, which swiftly ages mortals upon contact, thus killing them within a short time. Hercules nevertheless enters the pool to rescue Megara&#39;s soul. He is able to reach Meg before he dies and his selfless act fulfills the requirement for being a true hero, thus regaining his godhood. He then punches Hades into the River Styx, and returns Meg&#39;s soul to her body. He is invited by Zeus to live in Olympus, which was indeed originally his wish, but he decides rather to live his life on Earth as a mortal with Megara. </p>
<p>Animator Randy Haycock based the infant version of Hercules on his newborn daughter. He also videotaped a friend&#39;s six-month old and rented movies with babies in them.&#60;ref name=thomas /&#62; Haycock admits that baby Hercules&#39; curly hair comes from his infant daughter&#39;s appearance. He adds, <i><a href="" title="Hercules">Hercules</a></i> mannerisms come right off things I&#39;ve picked up from her&#34;, even though Hercules is more caricatured than a real baby.&#60;ref name=thomas&#62;Thomas, Bob: &#34;Chapter 11: Animating Hercules&#34;, pages 201–220. <i>Disney&#39;s Art of Animation: From Mickey Mouse to Hercules</i>, 1997&#60;/ref&#62; The inspiration for teenage Hercules came from Haycock&#39;s experiences as an adolescent. &#34;I was too tall and skinny for my age, and I was a lousy athlete. At home I broke just about everything...&#34;&#60;ref name=thomas /&#62; Teenage Hercules has big hands and feet that the animator remembers having himself, as well as the lack of coordination.&#60;ref name=thomas /&#62; <a href="" title="Andreas Deja">Andreas Deja</a> was supervising animator for the adult version of Hercules. He studied photographs of <a href="" title="Olympics">Olympic athletes</a>, not the weightlifters with short necks and bulging muscles, but the swimmers, with long necks and natural musculature.&#60;ref name=thomas /&#62; Essentially, he wanted to return to the <a href="" title="Greece">Greek</a> tradition of character drawing. As Deja explains, this means &#34;straight nose, pursed lips – almost cherubic, large eyes, a lidded look...The classic style you find on Greek vases or drawings.&#34;&#60;ref name=thomas /&#62;</p>
<p>The animated series <i><a href="" title="Hercules (animated series)">Hercules</a></i> is set in the intervening period between his teen years and his first journey to Thebes as an adult, while he is still in training on Phil&#39;s island. The series also reveals that, on Zeus&#39;s instruction, Hercules attends a high school called the <a href="" title="Prometheus Academy">Prometheus Academy</a>. </p>
<p>Hercules has also appeared in the <i><a href="" title="Kingdom Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></i> series of video games. In the former, <a href="" title="Sora (Kingdom Hearts)">Sora</a> must help Hercules defeat the evil Hades who, having joined <a href="" title="Maleficent (Disney)">Maleficent</a>&#39;s main group of <a href="" title="Disney Villains">Disney Villains</a>, is still trying to take over Olympus. In the first game, he is voiced by <a href="" title="Sean Astin">Sean Astin</a>, but Donovan reprises his role in the second game.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Phil">Phil</span></h2>
<p> 
<b>Phil</b> (also known as Philoctetes), based on the mythological <a href="" title="Philoctetes">Philoctetes</a>, is a <a href="" title="satyr">satyr</a> and a trainer of aspiring heroes who has often been disappointed by his trainees&#39; shortcomings. This however, seems to be a confusion with the myth of <a href="" title="Chiron">Chiron</a>, as Phil states that he trained Achilles and Jason of the Argonauts, both disciples of Chiron. He also says that he trained <a href="" title="Odysseus">Odysseus</a>, <a href="" title="Perseus">Perseus</a>, <a href="" title="Theseus">Theseus</a> -- &#34;a lot of &#39;yeuseus.&#39;&#34; Phil also trained <a href="" title="Bellerophon">Bellerophon</a>, but he was equally a failure. On several occasions, Phil will explain something by saying &#34;Two words&#34;, and then his next statement will be either one word or three, prompting other characters to count off the number of words on their fingers. Phil has long-since retired after failing to train a successful hero, but is convinced to train the callow young Hercules. While training Hercules or watching him fight, Phil would constantly utter at least one of his 101 rules.</p>
<p>After his training is complete, Phil, Hercules and Pegasus set out for the city of <a href="" title="Thebes, Greece">Thebes</a> to prove Hercules&#39; newfound worth. Along the way, Hercules saves a woman named <a href="" title="Megara (mythology)">Megara</a> from being pestered by the centaur <a href="" title="Nessus (mythology)">Nessus</a>, and becomes attracted to her, while Phil immediately clashes with her, considering her a distraction from Hercules&#39; activities. Phil becomes a personal manager to the celebrity Hercules has become. Later in the film, Phil discovers that Megara is working for <a href="" title="Hades">Hades</a>, her mission being to find Hercules&#39; weakness. Phil tries to warn Hercules, but abandons him after an argument ensues. When Hercules loses his powers to Hades, it is Megara who convinces Phil to return to Hercules, motivating him into battling and defeating the Cyclops through improvisation. During the fight, Megara is mortally wounded by a falling column to save Hercules, and Phil is left taking care of the dying Megara while Hercules fights Hades and the Titans. After Hercules defeats Hades, Phil goes with Hercules to Mount Olympus, where he is seen flirting with <a href="" title="Aphrodite">Aphrodite</a>. When Hercules and his friends return to Thebes, Phil is gratified when the people refer to the mighty and triumphant Hercules as &#34;Phil&#39;s boy&#34;.</p>
<p>The prequel <i><a href="" title="Hercules: Zero to Hero">Hercules: Zero to Hero</a></i> and the subsequent TV series <i><a href="" title="Hercules: The Animated Series">Disney&#39;s Hercules</a></i> are set during the time when teen Hercules is training under Phil and attending the <a href="#Prometheus_Academy" title="">Prometheus Academy</a>.</p>
<p>Phil has also appeared in the Disney/<a href="" title="Square Enix">Square Enix</a> video game series <i><a href="" title="Kingdom Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></i>, as well as in the TV series <i><a href="" title="Disney&#39;s House of Mouse">Disney&#39;s House of Mouse</a></i>. In the film, Philoctetes&#39; voice is provided by <a href="" title="Danny DeVito">Danny DeVito</a>, while <a href="" title="Robert Costanzo">Robert Costanzo</a> fills the role in the character&#39;s video game and television appearances. <a href="" title="Ichirō Nagai">Ichirō Nagai</a> supplies Phil&#39;s Japanese voice, while <a href="" title="Lakis Lazopoulos">Lakis Lazopoulos</a> was cast for Phil&#39;s voice in the Greek language version of the film.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Megara">Megara</span></h2>
<p> </p>
<p><b>Megara</b> (also known as Meg) is a young mortal woman unwillingly working for Hades, and the romantic love interest of Hercules. Sometime during the events of <i>Hercules</i>, Meg went to Hades and <a href="" title="Deal with the Devil">sold her soul</a> to revive a lover of hers who had died. Hades agreed on the condition that she serve him forever, which she accepted. However, shortly after her lover was revived, he fell in love with someone else and left Meg still locked in servitude to Hades. This background story of the character alludes to the myth of <a href="" title="Alcestis">Alcestis</a>, who dies by proxy for her husband <a href="" title="Admetus">Admetus</a>.</p>
<p>When Meg first appears onscreen, Hercules encounters her in the middle of trying to recruit Nessus. Meg, not believing that Hercules can help, simply tells him she can handle it, and after Nessus and he fight, watches with some amusement. She at first believes Hercules is faking his shy and innocent personality due to bad experiences with other men. She then reports back to Hades, who learns that Hercules is still alive. Later, in Thebes, Meg rushes up to Hercules, telling him two kids (Pain and Panic in disguise) are trapped in a gorge. He falls for it, and Meg silently pleads with him from a distance to leave before Hades&#39; plan goes into effect, but is forced to watch as Hercules fights and defeats the <a href="" title="Lernaean Hydra">Hydra</a>. After several more victories, Meg is openly smug and confident that Hercules will survive. Hades offers Meg her freedom in exchange for discovering Hercules&#39; weakness. Meg goes to Hercules and convinces him to take the day off with her, to which he quickly agrees. During the date, Hercules reveals his strong romantic feelings for Meg, and promises that he will never ever hurt her. They nearly engage in a romantic and loving kiss, but are stopped by Phil. Meg finds herself falling deeply and strongly romantically in love with Hercules. She tries to deny her true deep romantic feelings, but the <a href="" title="Muses">Muses</a> convince her to stop denying the way she really feels.</p>
<p>Hades then intervenes, and Meg tells him that she will <i>not</i> help him hurt Hercules anymore, due to her recently surfaced strong romantic feelings for him, and that he has no weaknesses. A furious Hades reminds her that he owns her, and upon seeing her newfound deep romantic love and affections for Hercules, realizes that Herc&#39;s strong romantic feelings for her <i>are</i> his weakness and uses her as leverage to convince Hercules to give up his enhanced strength for one day in return for her safety; if the deal is broken, his superhuman strength will return. Hades then reveals Meg worked for Hades the whole time, and Hercules leaves, disheartened at learning of Meg&#39;s betrayal. Meg then goes to find Phil, as he is the only one who can talk sense into Hercules. They return to see Hercules has been badly beaten by the Cyclops, and convince him to fight back. After seeing a column collapse where he is standing, due to the <a href="" title="Cyclops">Cyclops</a> Hercules was fighting, Meg pushes him out of the way, and it collapses on her instead. When he asks why, she explains that &#34;people always do crazy things- when they&#39;re in love.&#34; Meg dies from her injuries, so Hercules goes to the <a href="" title="Underworld">Underworld</a> to get her spirit back. He makes a deal with Hades where he will exchange himself in return for Meg&#39;s life, but in the process of saving her, becomes a full-fledged immortal god again. After her soul is returned, he explains that he did it for the same reason she gave her life for him- he is deeply/strongly romantically in love with her as well. They are risen to Olympus, and Meg watches as Hercules is finally accepted as a god. However, he declines his place to stay with her on Earth; Meg and Hercules finally passionately kiss, apparently continuing her life with him and his foster parents.</p>
<p>Megara has fair skin and waist-length brown hair which is pulled into a <a href="" title="ponytail">ponytail</a>. She appears to wear purple makeup to match the color of her eyes and Grecian-style dress.</p>
<p>In <i><a href="" title="Hercules: The Animated Series">Hercules: The Animated Series</a></i>, Meg appeared twice, once as a teenager and once as an adult from the movie timeline. She meets Hercules, offering a chance to prove himself as a hero. Having him retrieve her the amphora so she can use it to forget about Adonis who she had a blind date with that went badly. They do retrieve it from Ares&#39; sons, but Meg leaves Hercules to escape. She is immediately taken to the Underworld by Pain and Panic; Hercules, despite her betrayal, goes after her. During a fight for the amphora, Meg tells Hercules that she liked him from the start. They almost kiss, but the amphora&#39;s water is dropped on them, causing them to forget how they met, and reinforcing the fact that Hercules and Meg never established any relationship until the film. Another episode, &#34;Hercules and the Yearbook&#34;, takes place after the events of the film and features Hercules and Meg moving his stuff from Phil&#39;s island. <a href="" title="Hermes">Hermes</a> delivers a special package, which Hercules immediately hides from Meg. Phil reveals all of Hercules&#39; incidents during his school time, and Hercules tells Meg he did not want to show her the yearbook because he wants her to see him as a hero. Meg tells him that she accepts that part of his life as an awkward phase, and loves him just the same. However, this does not stop Hercules from having Hermes retrieve Meg&#39;s own yearbook where it is revealed Meg was a cheerleader and in the glee club.</p>
<p>Meg also appeared in <i><a href="" title="Kingdom Hearts II">Kingdom Hearts II</a></i> and meets Sora and co. in the Underworld entrance. She later assists Sora in the fight against the Hydra by providing useful items. She also appears in <i><a href="" title="Disney&#39;s House of Mouse">Disney&#39;s House of Mouse</a></i> as a guest.</p>
<p>Meg is loosely based on the mythological <a href="" title="Megara (mythology)">Megara (mythology)</a>, first wife of Hercules in Greek Mythology, with undertones from another mythological figure, Deianira, who in Greek Mythology was the third wife of Hercules.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pegasus">Pegasus</span></h2>
<p> 
<b>Pegasus</b>, based on the mythological <a href="" title="Pegasus">Pegasus</a>, is the winged horse of Hercules. He is very jealous of the relationship between his master and Meg. He was created by Zeus as a gift at birth. It consists of <a href="" title="cirrus">cirrus</a>, <a href="" title="nimbostratus">nimbostratus</a>, and <a href="" title="cumulonimbus">cumulonimbus</a>. It is very true and a great &#34;friend&#34; of Hercules and helps in everything, and has a bird brain.</p>
<p>Pegasus has also appeared in the Disney/<a href="" title="Square Enix">Square Enix</a> video game <i><a href="" title="Kingdom Hearts II">Kingdom Hearts II</a></i>.
 </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Hades">Hades</span></h2>
<p> 
<b>Hades</b> is the main antagonist of the film and the TV series. He is also the brother of Zeus and Poseidon. Unlike the mythological <a href="" title="Hades">Hades</a>, who is for the most part a relatively passive deity doing a sometimes nasty job, this version is a fast-talking, ornery, evil deity, reminiscent of <a href="" title="Satan">Satan</a>, as well as sleazy dealers, notably persuasive Hollywood Agent types and car dealers. In all of his appearances, Hades has been voiced by <a href="" title="James Woods">James Woods</a>. The character&#39;s mannerisms and other tendencies were partly due to James Woods&#39;s using &#34;car-dealer&#34;-style speech while providing the voice of Hades. Hades is described as &#34;mean&#34; and &#34;ruthless&#34; by the Muses. His status as a god makes him immortal, but not invincible. His status as a god likely makes him one of the most powerful if not the most powerful Disney villain. He wears a dark robe with a skull shaped perone, which is a pin used to fasten a chiton around the body at the shoulder, and his hair is a glowing blue flame, which flares whenever he becomes enraged (if he&#39;s excited, it stays blue and if he&#39;s angry or frustrated, it turns yellow while his whole body turns red), and can also be extinguished (his hair was blown out at one point by Pegasus). James Woods has stated that Hades is one of his favorite roles in his career, and he will gladly reprise the role whenever asked.</p>
<p>In <i>Hercules</i>, Hades seeks to overthrow <a href="#Other_characters" title="">Zeus</a> and rule Mount Olympus, Greece, the Earth and the rest of creation for himself. Upon visiting the Fates, he learns that he could succeed by releasing the Titans in eighteen years, but if Zeus&#39;s son, Hercules, is to fight Hades, he will fail. Hades sends his demons, <a href="#Pain_and_Panic" title="">Pain and Panic</a>, to kidnap baby Hercules and give him a potion that would render him mortal. Hercules needs to drink every last drop for it to work, but the last drop is lost. Thus Hercules, while mortal, retains his god-like strength and spends his life on Earth.</p>
<p>Later, a young woman named <a href="#Megara" title="">Megara</a> sells her soul to Hades so that he will return her lover&#39;s soul. He does, but Meg&#39;s lover ungratefully dumps her for another girl shortly afterwards. Meg remains trapped as a slave to Hades, and he uses her beauty, charm and intelligence as an advantage to persuade monsters to join his army. After discovering that Hercules is still alive, Hades sends numerous grotesque beasts to finish Hercules off, only for Hercules to slay every one with ease! When he finds out that Hercules has strongly fallen romantically in love with Megara, he uses this to his advantage and makes a deal with Hercules: Herc must give up his God-like superhuman strength for the next twenty-four hours (secretly the same twenty-four hours he will use to take over Olympus) in exchange for Meg&#39;s freedom. Herc agrees, as long as Meg will be safe from any harm. Hades then reveals that Megara was working for him the whole time, crushing Hercules&#39; will to fight. 
Hades then releases the <a href="#The_Titans" title="">Titans</a>, who defeat and imprison the gods, and sends the <a href="" title="Cyclops">Cyclops</a> to kill the weakened and discouraged Hercules to keep him from getting in the way, but Hercules defeats the monster using his wits.</p>
<p>However, Megara is grievously injured saving Hercules from a falling pillar, negating Hades&#39;s deal that Meg would not be hurt. Hercules is thus given his Godly powers back and returns to Mount Olympus where he easily takes down the Titans and frees the gods. Hades loses his temper, but he taunts Hercules that he at least has a parting gift; while Hercules was fighting the Titans, Megara died from her injuries. Hercules travels to the Underworld to rescue her soul and offers himself to Hades in exchange for Megara&#39;s freedom. He swims into the <a href="" title="River Styx">River Styx</a> to retrieve her soul. It almost kills him, when his full cosmic Godhood is restored by his being willing to risk his own life to save the woman he romantically loves-Meg. 
Hercules emerges from the pit, alive and immortal with Megara&#39;s soul in his arms, much to Hades&#39; anger. Knowing that he can&#39;t stop Hercules in his path, Hades begs the hero to try and ease things with him and the other gods, but Hercules loses his temper and slugs his uncle into the River Styx, where he is swarmed by vengeful souls and dragged to the depths. (However, Hades does not die, seeing as he is immortal, but the fact that he is <i>not</i> invincible makes being attacked by murderously vengeful souls a nonetheless extremely painful experience.) Hades&#39; relationship with Megara is oddly similar to Ned Trent (also played by James Woods) relationship with Sharon Stone&#39;s character in <i><a href="" title="The Specialist">The Specialist</a></i>. </p>
<p>Later, with the return of Hercules in the form of <a href="" title="Hercules: The Animated Series">an animated series</a>, Hades also re-appeared, and had many appearances trying to take over Olympus, such as tricking the other gods into swimming in the waters of Lethe to forget their pasts, arranging for the sun to be stolen, or sending Cerberus after a temporarily mortal Zeus. One episode even had a <a href="" title="Crossover fiction">crossover</a> where <a href="" title="Jafar">Jafar</a> makes a deal with Hades, in order to make Hercules and <a href="" title="Aladdin (Disney character)">Aladdin</a> fight each other. While Hades and Jafar had numerous things in common, Jafar&#39;s evil laugh consistently got on the more smooth-talking Hades&#39; nerves – at least until he tried it for himself, calling it &#34;cleansing.&#34; This entire series ignores a certain fact about the film, however: in the movie, Hades still thought Hercules was dead throughout his high school days, but in the series, they have many interactions during that time.</p>
<p>Hades appears in the <i><a href="" title="Kingdom Hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a></i> series of video games. He was originally in league with <a href="" title="Maleficent (Disney)">Maleficent</a>, using the Heartless to try to take over the worlds. Hades wanted to dispose of Hercules and tricked <a href="" title="Cloud Strife">Cloud Strife</a> into challenging Hercules in the Preliminaries at the Olympus Colliseum. In return, Hades &#34;promised&#34; Cloud he will lead him to <a href="" title="Sephiroth (Final Fantasy VII)">Sephiroth</a>. However, when <a href="" title="Sora (Kingdom Hearts)">Sora</a> arrived, Hades changed plans and had Cloud attack Sora first. When Cloud refused to kill Sora (or was defeated by him, depending on the outcome), Hades sends out <a href="" title="Cerberus">Cerberus</a> to take care of Cloud. Hercules arrived to get Cloud to safety while Sora &#38; company dealt with Cerberus. After Maleficent&#39;s defeat, Hades himself battles Sora and lost as all his schemes against Sora and the others end in failure. In <i><a href="" title="Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories">Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories</a></i>, a facsimile Hades appeared as token of Sora&#39;s memory and the darkness in <a href="" title="Kingdom Hearts Riku">Riku&#39;s</a> heart. In <i><a href="" title="Kingdom Hearts II">Kingdom Hearts II</a></i>, Hades&#39;s desire to kill Hercules is still undeterred. After joining forces with <a href="" title="Pete (Disney)">Pete</a>, and probably Maleficent through him, Hades decides to use <a href="" title="Āron">Auron</a>, who has already died, to fight against Hercules and kill him; however, Auron rebels against Hades and fights him, only to be interrupted by Sora, <a href="" title="Donald Duck">Donald Duck</a> and <a href="" title="Goofy">Goofy</a>. They fight Hades, but, due to the Underworld curse, he is invincible to their attacks. Hades then sends Cerberus and later the Hydra against Sora and his friends. Upon discovering that Sora&#39;s Keyblade could unlock any lock, Hades initially plans to use it to unlock the Underdrome, the Underworld&#39;s own coliseum. However, when Pete informs him that the Keyblade will only work for Sora, Hades kidnaps Meg and traps her in the locked Underdrome, forcing Sora to unlock it to rescue her. After defeating Pete and the Hydra again, Sora and his friends eventually fight and defeat Hades. However, Hades survives and acts as a challenger in the last tournaments, which are unlocked near the end of the game. In the prequel, <i><a href="" title="Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep">Kingdom Hearts Birth by Sleep</a></i>, he attempts to use Terra to kill Hercules, but Terra resists the Darkness in his heart, so Hades places <a href="" title="Zack Fair">Zack</a> under his control to eliminate both Terra and Hercules, but Terra defeats Zack and frees him from Hades&#39; influence. Later, Hades and the Ice Colossus (a replica of the Ice Titan) both fight Aqua in the Coliseum, but Aqua defeats the both of them and Hades flees to the Underworld to further his plans. James Woods reprises his role for the English versions of the games, while his Japanese voice in all the games is done by Kyusaku Shimada.</p>
<p>Hades stars in &#34;Villains Tonight&#34; on the Disney Magic and Disney Dream. &#34;Villains Tonight&#34; is a musical stage show featuring many different villains from various Disney films, including Doctor Facilier, Ursula, Scar, Yzma, Maleficent, Evil Queen, Captain Hook, Cruella de Vil, Jafar, and his two sidekicks Pain and Panic. The story here is Hades has &#34;softened a bit&#34; and made the Underworld a fun place. Unfortunately, the Fates tell him he has until midnight to get more evil or he will no longer rule the Underworld. So he summons the most evil villains in his quest to become more evil.</p>
<p>Hades is one of the <a href="" title="Disney Villains">Disney Villains</a> summoned by the <a href="#Disney_version" title="Queen (Snow White)">Evil Queen</a> to fight Mickey Mouse in <i><a href="" title="Fantasmic!">Fantasmic!</a></i>. Hades also appears in several episodes of <i><a href="" title="Disney&#39;s House of Mouse">Disney&#39;s House of Mouse</a></i>. In one episode, he tried to ask Maleficent out on a date and asked Mickey for advice. When Mickey&#39;s kind and nice ways did not sway Maleficent, Hades won her over by showing his own, fiery personality in a fit of rage towards Mickey. The two were referred to by Minnie Mouse as &#34;a match not made in heaven&#34;. On another occasion, when Pete tries to get the House closed by turning up the thermostat- Mickey&#39;s contract stating that the House will close if it is ever empty-, Hades&#39; ability to tolerate heat means that he remains comfortable in the House despite the rise in temperature, thus allowing Mickey to keep the House open. He is also one of the main villains in the full-length spin-off <i><a href="" title="Mickey&#39;s House of Villains">Mickey&#39;s House of Villains</a></i>; James Woods only provides the voice for one line (&#34;Ha – love that&#34;), and <a href="" title="Rob Paulsen">Rob Paulsen</a> provides the singing voice when Hades sings the lines &#34;Where everyone&#39;s a friend of mine!&#34; and &#34;What a place for breakin&#39; bread!&#34; in the song &#34;It&#39;s Our House Now!&#34;.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pain_and_Panic">Pain and Panic</span></h2>
<p> 
<b>Pain</b> and <b>Panic</b> are a pair of pint-sized, <a href="" title="devil">devil</a> shaped <a href="" title="demon">demons</a> (also called <i>imps</i>) in the <a href="" title="Walt Disney Pictures">Disney</a> <a href="" title="animation">animated</a> feature <i><a href="" title="Hercules (1997 film)">Hercules</a></i>. Pain is a fat, red-shaded demon, and Panic is skinny and blue-green. They are the minions of the film&#39;s villain, <a href="" title="Hades (Disney)">Hades</a>. Pain is voiced by <a href="" title="Bobcat Goldthwait">Bobcat Goldthwait</a> and Panic by <a href="" title="Matt Frewer">Matt Frewer</a>. </p>
<p>Panic is <a href="" title="paranoid">paranoid</a>, twitchy, panicky and easily spooked, as his name suggests, but he appears to be relatively smart and is very cautious. He appears to be more honest than Pain. For example, when he says, &#34;Hades is gonna kill us when he finds out what happened!&#34; Pain replies, &#34;You mean <i>if</i> he finds out.&#34; And Panic replies, &#34;&#39;If&#39;. &#39;If&#39; is good.&#34; Pain, on the other hand, is bossy, hot-tempered, and sly, but also clumsy, impulsive and liable to get into painful situations, and seems to be less intelligent than Panic. One instance was when Hades asked them how they kill a god. Pain didn&#39;t know while Panic answered correctly.</p>
<p>Both possess the ability to <a href="" title="Shapeshifting">shapeshift</a> into almost any form. They frequently manage to irritate Hades even more than usual, and he is always ready to punish them severely for any mistakes. He also threatens them with torture. Ironically, since they are demons, even Hades cannot kill them – but it is made clear repeatedly that they can still feel pain, and since both Hades and they are immortal, they endeavor not to anger him. It is unclear why they even serve Hades, though they seem to do so out of fear or because he owns their souls.</p>
<p>In the movie, Hades sends them to kidnap baby Hercules, make him mortal, and kill him. The imps obey and capture him in the middle of the night, but fail to kill him, and only half-succeed in making him mortal: he keeps his godlike strength, allowing him to dispose of the pair before they have a chance to kill him as snakes (a reference to the original Hercules myth). Not wanting Hades to know about their failure, they tell him that Hercules is dead. Many years later Hades discovers that Hercules is actually alive. To try and grovel sufficiently they become insects, reminding Hades they could still kill Hercules in the time left. Throughout the rest of the movie, they&#39;re seen either cheering Hades&#39;s monsters on, grovelling to Hades, or using their shape-shifting powers to contact Hades&#39;s spy, Meg. In rare moments of competence, they manage to trap Pegasus by pretending to be a mare, and even capture Hermes in the assault on Olympus, herding the gods off the mountain in chains. At the end of the movie, Hades is punched into the river <a href="" title="Styx">Styx</a>, and they are left behind, hoping that he won&#39;t return. Their fate after that is unknown.</p>
<p>Pain and Panic also appear in the <a href="" title="Hercules: The Animated Series"><i>Hercules</i> TV series</a>, and still serve as Hades&#39;s lackeys. They made many brief appearances in the <i><a href="" title="House of Mouse">House of Mouse</a></i> television series, usually along with Hades (though there was one episode in which they broke up <a href="" title="Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a> and <a href="" title="Jiminy Cricket">Jiminy Cricket</a> without Hades&#39;s aid) and had a very small role in <i><a href="" title="Kingdom Hearts II">Kingdom Hearts II</a></i>, where they are working for Hades and work at the Underdrome, but have no other purpose.</p>

<ul>
<li><b><a href="" title="Zeus">Zeus</a></b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Rip Torn">Rip Torn</a> in the film, <a href="" title="Corey Burton">Corey Burton</a> in the TV series): The ruler of Mount Olympus and Hercules&#39; father. Many eons ago Zeus imprisoned the deadly Titans, who threatened to destroy the world, deep beneath the ocean where they would remain for the rest of eternity undisturbed. However he was unaware that the next planetary alignment would reveal the location of the Titans prison. He tells his son that to join the gods, he must become a hero, which he defines as something more than being famous. Zeus is betrayed by Hades, but Hercules later saves him and Olympus, and Zeus reveals that for willingly giving his life to save Meg, he is finally a true hero and can be a god. Nonetheless, he is supportive of his son&#39;s decision to remain with Meg. Zeus was heavily edited by Disney as he is different from his portrayal in mythology. Zeus had many affairs with mortal woman and Hercules was born as a result of one of those, but this was changed in the movie due to it being inappropriate for younger audiences. According to the <i><a href="" title="Disney&#39;s House of Mouse">House Of Mouse</a></i> episode, &#34;Unplugged Club&#34;, his <a href="" title="Thunderbolt">lightning bolt</a> is used to recharge the club with red and black <a href="" title="electric cable">electric cables</a> thanks to <a href="" title="Mickey Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> who calls him Big Z.</li>

The boy who escaped from the <a href="" title="Labyrinth">Labyrinth</a> with his father on wax wings appears as a complete nut (he was &#34;brain-fried&#34; by flying too close to the <a href="" title="Sun">Sun</a>). Despite his accident, Icarus still flies every chance he gets resulting in a few more encounters with the sun. Icarus is very adaptive and hence could adjust to about every situation, except when he is very jealous and acts irrational. He could become an ultra serious soldier at boot camp or a nearly identical version of Hades himself. Thankfully, at the end of each episode, he reverts to his own odd self. His father <a href="" title="Daedalus">Daedalus</a> is a teacher in the academy and Icarus doesn&#39;t acknowledge his parents&#39; divorce.

She tolerates his presence because before Hercules joined the trio she would have had no friends. But even after she gained Hercules as a friend she still continues to socialise with Icarus and even admitted to him that she considers him a good friend.</li></ul>

But if one true friend accepts her for who she is, he&#39;d turn her human permanently.
