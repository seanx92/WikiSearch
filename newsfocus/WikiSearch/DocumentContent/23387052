<b>Popeye the Sailor</b> is a cartoon <a href="" title="character (arts)">fictional character</a> created by <a href="" title="E. C. Segar">Elzie Crisler Segar</a>,&#60;ref name=&#34;EBA&#34;&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9066592/Elzie-Segar" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9066592/Elzie-Segar">Segar, Elzie (Crisler) – Encyclopædia Britannica Article</a>&#60;/ref&#62; who has appeared in <a href="" title="comic strip">comic strips</a> and <a href="" title="animated cartoon">animated cartoons</a> in the cinema as well as on television. He first appeared in the daily <a href="" title="King Features">King Features</a> comic strip <b><i>Thimble Theatre</i></b> on January 17, 1929. <b><i>Popeye</i></b> also became the strip&#39;s title in later years.</p>
<p>Although Segar&#39;s <i>Thimble Theatre</i> strip was in its tenth year when Popeye made his debut in 1929, the sailor quickly became the main focus of the strip and <i>Thimble Theatre</i> became one of King Features&#39; most popular properties during the 1930s. <i>Thimble Theatre</i> was continued after Segar&#39;s death in 1938 by several <a href="" title="comics artist">writers and artists</a>, most notably Segar&#39;s assistant <a href="" title="Bud Sagendorf">Bud Sagendorf</a>. The strip, now titled <i>Popeye</i>, continues to appear in first-run installments in its <a href="" title="Sunday strip">Sunday edition</a>, written and drawn by <a href="" title="Hy Eisman">Hy Eisman</a>. The daily strips are <a href="" title="reprint">reprints</a> of old Sagendorf stories.</p>
<p>In 1933, <a href="" title="Max Fleischer">Max</a> and <a href="" title="Dave Fleischer">Dave Fleischer</a>&#39;s <a href="" title="Fleischer Studios">Fleischer Studios</a> adapted the <i>Thimble Theatre</i> characters into a series of <i>Popeye the Sailor</i> theatrical cartoon shorts for <a href="" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. These cartoons proved to be among the most popular of the 1930s, and the Fleischers—and later Paramount&#39;s own <a href="" title="Famous Studios">Famous Studios</a>—continued production through 1957. The cartoons are now owned by <a href="" title="Turner Entertainment">Turner Entertainment</a>, a subsidiary of <a href="" title="Time Warner">Time Warner</a>, and distributed by sister company <a href="" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> Entertainment.</p>
<p>Over the years, Popeye has also appeared in <a href="" title="comic book">comic books</a>, <a href="" title="cartoon series">television cartoons</a>, <a href="" title="arcade game">arcade</a> and <a href="" title="video game">video games</a>, hundreds of <a href="" title="advertisements">advertisements</a> and peripheral products, and a <a href="" title="Popeye (film)">1980 live-action film</a> directed by <a href="" title="Robert Altman">Robert Altman</a> starring comedian <a href="" title="Robin Williams">Robin Williams</a> as Popeye.</p>
<p>In 2002, <i><a href="" title="TV Guide">TV Guide</a></i> ranked Popeye # 20 on its &#34;50 Greatest Cartoon Characters of All Time&#34; lists.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; </p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fictional_character_and_story">Fictional character and story</span></h2>
<p>Differences in Popeye&#39;s story and characterization show up depending upon which medium he is presented in. While Swee&#39;Pea is definitively the ward of Popeye in the comic strips, he is often depicted as belonging to <a href="" title="Olive Oyl">Olive Oyl</a> in cartoons. The cartoons also occasionally feature family members of Popeye that have never appeared in the strip, notably his look-alike nephews Peepeye, Pupeye, Pipeye and Poopeye.</p>
<p>Even though there is no absolute sense of continuity in the stories, certain <a href="" title="plot (narrative)">plot</a> and presentation elements remain mostly constant, including purposeful contradictions in Popeye&#39;s capabilities. Though at times he seems bereft of <a href="" title="manners">manners</a> or uneducated, Popeye is often depicted as capable of coming up with solutions to problems that (to the police, or, most importantly, the <a href="" title="scientific community">scientific community</a>) seem insurmountable. Popeye has, alternatively, displayed <a href="" title="Sherlock Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a>-like investigative prowess (determining for instance that his beloved Olive was abducted by estimating the depth of the villains&#39; footprints in the sand), scientific ingenuity (as his construction, within a few hours, of a &#34;spinach-drive&#34; <a href="" title="spacecraft">spaceship</a>), or oversimplified (yet successful) <a href="" title="diplomatic">diplomatic</a> argumentation (by presenting to diplomatic conferences his own existence --- and superhuman strength --- as the only true guarantee of world peace). Popeye&#39;s pipe also proves to be highly versatile. Among other things, it has served as a cutting torch, jet engine, propeller, periscope, and, of course, a whistle with which he produces his trademark toot. Popeye also on occasion eats spinach through his pipe, sometimes sucking in the can itself along with the contents. He seldom appears to use it to smoke tobacco.</p>
<p>Popeye&#39;s vastly versatile exploits are deemed even more amusing by a few standard plot elements. One is the <a href="" title="love triangle">love triangle</a> between Popeye, Olive and <a href="" title="Bluto">Bluto</a>, and the latter&#39;s endless machinations to claim Olive at Popeye&#39;s expense. Another is his (near-saintly) perseverance to overcome any obstacle to please Olive – who, quite often, renounces Popeye for Bluto&#39;s dime-store advances. She is the only character Popeye will permit to give him a thumping. Finally, in terms of the endless array of villain plots, Popeye mostly comes to the truth by &#34;accidentally&#34; sneaking up on the villains, the moment they are bragging about their schemes&#39; ingenuity, thus revealing everything to an enraged Popeye, who uses his &#34;fisks&#34; in the name of justice.</p>

<p><i>Thimble Theatre</i> was created by <a href="" title="King Features Syndicate">King Features Syndicate</a> comic writer/artist <a href="" title="E.C. Segar">E.C. Segar</a>, and was his third published strip. The strip first appeared in the <i><a href="" title="New York Journal">New York Journal</a></i>, a newspaper operated by King Features owner <a href="" title="William Randolph Hearst">William Randolph Hearst</a>, on December 19, 1919 before later expanding into more papers. In its early years, the strip featured characters acting out various stories and scenarios in <a href="" title="theatre">theatrical</a> style (hence the strip&#39;s name).</p>
<p><i>Thimble Theatre&#39;s</i> first main characters/actors were the thin Olive Oyl and her boyfriend, <a href="" title="Harold Hamgravy">Harold Hamgravy</a>. After the strip moved away from its initial focus, it settled into a comedy-<a href="" title="adventure">adventure</a> style featuring Olive, Ham Gravy, and Olive&#39;s enterprising brother, <a href="" title="Castor Oyl">Castor Oyl</a>. Olive&#39;s parents, Cole and Nana Oyl, also made frequent appearances.</p>
<p>Popeye first appeared in the strip on January 17, 1929 as a minor character. He was initially hired by Castor Oyl and Ham to crew a ship for a voyage to Dice Island, the location of a casino owned by the crooked gambler Fadewell. Castor intended to break the bank at the casino using the unbeatable good luck conferred by stroking the hairs on the head of Bernice the Whiffle Hen. Weeks later, on the trip back, Popeye was shot many times by Jack Snork, a stooge of Fadewell&#39;s, but survived by rubbing Bernice&#39;s head. After the adventure, Popeye left the strip, but due to reader reaction, he was quickly brought back.

The Popeye character became so popular that he was given a larger role, and the strip was expanded into many more newspapers as a result. Though initial strips presented Olive as being less than impressed with Popeye, she eventually left Ham Gravy to become Popeye&#39;s girlfriend and Ham Gravy left the strip as a regular. Over the years, however, she has often displayed a fickle attitude towards the sailor. Castor Oyl continued to come up with get-rich-quick schemes and enlisted Popeye in his misadventures. Eventually he settled down as a <a href="" title="detective">detective</a> and later on bought a ranch out West. Castor has seldom appeared in recent years.</p>
<p>In 1933, Popeye received a foundling baby in the mail, whom he adopted and named &#34;<a href="" title="Swee&#39;Pea">Swee&#39;Pea</a>.&#34; Other regular characters in the strip were <a href="" title="J. Wellington Wimpy">J. Wellington Wimpy</a>, a <a href="" title="hamburger">hamburger</a>-loving moocher who would &#34;gladly pay you Tuesday for a hamburger today&#34; (he was also soft-spoken and cowardly; <a href="" title="Vickers Wellington">Vickers Wellington</a> bombers were nicknamed &#34;Wimpys&#34; after the character); <a href="" title="George W. Geezil">George W. Geezil</a>, a local <a href="" title="shoemaking">cobbler</a> who spoke in a heavily affected accent and habitually attempted to murder or wish death upon Wimpy; and <a href="" title="Eugene the Jeep">Eugene the Jeep</a>, a yellow, vaguely dog-like animal from Africa with <a href="" title="magical">magical</a> powers. In addition, the strip featured the <a href="" title="Sea Hag">Sea Hag</a>, a terrible <a href="" title="pirate">pirate</a>, as well as the last <a href="" title="witch">witch</a> on earth (her even more terrible sister excepted); <a href="" title="Alice the Goon">Alice the Goon</a>, a monstrous creature who entered the strip as the Sea Hag&#39;s henchman and continued as Swee&#39;Pea&#39;s <a href="" title="babysitter">babysitter</a>; and Toar, a caveman.</p>
<p>Segar&#39;s strip was quite different from the cartoons that followed. The stories were more complex, with many characters that never appeared in the cartoons (King Blozo, for example). Spinach usage was rare and <a href="" title="Bluto">Bluto</a> made only one appearance. Segar would sign some of his early Popeye comic strips with a <a href="" title="cigar">cigar</a>, due to his last name being a <a href="" title="homophone">homophone</a> of &#34;cigar&#34; (pronounced SEE-gar).</p>
<p><i>Thimble Theatre</i> soon became one of King Features&#39; most popular strips during the 1930s and, following an eventual name change to <i>Popeye</i> in the 1970s, remains one of the longest running strips in syndication today. The strip carried on after Segar&#39;s death in 1938, at which point he was replaced by a series of artists. In the 1950s, a spinoff strip was established, called <i>Popeye the Sailorman</i>. Acknowledging Popeye&#39;s growing popularity, the <i>Thimble Theatre</i> strip was renamed <i>Thimble Theatre Starring Popeye</i> during the 1960s and 1970s, and was eventually retitled, simply <i>Popeye</i>, the name under which the strip continues to run.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Artists_after_Segar">Artists after Segar</span></h3>
<p>After Segar&#39;s death in 1938, many different artists were hired to draw the strip. <a href="" title="Tom Sims (artist)">Tom Sims</a>, the son of a <a href="" title="Coosa River">Coosa River</a> channel-boat captain, continued writing <i>Thimble Theatre</i> strips and established the <i>Popeye the Sailorman</i> spin-off.  <a href="" title="Doc Winner">Doc Winner</a> and <a href="" title="Bela Zaboly">Bela Zaboly</a>,&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; successively, handled the artwork during Sims&#39;s run. Eventually, Ralph Stein stepped in to write the strip until the series was taken over by <a href="" title="Bud Sagendorf">Bud Sagendorf</a> in 1959.</p>
<p>Sagendorf wrote and drew the daily strip until 1986, and continued to write and draw the <a href="" title="Sunday strip">Sunday strip</a> until his death in 1994. Sagendorf, who had been Segar&#39;s assistant, made a definite effort to retain much of Segar&#39;s classic style, although his art is instantly discernible. Sagendorf continued to use many obscure characters from the Segar years, especially O.G. Wotasnozzle and King Blozo. Sagendorf&#39;s new characters, such as the Thung, also had a very Segar-like quality. What set Sagendorf apart from Segar more than anything else was his sense of pacing. Where plotlines moved very quickly with Segar, it would sometimes take an entire week of Sagendorf&#39;s daily strips for the plot to be advanced even a small amount.</p>
<p>From 1986 to 1992, the daily strip was written and drawn by <a href="" title="Bobby London">Bobby London</a>, who, after some <a href="" title="controversy">controversy</a>, was fired from the strip for a story that could be taken to satirize <a href="" title="abortion">abortion</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.comic-art.com/intervws/london.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.comic-art.com/intervws/london.htm">comic-art.com</a>&#60;/ref&#62; London&#39;s strips put Popeye and his friends in updated situations, but kept the spirit of Segar&#39;s original. One classic storyline, titled &#34;The Return of Bluto&#34;, showed the sailor battling every version of the bearded bully from the comic strip, comic books, and animated films. The Sunday edition of the comic strip is currently drawn by <a href="" title="Hy Eisman">Hy Eisman</a>, who took over in 1994. The daily strip began featuring reruns of Sagendorf&#39;s strips after London was fired and continues to do so today.</p>
<p>On January 1, 2009, 70 years since the death of his creator, Segar&#39;s character of Popeye (though not the various films, TV shows, <a href="" title="theme music">theme music</a> and other media based on him) became <a href="" title="public domain">public domain</a>&#60;ref name=&#34;domain&#34;&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2009/01/12/publicdomain2.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2009/01/12/publicdomain2.html">CBC News, &#34;Popeye, Grey Owl and Robert Service join the public domain,&#34; January 12, 2009</a>&#60;/ref&#62; in most countries, but remains under <a href="" title="copyright">copyright</a> in the United States. Because Segar was an employee of King Features Syndicate when he created the Popeye character for the company&#39;s <i>Thimble Theatre</i> strip, Popeye is treated as a <a href="" title="work for hire">work for hire</a> under U.S. copyright law. Works for hire are protected for 95 years from publication or 120 years from creation, whichever is shorter.

<p>There have been a number of Popeye comic books, from <a href="" title="Dell (publisher)">Dell</a>, <a href="" title="King Comics">King Comics</a>, <a href="" title="Gold Key Comics">Gold Key Comics</a>, <a href="" title="Charlton Comics">Charlton Comics</a> and others, originally written and illustrated by <a href="" title="Bud Sagendorf">Bud Sagendorf</a>. In the Dell comics, Popeye became something like a freelance police assistant, fighting the <a href="" title="Mafia">Mafia</a> and Bluto&#39;s criminal activities. The new villains included the Ming dwarves, who were identical.</p>
<p>Popeye appeared in the British &#34;<a href="" title="TV Comic">TV Comic</a>&#34; series, a News of the World publication, becoming the cover story in 1960 with stories written and drawn by &#34;Chick&#34; Henderson. Bluto was referred to as Brutus and was Popeye&#39;s only nemesis throughout the entire run.</p>
<p>A variety of artists have created <i>Popeye</i> comic book stories since then; for example, <a href="" title="George Wildman">George Wildman</a> drew Popeye stories for Charlton Comics from 1969 until the late 1970s. The Gold Key series was illustrated by Wildman and scripted by <a href="" title="Bill Pearson (American writer)">Bill Pearson</a>, with some issues written by <a href="" title="Nick Cuti">Nick Cuti</a>.</p>
<p>In 1988, Ocean Comics released the <i>Popeye Special</i> written by <a href="" title="Ron Fortier">Ron Fortier</a> with art by <a href="" title="Ben Dunn">Ben Dunn</a>. The story presented Popeye&#39;s origin story and attempted to tell more of a lighthearted adventure story as opposed to using typical comic strip style humor. The story also featured a more realistic art style and was edited by Bill Pearson, who also lettered and inked the story as well as the front cover.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; A second issue, by the same creative team, followed in 1988. The second issue introduced the idea that Bluto and Brutus were actually twin brothers and not the same person.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; In 1999, to celebrate Popeye&#39;s 70th anniversary, Ocean Comics revisited the franchise with a one-shot comic book, entitled <i>The Wedding of Popeye and Olive Oyl</i>, written by <a href="" title="Peter David">Peter David</a>. The comic book brought together a large portion of the casts of both the comic strip and the animated shorts, and Popeye and Olive Oyl were finally wed after decades of courtship. However, this marriage has not been reflected in all media since the comic was published.</p>
<p>In 1989, a special series of short <i>Popeye</i> comic books were included in specially marked boxes of <a href="" title="Instant Quaker Oatmeal">Instant Quaker Oatmeal</a>, and Popeye also appeared in TV commercials for <a href="" title="Quaker Oatmeal">Quaker Oatmeal</a>, which featured a parrot delivering the tag line &#34;Popeye wants a Quaker!&#34; The plots were similar to those of the films: Popeye loses either Olive Oyl or Swee&#39;Pea to a muscle-bound antagonist, eats something invigorating, and proceeds to save the day. In this case, however, the invigorating elixir was not his usual spinach, but rather one of four flavors of Quaker Oatmeal. (A different flavor was showcased with each mini-comic.) The comics ended with the sailor saying, &#34;I&#39;m Popeye the Quaker Man!&#34;, which offended members of the <a href="" title="Religious Society of Friends">Religious Society of Friends</a> or <a href="" title="Quakers">Quakers</a>. Members of this religious group (which has no connection to the cereal company) are pacifists and do not believe in using <a href="" title="violence">violence</a> to resolve conflicts. For Popeye to call himself a &#34;Quaker man&#34; after beating up someone was offensive to the Quakers and considered a misrepresentation of their <a href="" title="faith">faith</a> and religious beliefs. After a brief protest, the Quaker Oatmeal Company pulled the comic books and commercials in 1990, and the promotional campaign remains little-known.</p>
<p>In 2012, writer <a href="" title="Roger Langridge">Roger Langridge</a> and cartoonist <a href="" title="Bruce Ozella">Bruce Ozella</a> teamed to revive the spirit of Segar in IDW&#39;s four-issue comic book miniseries, <i>Popeye</i>, with issues #1 and #4 by Ozella and issues #2 and #3 by Tom Neely. Critic PS Hayes reviewed:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>Langridge writes a story with a <i>lot</i> of dialogue (compared to your average comic book) and it’s all necessary, funny, and entertaining. Bruce Ozella draws the perfect Popeye. Not only Popeye, but Popeye’s whole world. Everything looks like it should, cartoony and goofy. Plus, he brings an unusual amount of detail to something that doesn’t really need it. You’ll swear that you’re looking at an old Whitman Comics issue of Popeye, only it’s better. Ozella is a great storyteller and even though the issue is jam packed with dialog, the panels never look cramped at all.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/04/25/comic-review-popeye-1/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.geeksofdoom.com/2012/04/25/comic-review-popeye-1/">&#34;Review: Popeye #1&#34;, Geeks of Doom, April 25, 2012.</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</dd></dl>

<div class="thumbcaption">Popeye, about to eat his spinach, in Fleischer Studios&#39; <i><a href="#1936" title="List of Popeye the Sailor theatrical cartoons (Fleischer Studios)">Little Swee&#39; Pea</a></i> (1936)</div>
In November 1932, King Features signed an agreement with <a href="" title="Fleischer Studios">Fleischer Studios</a> to have Popeye and the other <i>Thimble Theatre</i> characters begin appearing in a series of animated cartoons. The first cartoon in the series was released in 1933, and <i>Popeye</i> cartoons, released by <a href="" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>, would remain a staple of Paramount&#39;s release schedule for nearly 25 years. <a href="" title="William &amp;quot;Billy&amp;quot; Costello">William Costello</a> was the original voice of Popeye, a voice that would be replicated by later performers, such as <a href="" title="Jack Mercer">Jack Mercer</a> and even <a href="" title="Mae Questel">Mae Questel</a>. Many of the <i>Thimble Theatre</i> characters, including Wimpy, Poopdeck Pappy, and Eugene the Jeep, eventually made appearances in the Paramount cartoons, though appearances by Olive Oyl&#39;s extended family and Ham Gravy were notably absent. Thanks to the animated-short series, Popeye became even more of a sensation than he had been in comic strips, and by 1938, polls showed that the sailor was Hollywood&#39;s most popular cartoon character.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; </p>
<p>In every Popeye cartoon, the sailor is invariably put into what seems like a hopeless situation, upon which (usually after a beating), a can of spinach which he apparently regularly carries with him falls out from inside his shirt. Popeye immediately pops the can open and gulp the entire contents of it into his mouth, or sometimes sucks in the spinach through his corncob pipe. Upon swallowing the spinach, Popeye&#39;s physical strength immediately becomes almost superhuman, and he is easily able to save the day (and very often rescue Olive Oyl from a dire situation). It did not stop there, as spinach could also give Popeye the skills and powers he needed, like in <i><a href="" title="The Man on the Flying Trapeze">The Man on the Flying Trapeze</a></i>, where it gave him acrobatic skills.</p>
<p>In May 1941, Paramount Pictures assumed ownership of Fleischer Studios, fired the Fleischers and began reorganizing the studio, which they renamed <a href="" title="Famous Studios">Famous Studios</a>. The early Famous-era shorts were often World War II-themed, featuring Popeye fighting <a href="" title="Nazi Germany">Nazis</a> and <a href="" title="Imperial Japan">Japanese</a> soldiers, most notably the 1942 short <i><a href="" title="You&#39;re a Sap, Mr. Jap">You&#39;re a Sap, Mr. Jap</a></i>. In late 1943, the <i>Popeye</i> series was moved to Technicolor production, beginning with <i>Her Honor the Mare.</i> Famous/Paramount continued producing the <i>Popeye</i> series until 1957, with <i><a href="" title="Spooky Swabs">Spooky Swabs</a></i> being the last of the 125 Famous shorts in the series. Paramount then sold the <i>Popeye</i> film catalog to <a href="" title="Associated Artists Productions">Associated Artists Productions</a>, which was bought out by <a href="" title="United Artists">United Artists</a> in 1958 and later merged with <a href="" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</a>, which was itself purchased by <a href="" title="Turner Entertainment">Turner Entertainment</a> in 1986. Turner sold off the production end of MGM/UA shortly after, but retained the film catalog, giving it the rights to the theatrical <i>Popeye</i> library. The black-and-white <i>Popeye</i> shorts were shipped to South Korea in 1985, where artists retraced them into color. The retraced shorts were syndicated in 1987 on a barter basis, and remained available until the early 1990s. Turner merged with <a href="" title="Time Warner">Time Warner</a> in 1996, and <a href="" title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> (through its Turner subsidiary) therefore currently controls the rights to the <i>Popeye</i> shorts.</p>
<p>In 2001, the <a href="" title="Cartoon Network (United States)">Cartoon Network</a>, under the supervision of animation historian <a href="" title="Jerry Beck">Jerry Beck</a>, created a new incarnation of <i><a href="" title="The Popeye Show">The Popeye Show</a></i>. The show aired the Fleischer and Famous Studios <i>Popeye</i> shorts in versions approximating their original theatrical releases by editing copies of the original opening and closing credits (taken or recreated from various sources) onto the beginnings and ends of each cartoon, or in some cases, in their complete, uncut original theatrical versions direct from such prints that originally contained the front-and-end Paramount credits. The series aired 135 <i>Popeye</i> shorts over forty-five episodes, until March 2004. <i>The Popeye Show</i> continued to air on Cartoon Network&#39;s spin-off network <a href="" title="Boomerang (TV channel)">Boomerang</a>. </p>
<p>While many of the Paramount <i>Popeye</i> cartoons remained unavailable on video, a handful of those cartoons had fallen into <a href="" title="public domain">public domain</a> and were found on numerous low budget VHS tapes and later DVDs.  When Turner Entertainment acquired the cartoons in 1986, a long and laborious legal struggle with King Features kept the majority of the original Popeye shorts from official video releases for more than 20 years. King Features instead opted to release a DVD boxed set of the 1960s made-for-television <i><a href="" title="Popeye the Sailor (1960s TV series)">Popeye the Sailor</a></i> cartoons, which it retained the rights to, in 2004. In the meantime, home video rights to the Associated Artists Productions library were transferred from <a href="" title="CBS/Fox Video">CBS/Fox Video</a> to <a href="" title="MGM Home Entertainment">MGM/UA Home Video</a> in 1986, and eventually to <a href="" title="Warner Home Video">Warner Home Video</a> in 1999. In 2006, Warner Home Video announced it would release all of the <i>Popeye</i> cartoons produced for theatrical release between 1933 and 1957 on DVD, restored and uncut. Three volumes were released between 2007 and 2008, covering all of the Fleischer era and the beginnings of the Famous era.</p>

<p>In 1960, <a href="" title="King Features Syndicate">King Features Syndicate</a> commissioned a new series of cartoons entitled <i><a href="" title="Popeye the Sailor (1960s TV series)">Popeye the Sailor</a></i>, but this time for television syndication. <a href="" title="Al Brodax">Al Brodax</a> served as executive producer of the cartoons for King Features. <a href="" title="Jack Mercer">Jack Mercer</a>, <a href="" title="Mae Questel">Mae Questel</a>, and <a href="" title="Jackson Beck">Jackson Beck</a> returned for this series, which was produced by a number of companies, including <a href="" title="Jack Kinney">Jack Kinney Productions</a>, <b>Rembrandt Films</b> (<a href="" title="William L.

The artwork was streamlined and simplified for the television budgets, and 220 cartoons were produced in only two years, with the first set of them premiering in the autumn of 1960, and the last of them debuting during the 1961–1962 television season. Since King Features had exclusive rights to these <i>Popeye</i> cartoons, 85 of them were released on DVD as a 75th anniversary <i>Popeye</i> boxed set in 2004.</p>
<p>For these cartoons, Bluto&#39;s name was changed to &#34;Brutus,&#34; as King Features believed at the time that Paramount owned the rights to the name &#34;Bluto.&#34; Many of the cartoons made by Paramount used plots and storylines taken directly from the comic strip sequences-as well as characters like King Blozo and the Sea Hag.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; The 1960s cartoons have been issued on both VHS and DVD.</p>
<p>On September 9, 1978, <i><a href="" title="The All-New Popeye Hour">The All-New Popeye Hour</a></i> debuted on the <a href="" title="CBS">CBS</a> Saturday morning lineup. It was an hour-long animated series produced by <a href="" title="Hanna-Barbera Productions">Hanna-Barbera Productions</a>, which tried its best to retain the style of the original comic strip (Popeye returned to his original costume and Brutus to his original name of Bluto), while complying with the prevailing content restrictions on violence. In addition to providing many of the cartoon scripts, Mercer continued to voice Popeye, while <a href="" title="Marilyn Schreffler">Marilyn Schreffler</a> and <a href="" title="Allan Melvin">Allan Melvin</a> became the new voices of Olive Oyl and Bluto, respectively. (Mae Questel actually auditioned for Hanna-Barbera to recreate Olive Oyl, but was rejected in favor of Schreffler.) <i>The All-New Popeye Hour</i> ran on CBS until September 1981, when it was cut to a half-hour and retitled <i>The Popeye and Olive Show</i>. It was removed from the CBS lineup in September 1983, the year before Jack Mercer&#39;s death. These cartoons have also been released on VHS and DVD. During the time these cartoons were in production, CBS aired <i>The Popeye Valentine&#39;s Day Special – Sweethearts at Sea</i> on February 14, 1979. In the UK, the BBC aired a half-hour version of <i>The All-New Popeye Show</i>, from the early-1980s to 2004.</p>
<p>Popeye briefly returned to CBS in 1987 for <i><a href="" title="Popeye and Son">Popeye and Son</a></i>, another <a href="" title="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> series, which featured Popeye and Olive as a married couple with a son named Popeye Jr., who hates the taste of spinach but eats it to boost his strength. <a href="" title="Maurice LaMarche">Maurice LaMarche</a> performed Popeye&#39;s voice; Mercer had died in 1984.

Its style was influenced by the 1930s Fleischer cartoons, and featured Swee&#39;Pea, Wimpy, Bluto (who is Popeye&#39;s friend in this version), Olive Oyl, Poopdeck Pappy and the Sea Hag as its characters. On November 6, 2007, Lionsgate Entertainment re-released <i>Popeye’s Voyage</i> on DVD with redesigned cover art.</p>
<p>Popeye has made brief parody appearances in modern animated productions, including:

<p>The 1988 Disney film <i><a href="" title="Who Framed Roger Rabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></i> featured many classic cartoon characters, and the absence of Popeye was noted by some critics. Popeye (along with Bluto and Olive Oyl) actually had a role planned for the film. However since the Popeye cartoons were based on a comic book series, Disney found they had to pay licensing fees to both King Features Syndicate and MGM/UA.  MGM/UA&#39;s pre-1986 library (which included Popeye) was being purchased by Turner Entertainment at the time, which created legal complications; thus, the rights could not be obtained and Popeye&#39;s cameo was dropped from the film.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>

In addition to Allen Canning&#39;s Popeye spinach, Popeye Fresh Foods markets bagged, fresh spinach with Popeye characters on the package. In 2006, when spinach contaminated with <i><a href="" title="E. coli">E. coli</a></i> was <a href="" title="2006 North American E. coli outbreak">accidentally sold to the public</a>, many editorial cartoonists lampooned the affair by featuring Popeye in their cartoons.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>A frequently circulated story claims that Fleischer&#39;s choice of spinach to give Popeye strength was based on faulty calculations of its iron content. In the story, a scientist misplaced a decimal point in an 1870 measurement of spinach&#39;s iron content, leading to an iron value ten times higher than it should have been. This faulty measurement was not noticed until the 1930s.&#60;ref&#62;Hamblin, T.J.(1981) <a class="externallink" href="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pdf_extract/283/6307/1671" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bmj.com/cgi/pdf_extract/283/6307/1671">Fake!</a> <i>British Medical Journal</i> Vol. 283.19–26 December. pp.1671-1674&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; While this story has gone through longstanding circulation, recent study has shown that this is a myth,&#60;ref&#62; <a class="externallink" href="http://arbesman.net/files/2012/09/Arbesman_Half-Life-Errata.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://arbesman.net/files/2012/09/Arbesman_Half-Life-Errata.pdf">http://arbesman.net/files/2012/09/Arbesman_Half-Life-Errata.pdf</a> &#60;/ref&#62; and it was chosen for its <a href="" title="vitamin A">vitamin A</a> content alone;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/09/opinion-errors-knowledge-crowdfixing/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/09/opinion-errors-knowledge-crowdfixing/">http://www.wired.com/wiredscience/2012/09/opinion-errors-knowledge-crowdfixing/</a> &#60;/ref&#62; see <a href="#In_popular_culture" title="Spinach">Spinach: Popeye and iron</a>.</p>

<p>The strip is also responsible for popularizing, although not inventing, the word &#34;<a href="" title="goon">goon</a>&#34; (meaning a thug or lackey); goons in Popeye&#39;s world were large humanoids with indistinctly drawn faces that were particularly known for being used as muscle and slave labor by Popeye&#39;s nemesis, the <a href="" title="Sea Hag">Sea Hag</a>.
