Those involved in voting it through were Cool Hand Luke, Coren, FloNight, John Vandenberg, Kirill Lokshin, Rlevse, Roger Davies, and Wizardman. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Noticeboard&#38;oldid=301532521#Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development_convened" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Noticeboard&#38;oldid=301532521#Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development_convened"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Noticeboard&#38;oldid=301532521#Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development_convened" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Noticeboard&#38;oldid=301532521#Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development_convened">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Noticeboard&#38;oldid=301532521#Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development_convened</a></a> Previous discussion <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee/Noticeboard#Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development_convened" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Arbitration_Committee/Noticeboard#Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development_convened">here</a>.</p>
<p>The advisory council describes itself as &#34;an advisory body to the Arbitration Committee and to the community. It considers various issues facing the project and develops ideas, proposals, and recommendations for improving it; and serves as a forum for the sharing of best practices among the different areas within the project.&#34; <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development&#38;oldid=301548621" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development&#38;oldid=301548621"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development&#38;oldid=301548621" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development&#38;oldid=301548621">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development&#38;oldid=301548621</a></a></p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_SlimVirgin">Statement by SlimVirgin</span></h2>

<p>My concern about this committee is that it&#39;s an example of the Arbitration Committee overreaching itself. The ArbCom is a dispute-resolution body. It does not lead Wikipedia, and I believe the overwhelming majority of Wikipedians do not want to be led by it. Indeed, one of the key points of the last ArbCom election is that voters wanted to see an end to the Committee assuming too much authority. It has the right to request advice from anyone as it sees fit, but it should be done informally. The formal creation of such a far-reaching Advisory Council needs community-wide input before being established, and its membership ought to be elected. As such, the current Council ought to be abandoned, and the matter opened up for community debate. &#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a>&#60;/font&#62; &#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:SlimVirgin|talk">SlimVirgin|talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;pink&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/SlimVirgin">contribs</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 17:00, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>Agree with SlimVirgin (no, really) – this looks like a step backwards whichever way one looks at it. If it works, it&#39;s an unaccountable, unelected Wikipedia version of the <a href="" title="House of Lords">House of Lords</a>; if it doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s a powerless talking-shop which is going to end up syphoning off the time of some of our most productive writers. Either way, it represents a power grab by Arbcom into the field of general content guidelines, which up to now have been determined by the community, not by a Wikimedia Congress of Workers&#39; and Peasants&#39; Deputies.&#38;nbsp;–&#38;nbsp;&#60;font color=&#34;#E45E05&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Iridescent">iride</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#C1118C&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Iridescent">scent</a>&#60;/font&#62; 17:12, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Exactly. ArbCom is not a policy-making body and therefore has no need for a think-tank. --<a href="" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Philcha">talk</a>) 17:22, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agree. Such a body should be independent and certainly Arbcom members should not be able to vote themselves into such a position. I see the time approaching when the community sets some limits on the power of the Arbcom that serves it. –  &#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Bradley Hand ITC; font-size:15px;&#34;&#62;<b><a href="" title="User talk:Toon05">Toon</a></b>&#60;/span&#62; 17:30, 11 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>&#60;s&#62;Agree generally, from what I&#39;ve seen (I&#39;d say it looks more like the kind of House of Lords Labour would like than the current mix). Invite only is a huge problem. I should add I hugely respect several of those editors, though I&#39;m surprised by one, and I&#39;m willing to be convinced this is a &#34;good thing&#34;. I thought it best to give my initial comments before looking at the membership so not to be swayed. If membership is opened, but with an admin type level (officer branch), it would seem better. &#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Papyrus&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Verbal">&#60;b style=&#34;color:#C72&#34;&#62;Verbal&#60;/b&#62;</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="#Top" title="User talk:Verbal">&#60;span style=&#34;color:Gray;&#34;&#62;chat&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/span&#62; 17:31, 11 July 2009 (UTC)&#60;/s&#62; </dd></dl></li>
<li>Agree. Exclusive clubs, even when appointed by AC, go against the spirit of WP. We are all volunteers here, we all donate our time, we all deserve an equal chance, equal input and equal vote. <a href="" title="User:Crum375">Crum375</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Crum375">talk</a>) 17:34, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree. The Arbitration Committee surely has the right to seek advice from any Wikipedians it wishes - subject only to Foundation policy and the community&#39;s ability to shape the Committee. The committee does not have the right to establish a privileged and elevated body of formal advisors without community approval. &#60;span  style=&#34;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;— <a href="" title="User:Gavia immer">Gavia immer</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gavia immer">talk</a>)&#60;/span&#62; 17:48, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Per Iridescent and Philcha. The current system may be broken in some people&#39;s eyes, but if you want a committee to help lead policy development, then get a consensus among the community for that. This advisory council is not authorized by the ArbCom&#39;s original remit, and so must be further authorized by the community. &#60;font color=&#34;navy&#34;&#62;<b><a href="" title="User:NuclearWarfare">NW</a>&#60;/font&#62;</b> <i>(&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:NuclearWarfare">Talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;)</i> 17:58, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>ArbCom&#39;s role is dispute resolution. It is elected to that role by the community. The Advisory Council is not elected, and should have no special role in dispute resolution. If ArbCom wants power beyond dispute resolution, it should talk to the community. If a group like this is to be set up, there&#39;s no reason it should be under the aegis of ArbCom, nor any reason why it should be appointed by them. --<a href="" title="User:MoreThings">MoreThings</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:MoreThings">talk</a>) 18:05, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>In theory I probably like the idea of a group like this, and I have great respect for a number of the editors who have been &#34;invited,&#34; but, my god, what a horrible way to implement it. The reaction already being expressed here should have been entirely predictable since this is not the kind of thing that ArbCom, Jimbo, and a few select editors can set up without expecting a backlash from the community for lack of consultation. I think we would likely see pretty strong support for something along these lines, but SV is absolutely right that it &#34;needs community-wide input before being established.&#34; I&#39;ll admit to being a bit flummoxed as to how the smart folks who put this together could possibly have thought otherwise. --<a href="" title="User:Bigtimepeace">Bigtimepeace</a> &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User_talk:Bigtimepeace">talk</a> |  <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Bigtimepeace">contribs</a>&#60;/small&#62; 18:27, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think that without the affirmation of the community as a whole, there will be little faith, and no teeth in anything that this group would try to undertake. — &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #000000;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;&#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:Ched Davis">Ched</a>&#60;/b&#62; : <a href="" title="User_talk:Ched Davis">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#FFFFFF;background:#0000fa;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;?&#38;nbsp;&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 18:35, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree. Nothing wrong with the core idea, but there should have been more transparency in the formation of the group, and the community should have been given a chance to opine on this. This smells strongly of the &#34;Established Editors&#34;, which collapsed spectacularly from community backlash. I think that ArbCom is overstepping the their authority. Any &#34;think tank&#34; should be agreed on, developed, and authorized by the community. Also agree with comments by Iridescent and Philcha. <a href="" title="User:Dabomb87">Dabomb87</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dabomb87">talk</a>) 18:45, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>This looks like an attempt to build a bureaucratic governance structure from the top without any discussion, in a community that has always insisted on discussing everything while resisting both bureaucracy and doing things from the top. In other words, a non-starter and an amazingly bad idea that should be abandoned post-haste. &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Sandstein">&#60;font style=&#34;color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;&#34;&#62;<b>&#38;nbsp;Sandstein&#38;nbsp;</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 18:48, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>There is a designated channel for policy and infrastructure suggestions already, which all editors can use - <a href="" title="WP:VP">the village pump</a>.  Admittedly, <a href="" title="WP:VP">WP:VP</a> might not work as well as it ought - but it would be better to explore reforming and streamlining <a href="" title="WP:VP">WP:VP</a>, rather than rely on small advisory groups which the community may not feel representative without electoral input. <a href="" title="User:Knepflerle">Knepflerle</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Knepflerle">talk</a>) 19:24, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>What purpose does this serve which an open (i.e. not self-selecting) wikiproject (like, say, the sadly-stalled  <a href="" title="WP:PROJPOL">WP:PROJPOL</a>) wouldn&#39;t? And how does this not violate <a href="" title="WP:CABAL">WP:CABAL</a>? Just wrong, so very wrong.

<li>If Arbcom wants an Advisory Council, presenting a fait accompli with appointments made behind closed doors not the way to go about it. Discussion of the role and membership of such a body should take place on-wiki before it is created. Separation of powers is an important principle. For instance, if this Request for Comment proves inconclusive, where can we now go for independent arbitration? It shows incredible ill-judgement that ArbCom appears not to have appreciated this issue. <i><a href="" title="User talk:Geometry guy">Geometry guy</a></i> 21:13, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Strongly agree</b>.  <a href="" title="WP:NOT">Wikipedia is not a bureaucracy</a>, ArbCom has no permission from the &#34;governed&#34; to expand their role from that of a judiciary to that of an executive, nor do they have permission to set up a leislature.  <a href="" title="User:Who then was a gentleman?">Who then was a gentleman?</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Who then was a gentleman?">talk</a>) 21:14, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

We elected the arbs to, you know, arbitrate and some seem to have forgotten that or, perhaps, never understood what it means. When I was deciding how to vote, I was considering the candidate&#39;s dispute resolution skills, not their ability to govern this project. These are different skill sets and I&#39;m sure the community would have elected different people if we thought we were electing governors, politicians or anything other than arbitrators. Meanwhile, we still have arb cases sitting around for months and frighteningly broad fishing net remedies. I&#39;ve never been particularly critical of the ArbCom in the past but I&#39;ve rapidly become one of your fiercest critics. Please either do what you were elected to do (dispute resolution) and if you&#39;re more interested in politics and governance, by all means, pursue as a member of this community, and don&#39;t try to shoehorn ArbCom into some kind of governance body. <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 00:56, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed, if Wikipedia does need a group like this, it should be developed from the community and open to elections, and not by invitation only.  However I am also saddened that two arbitrators involved in this seem to feel this is worth resigning over.  I ask those that two arbitrators reconsider, and don&#39;t consider the rejection of this proposal to be equated with a rejection of them as people or of their work as arbitrators.

<dd><b>General comment</b>: I am one of the arbitrators who voted for the advisory council. I did not so do because I wished to create a structure of governance under ArbCom control (I don&#39;t). I supported because there is an aching void in Wikipedia for a forum for brainstorming and reflective discussion that is not crisis-driven and is not within the polarised crucible of support/oppose discussions. The easiest way to achieve this is to set up a group, with no powers whatsover, drawn widely, and leave it to go its own way and find its own directions. Any proposals would either sink or swim on their individual merits in community discusion. This is entirely consistent with the principle of boldness that informs Wiki evolution. Of course, other ways exist to set this up, and we might if we tried find as many counter-proposals here as there are days in the year, but that does not mean either the idea of the council or the approach is a bad one and it certainly does not justify either all the criticisms or all the mischaracterisations expressed here. &#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Roger Davies">&#60;span style=&#34;color:maroon; font-variant:small-caps&#34;&#62;<b>Roger&#38;nbsp;Davies</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Roger Davies"><b>talk</b></a>&#60;/sup&#62; 08:00, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></li>

<li><b>Absolutely agree</b> There are precious few governments in the world where leaders or leadership/enforcement bodies enjoy the latitude to decide for themselves what will be the scope of their authority, how they will exercise it, and when. These forms of government have historically proven to be exceedingly unpopular with their citizens.

<li><b>Strongly Agree</b>  The Advisory Council is already violating its statement of purpose.  Members are supposed to be “not otherwise involved in its (Arbcom’s) work”, yet there are members of ArbCom on the Advisory Council.  In effect the Advisory Council ends up looking like an attempt by ArbCom to add additional non-elected members to ArbCom.  Looking at  <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Self electing groups">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Self electing groups</a>, I fully agree with the statement  “Any group of editors on Wikipedia that elects its own membership and has its own goals and objectives is fundementally against the open and collaborative spirit of Wikipedia, and is contrary to our <a href="" title="WP:5P">five pillars</a>, most importantly, <a href="#Community" title="Wikipedia:What_Wikipedia_is_not">what the Wikipedia community is not</a>.”   Members of the Advisory Committee should be familiar with that discussion, nearly 1/3 of them participated, with some saying they opposed self-elected groups.  <a href="" title="User:Edward321">Edward321</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Edward321">talk</a>) 19:33, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

Second, how does a body of appointed members spring forth cut from whole cloth? (And why wasn&#39;t I included, that would solve the problem ;) Third, this is doomed to failure, after the first two or three times this earnest body produces its recommendations and finds them ignored, the members will drift away with just a little more bitterness because &#34;they didn&#39;t listen to us!&#34;.

<li>Per <a href="#Statement_by_Jennavecia" title="" /> below, apparently most of the people who are supporting this are ... the people who were selected and the people who selected them.  Hm.  I think the comment above about separation of powers is on the money; to the extent that ArbCom has power and influence, they can only share some of their own, not create new institutions.  Although I don&#39;t pay close attention to ArbCom, they generally seem like reasonable people doing a hard job to me, and if they want to appoint any group to assist them in any way, they should go right ahead.  But respect is earned, not bestowed. &#60;s&#62;appointed  ... so let&#39;s see if they&#39;ve got the right stuff.&#60;/s&#62;  One clear downside: the precedent of forming a committee of Really Smart People We Trust A Lot is terrible; if this committee works out, we&#39;ll get an endless parade of New Committees That Are So Much Smarter Than You. - Dank (<a href="" title="User talk:Dank">push to talk</a>) 01:24, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>Add me to the list of people disenchanted with Wikipedia governance.  Like many others, I am in favour of a non-consensus based construct as a leadership entity, but I disagree with the process in constructing the Advisory Council as part of this entity -- and specifically with the decision made by the current ArbCom to delegate themselves as a governing body of sorts.  That being said, I would be in favour of the current &#34;Council&#34; membership staying as an <i>ad hoc</i> group for the purposes of brainstorming a different model of governance (as they appear to be a particularly dedicated group with a broad range of interests on Wikipedia), with the understanding that they are reporting to the community and not to ArbCom -- <a href="" title="User:Samir">Samir</a> 06:09, 20 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>I do think that the ArbCom should not be a governing body so much as it should be the final step of dispute resolution, so the creation of this committee ultimately stretches the level of authority they perceive themselves as having over the community. But it&#39;s everybody&#39;s fault in such instances, because we all need to step up and decide together what we need to do to make a better Wikipedia. And my signing does not reflect on my overall positive opinion of this year&#39;s arbitrators, who I think are doing a great job at resolving some of Wikipedia&#39;s most turbulent issues. <a href="" title="User:Master&amp;amp;amp;Expert"><b>&#60;span style=&#34;color:Blue&#34;&#62;Master&#38;amp;&#60;/span&#62;</b>&#60;span style=&#34;color:#00FFFF&#34;&#62;Expert&#60;/span&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Master&amp;amp;amp;Expert">&#60;span style=&#34;color:purple&#34;&#62;Talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>) 07:21, 27 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Endorse</b> This &#39;model of ineffectual anarchy&#39;--as one editor has described Wikipedia--has created the greatest source of (mostly accurate) information the world has ever seen. The number of editors has leveled off, but that&#39;s to be expected. Only a small percentage of internet users will be interested in actively contributing, but the number of readers is growing, and the number of articles is growing. I too have felt overwhelmed by the argumentative nature of discussions on various artilces&#39; talk pages (e.g. <a href="" title="Talk:Anarchism">Talk:Anarchism</a>), but this process more or less works. Its failings are standard human failings that we all need to learn to live with. The failings of a Committee-ocracy will be those same failings, except amplified by the <a href="" title="founder effect">founder effect</a>.

<li>One of the main reasons for pursuing this at this juncture was the concern that building it from the ground up would lead to endless discussions before any group actually materialised. The group is not a negative and does not influence the editing community in any way. I might not be as dramatic as root but I do see concerns (for example) in the falling off of new editors joining the project, plus BLP concerns that might have considerable short- and long-term implications for the project and warrant some form of discussion and investigation. Presuming some organized review occurs for these in the next six months, is anyone <i>really</i> thinking these are a net negative and should be discounted or erased?

<li>Per Root, Cas and Eric. As a note, apparently there has been edit warring over removal of opposings. Strongly suggest that not continue (because it&#39;s petty, and because it can be circumvented by someone creating a &#34;statement&#34; that says &#34;I oppose the statement by person X&#34;, which people can then &#34;support&#34;... that&#39;s just busywork but has exactly the same effect). ++<a href="" title="User:Lar">Lar</a>: <a href="" title="User_talk:Lar">t</a>/<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Lar">c</a> 15:10, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>The short statement of opposition to this idea (which, by the by, contains considerably less evidence of forethought and effort than the proposal itself) boils down to: <i>They didn&#39;t ask us, and we didn&#39;t get a chance to vote on who gets in.</i> What seems to have been misunderstood, though, is that no action is proposed to follow directly from any advice issued by this group - whether this advice is directed at ArbCom or the community. It isn&#39;t intended to make sweeping changes by fiat, only to come up with ideas to some of our problems that have the imprimatur of a diverse and well respected group of people before they can be shot down by the wider community. For a council that is designed to do nothing but discuss, it&#39;s certainly drawn a lot of fire on relatively weak grounds - it makes me wonder if there aren&#39;t more significant motives in opposition that just haven&#39;t been expressed. <a href="" title="User:Nathan">&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#0033CC&#34;&#62;Nathan&#60;/strong&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Nathan">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#0033CC&#34;&#62;  T  &#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 18:19, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>No. A community derived advisory council is an excellent idea, but it&#39;s composition, agenda, and <i>raison d&#39;etre</i> will likely be very different from this one. The &#34;problem&#34; with the community derived agenda is that it reflects the status quo, and is extremely unlikely to contribute anything radical or even vaguely slightly different than that which exists. The group assembled will likely generate a lot of different ideas, and some of them may bear further investigation and discussion. There is neither any reason why any (um, most, in fairness) interest group shouldn&#39;t form an advisory group and ArbCom is just one of them. The only problem I would have would be if some such group existed outside of wiki space, but exerted influence without accountability - something I do not see as happening here. <a href="" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:LessHeard vanU">talk</a>) 21:06, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>wouldn&#39;t the same positive effect be accomplished by encouraging editors to form voluntaristic &#34;councils&#34; to discuss different issues and to generate proposals for new policies or guidelines?  Sure, some such councils will as you suggest simply endorse mechanisms that you think are failing. But others would not.  The openness is the genious of Wikipedia.  Let people form as many councils as they like, and let anyone join any council, and <i>some</i> of them will come up with brilliant ideas, much better than any committee by design will.

<li>The founding of the council is legitimate, this RFC is iligitimate. It is not for the mob to interpet the law to suit their personal wants of the moment. The Arbcom should issue a unanimous statement of support and until the next Arbcom elections,in December, the comminity has no option but to put up and shut up. The community elected the Arbcom  to make decisions on their behalf. If they did not like it then the December ArbCom elections are the time to make that known. As a result of this maliciously brought RFC, in future, everytime some agitant does not like an ArbCom or wishes to seek revenge through disruption they will launch a similar RFC or something similar. The mob canot determine law contrary to the law or there is anarchy. December is the time to challenge this legitamately founded council. The community may discuss changes to constitution and policy, as I strongly advocate, but to challenge a sitting ArbCom&#39;s authority, no. <a href="" title="User:GiacomoReturned">Giano</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:GiacomoReturned">talk</a>) 22:53, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<p>I&#39;m further concerned that even if people find a need to have such a body, the &#34;invitation-only&#34; nature of it amounts to a self-sorting selection that will take certain points of view and make them take importance beyond their prominence. The first thing I noted was the presence of both Casliber and DGG both on the council, with no one that I would classify as an ardent exclusionist to balance their extreme inclusionist views. I could be comfortable with that if I felt that these issues would never come before this council, but I can&#39;t find a specific charter that lets me believe that is true. It isn&#39;t just inclusionism/exclusionism either: it&#39;s highly unlikely that anyone that strongly disagrees with members of this council on any topic will ever be invited to join the council.&#38;mdash;<a href="" title="User:Kww">Kww</a>(<a href="" title="User talk:Kww">talk</a>) 17:36, 11 July 2009 (UTC)

I trust both DGG and Cas to moderate their views on inclusion and be very self aware about it, just as I trust implicitly their ability to understand that they may be on one side of the average.

<li>Yes. I think the key to anything like this is the membership need to be elected by the community not appointed from on high. The idea that a small group of people would privately conceive the group, then select and appoint the membership of this group, without so much as a word of discussion with the community, is counter to Wikipedia culture and I&#39;m really astounded they thought they could pull this off without a big stink from the community (and slightly impressed by the sheer <a href="" title="Chutzpah">Chutzpah</a>). <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 01:30, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

To be frankly honest, ArbCom is struggling at the present to maintain the confidence and support of the wider Wiki community due to some recent decisions which show a lack of due consideration and consistency, exudes far too much confidence in its own abilities when seriously questioned, and doesn&#39;t at this stage have in my view the moral authority to impose solutions on problems it doesn&#39;t understand. <a href="" title="User talk:Orderinchaos">Orderinchaos</a> 01:44, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think it&#39;s impossible to ever build a sufficiently balanced standing committee that is balanced on all things for all people. I don&#39;t have any objections to the idea of Arbcom building ad-hoc committees to study various issues, my objection is to a perpetual committee that grows only by its own choice. The committee that is balanced over BLP practices may not be balanced over issues of non-free content, and neither of those may be balanced over notability issues. As Kirill said, no one can keep arbcom from asking advice. All I ask is that they examine the issue before them, and make a specific decision about who to gain advice from on each topic.—<a href="" title="User:Kww">Kww</a>(<a href="" title="User talk:Kww">talk</a>) 04:18, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_User:Moni3">Statement by User:Moni3</span></h2>
<p>I believe the confusion, questions, and negativity that are spawning from this is borne from lack of clarity and scope. I believe there is value in this idea, but without defined parameters regarding its purpose, how its run, its effects, and its reception, it logically leads to this RfC. The ArbCom Noticeboard announcement may have been premature until these issues are clarified, either by whoever proposed it, or the members who have accepted their invitations. --<a href="" title="User:Moni3">Moni3</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Moni3">talk</a>) 17:37, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<ol>
<li>Agree. When I first saw this proposal, my thought was that Arbcom had put the cart well before the horse. They&#39;ve decided to establish a formal bureaucratic group, but they haven&#39;t quite worked out what it&#39;s going to <i>do</i> yet. Apparently it was just very important to have such a tranche of Arbcom-approved people around in case they should be needed. If there is an actual specific purpose to be accomplished here, Arbcom could answer many objections by stating it plainly; if not, well, we generally don&#39;t do privilege for its own sake. &#60;span  style=&#34;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;— <a href="" title="User:Gavia immer">Gavia immer</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gavia immer">talk</a>)&#60;/span&#62; 18:02, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>I agree. It&#39;s too vague and I&#39;m not sure those appointed to it can have been entirely certain about what it will do. I can see the need for a sort of &#39;think tank&#39; with no executive powers, separate from Arbcom, and only Arbcom could possibly have the ability to create it, but I think the priority in setting it up is to settle on its role and duties before naming the members. <a href="" title="User:Sam Blacketer">Sam Blacketer</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Sam Blacketer">talk</a>) 23:08, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Apologies, I wasn&#39;t referring to you personally (or even current members of the group, necessarily). To clarify: Agree with your statement that negativity spawning from this is borne from the lack of clarity, scope and defined parameters regarding its purpose. Further comment: One of the reasons those things are required is that, without those things, the group as a whole or individuals within it will end up defining their own remit; with results ranging from ineffectiveness to megalomania (although &#34;doing an amazing job&#34; would also be a possibility in that range). <a href="" title="User:Ha!">Ha!</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ha!">talk</a>) 14:15, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></li>
<li>Endorse. The idea of such a committee has merit, and it could be seen as logically making sense that the people who would be involved in its creation might be the ArbCom. But I do think that it might have been better if there had been a bit more public discussion before the fact.

<p>This project is nothing if not broken, and there&#39;s no improvement in sight. This seems like a good opportunity for focused discussion by established editors with different focuses and experiences on the project. The possibility to see some viable proposals for change to then present to the community seems like something worth going for. What&#39;s the worst that can happen? Great ideas get presented to the community and shot-down in no consensus? Well, that&#39;s the best we can achieve right now, so we might as well hope for the best and see how it goes. <a href="" title="User:Jennavecia">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Lucida Handwriting;color:#9B30FF&#34;&#62;<b>ل</b>enna&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Jennavecia">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Lucida Handwriting;color:#63B8FF&#34;&#62;vecia&#60;/span&#62;</a> 19:00, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>&#39;Established editors&#39; went down in flames but there could surely be a way of allowing &#39;the community&#39; to choose such a group.  For example, a process of selection of suitable candidates by a smaller group who would then make recommendations for community approval.

<ol>
<li>I don&#39;t think it was necessarily a good idea to add &#34;oppose&#34; comments on this RfC, but clearly that is going on, and as such I&#39;m going to add one here, for a very specific reason (though I do disagree with Jennavecia&#39;s statement pretty much in full). A number of proponents of the &#34;council&#34; have said (repeatedly, on multiple pages) that much of the opposition to this come from editors with a grudge against ArbCom, or from people who are green with envy over not being named to the committee, or both. I find that to be highly inappropriate - and extremely unhelpful - for <a href="" title="WP:AGF">obvious reasons</a>. I&#39;m sure all the above endorsements to Jennavecia&#39;s statement were added very much in good faith, and I respect this particular viewpoint even though I disagree with it. As we evaluate this RfC, however, it&#39;s worth pointing out what could be construed as a conflict of interest for some of the above supporters of Jenna&#39;s statement. By my count seven of those supporting are themselves on the committee, and thus it essentially goes without saying that they support the group (in a sense I think this is somewhat, but not fully, akin to voting &#34;support&#34; in one&#39;s own RfA). Similarly two arbitrators who supported the initial proposal have supported this statement. So as of now, LessHeard having recorded the most recent support as I write this, exactly 25% of those supporting Jenna&#39;s statement (including Jenna herself) either created the committee or are serving on it. Of course they have every right to comment here, and as I said I&#39;m utterly convinced that they are doing so in good faith, but the fact that they are actually members or instigators of the group under discussion should be considered when thinking about the consensus on this RfC. --<a href="" title="User:Bigtimepeace">Bigtimepeace</a> &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User_talk:Bigtimepeace">talk</a> |  <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Bigtimepeace">contribs</a>&#60;/small&#62; 21:54, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Disagree</b> I have been here a long time and I do not see any basis for claims that the project is broken.  if the project is broken, it was broken when it ws first founded, because i have not seen any problem here that was not here in 2001, when i joined (there is really only one problem here, and JHK summed it up when she quit <i>in August <b>2002!!!</b></i><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK</a></a>.)  Wikipedia has not yet attracted a large and diverse enough group of experts; many editors are not very good at research; we attract trolls.  All of this was true eight years ago.  You wanna know what?  The problem is not that Wikipedia is broken, the problem is that it is working.  When you create an encyclopedia &#34;that anyone can edit at any time&#34; you will attract vandals and trolls and POV pushers, and we just have to trust in the community itself to undo the damage caused by them.  When the encyclopedia is on the web, it is, at least at first, going to attract a disproportionate number of geeks, computer-science experts, and then physical and life sciences experts... this disproportionate expertese leads to uneven coverage of topics.  But frankly, as we have grown we have gotten better.  This encyclopedia has an excellent article on evolution, on race, on Jesus - three controversial topics, yet three relatively stable and highly informative articles.  I do not see how the encyclopedia is broken.  I do see some troubling matters - concerns of ArbCom abusing authority, concerns bout some editors wishing to create unnecessary hierarchies.  dedicated members can thwart most of this.  Anyway, no one has yet convinced me that Wikipedia has any problem that it did not have when it was formed, or that any problem is worse now than when it was formed. <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 00:34, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Agree to disagree</b> I agree with Slrubensteins rationale for disagreeing. The only thing that seems to be broken is some wikipedians&#39; spirits, which now cause them to look for authoritarian ways of making the project more easily malleabel to their ideas of what a prject should look like.

<li><b>Disagree</b> As Slrubenstein says, the project is not broken. There are issues, there are problems, and some of them are significant, but by-and-large they are being solved. And not by Arbcom either. The problems we face are being solved by the editors in the trenches doing the actual work. Mostly we get by because <i>on the whole</i> there are more reasonable editors dedicated to the project and its principals than there are retards, assholes and trolls. Mostly. <a href="" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc</a> &#60;font color =&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Tropics</a>&#60;/font &#62; 04:08, 19 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Disagree</b> The project is not broken by any stretch - large sections of it work just fine. I don&#39;t think an &#34;advisory council&#34; composed of Wikipedians can achieve anything meaningful - our definition of &#34;expert&#34; is a bit distorted by our lack of them. And I think the present ArbCom and its mix of intransigence and incompetence (which I note is not universal to its members, but doesn&#39;t have to be given majority rules) is doing more to &#34;break&#34; Wikipedia than many of the other problems we face, and it trying to extend its wings further would be a disaster. <a href="" title="User talk:Orderinchaos">Orderinchaos</a> 07:04, 19 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ol>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_Iridescent">Statement by Iridescent</span></h2>
<p>The statement that &#34;The Advisory Council also advises the Committee directly, providing it with feedback and ideas from a cross-section of the community that&#39;s not otherwise involved in its work&#34;, quite aside from the hypocrisy of &#34;not involved with Arbcom&#34; being used to describe a group containing two Arbcom members, implies that despite any protestations to the contrary, this <i>is</i> the de facto creation of a group of hotline-to-the-president Power Users, with no prior discussion of the merits and disadvantages of such a sudden change to a hierarchical model of management and of Arbcom&#39;s expansion from a dispute-resolution committee into the Wikipedia Politburo. Even if this <i>is</i> a good proposal, the fact that it&#39;s been forced through as a <i>fait accompli</i> with no consultation, discussion or elections, and with serious problems in representation (where are the bot writers? the FAR reviewers? anyone under 18? anyone from outside the North America/UK/Australia en-wiki heartland?) has poisoned the well from the start, and no proposals emanating from this body in its current state, regardless of their merit, are likely to be taken seriously. This is a step backwards, as even good ideas will be tainted by having come from this source but bad ideas will have the spurious legitimacy of being presented direct to Arbcom. </p>

My idea of the proper relationship between myself and arbcom is to stay as far away from them as possible &#38; I do not think my intended role here will affect that.   It is unavoidably true that we cannot prevent arb com members from discussing and consulting as they please. Better that some of  it at least  be in the open.

<li>This just an patronage outlet for arbcom members to reward friends and in doing so increase the power of the institution. Yes, a few &#34;populist&#34; anti-establishment members of the chattering wiki classes can be brought in for credibility, but Arbcom members can already seek advice from anyone they like without the soft couches and 30 year old scotch of a gentleman&#39;s club. There is already a healthy class of chattering users who do advising and think-tanking; the only new thing this proposal introduces is the power for ArbCom members to confer extra status on users in their interest. <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Advisory Council on Project Development">Wikipedia:Advisory Council on Project Development</a> is another step in the evolutionary path taking ArbCom from being a group of reactive dispute solvers to being wikipedia&#39;s proactive interventionist patronage-orientated government.

<li>Exactly, this a project built on openness - this committee has become exactly the opposite.  And here&#39;s yet another point that should have been mentioned long before: if WP needs an advisory committee why should it only be comprised of wikipedia editors rather than objective outsiders?  Even if we take a slightly different view of what a committee should be if we were going to collect a committee of the best in their feilds why limit ourselves to those already here within the community (no business would do that)?  &#60;br/&#62;Fundamentally, the current shape and function of this &#39;Advisory Committee&#39; just doesn&#39;t work as a part of an open wikimedia community.  Where are the criteria and standards which we&#39;re applied to those invited? Where are the terms of reference for the Committee in its relationship with editors?  Where is the evidence that this is the best idea to fix even some of the projects problems? Where was the consensus for this?--<a href="" title="User:Cailil">&#60;font color=&#34;#999999&#34; size=&#34;2&#34;&#62;<b>Cailil</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>  &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Cailil">&#60;font color=&#34;#999999&#34;&#62;<b>talk</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 18:58, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>ArbCom has stated in several places (no, I&#39;m not digging through thousands of diffs) that they wish to invite non-enwiki people to participate in this. →&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#465945;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>ROUX</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#465945;&#34;&#62;<b>₪</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;small&#62;&#38;nbsp;19:07, 18 July 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;

<dd>In that case two things:&#60;br/&#62; 1) <i>ArbCom</i> shouldn&#39;t be the ones doing the inviting.  Either the community or the Board/Office should do that.  The ArbCom don&#39;t have more privileges than the rest of us editors and they should not act like they do.  Choosing people for a policy development group is not the kind of power that people who are duely elected (and in my case) trusted as arbiters of discipline and dispute resolution.  We don&#39;t let the judges legislate and we don&#39;t let legislators judge.&#60;br/&#62;  That&#39;s the first problem.  2) Secondly we the community need to know why/how those invited get invited.  What are the criteria?  Who decides on them?  &#60;br/&#62;BTW if all of this could be cleared up I wouldn&#39;t be so opposed to a committee in principle - but its current form and the lack of transparency in appointments are huge hurdles--<a href="" title="User:Cailil">&#60;font color=&#34;#999999&#34; size=&#34;2&#34;&#62;<b>Cailil</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>  &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Cailil">&#60;font color=&#34;#999999&#34;&#62;<b>talk</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 22:52, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></li>

<li>Per the wub. How does a group of people discussing problems in order to offer advice constitute a change to a hierarchical system of management? Perhaps it should have been made more clear that ArbCom wasn&#39;t intending to act on this advice with a list of decrees, but I would have thought that would be assumed. I&#39;m having a difficult time understanding the depth of the outrage this proposal has drawn; are folks upset at being excluded? Worried that this &#34;council&#34; will become a de facto governing body? As to the &#34;threat&#34; that ArbCom will simply compose this group without asking permission, I have to ask whose permission is required? If a group of 10 or 20 people get together and decide to discuss things with each other on a project page or user page, who needs to OK that in advance? Which policy allows other people to stop them? What prevents them from creating a (no public archive) mailing list to hammer away at problems?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_Steven_Walling">Statement by Steven Walling</span></h2>
<p>The crux of the concerns thus far elicited seem to revolve around two points:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Concern: The Arbitration Committee&#39;s scope is strictly limited to dispute resolution, and does not in any way include strategic planning or community leadership of any kind, regardless of how such work is organized.
<dl>
<dd>Response: The Council is independent of the Arbitration Commitee in every meaningful sense, despite being called together by Committee members. The group does not &#34;report&#34; to ArbCom in at all, and is simply another volunteer group formed on an ad hoc basis. To say that the Council expands ArbCom&#39;s scope at all is to assign to it more importance than it gives itself. Unlike ArbCom, <i>the Council has no authority whatsoever</i>. No conclusion it reaches or proposal it makes is binding in any fashion, and <i>any Wikipedian is completely free to contradict it, act in opposition to it, or even simply ignore it</i>. It is, in short, a discussion and idea generation group initiated from within but <i>not</i> run by or instilled with the powers of the Arbiration Committee. </dd></dl></li>
<li>Concern: An invitation-only think tank of veteran Wikipedians is a cabal created without community input, and ought to be opened up to election.
<dl>
<dd>Response: An election is the democratic function whereby a group chooses their representatives and invests them with authority. Since the Council has no authority and does not purport to represent Wikipedians or Wikipedia, an election would be a waste of time, and would give the Council an artificial image of influence. What&#39;s more, there is no reason why the Council couldn&#39;t be opened up to membership by anyone in the future. Speaking for myself, there are those either invited to the Council or currently participating in it who would like to see open membership, in order to make the group more useful to the community. </dd></dl></li></ol>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Editors_endorsing_this_statement">Editors endorsing this statement</span></h3>

<ol>
<li>Think of it as a wikiproject with a more abstract scope than most. Ideas emerging from ACPD discussion still need to achieve community consensus in the normal fashion, but having the project encourages the development of well-reasoned ideas considering the broader impact of any actions. If the Council diverges too far from community norms, becomes insular and arrogant, or fails to produce workable ideas, they will be ignored and reviled. If they display incisive thinking, clarity of purpose, and effective communication, they will ... well still be ignored and reviled by some, but may contribute to the long-term viability of this encyclopedia nonetheless. - <a href="" title="User talk:2over0">2/0</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/2over0">cont.</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 18:02, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>I&#39;ll oppose this even though I&#39;ve reached the same basic conclusion, since I think it raises some of the interesting issues.  To speak &#34;constitutionally,&#34; however, it would seem that the legitimacy of this group is least questionable in its role to advise ArbCom.  I can&#39;t see anyone disputing ArbCom&#39;s ability to appoint a purely advisory panel, while if they did, the available remedy would presumably be to vote in a new ArbCom.  This is one anti-judicial aspect of ArbCom, that it <i>is</i> voted in by the community for defined terms so that this option is available (to the extent that the community is entitled to vote, at least).  I can&#39;t ignore: 1.) obviously ArbCom has interests here beyond receiving advice, and 2.) if it is only an arm of ArbCom then presumably it should be a subpage of <a href="" title="WP:Arbitration">WP:Arbitration</a>.  However, the remedy to the first would remain the community&#39;s ability to vote, while the remedy to the second is basically a matter of <a href="" title="WP:BURO">red tape</a> (the community could insist on moving the page, though the effect would go against the suggested need for a more independent group; I&#39;m not sure a move would matter).  At the end of the day, I think creative attempts at more focused and productive discussion are welcome, and the approach here about as sensitive as possible in an unprecedented style of project. <a href="" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mackan79">talk</a>) 07:31, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_Bigtimepeace">Statement by Bigtimepeace</span></h2>
<p>There is one particular aspect of this group which I think needs to be addressed head-on apart from the question of whether we like this or not. Kirill has pointed out <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AArbitration_Committee%2FNoticeboard&#38;diff=301564073&#38;oldid=301562884" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia_talk%3AArbitration_Committee%2FNoticeboard&#38;diff=301564073&#38;oldid=301562884">here</a> that &#34;We [the creators of this group] have tried to make it very explicit that the role of this body is <i>not to decide, but only to discuss</i> and develop ideas for improving the project...&#34; (emphasis added). That sounds good, but in reality I don&#39;t think anyone could seriously claim that that&#39;s how things would work. A group of already &#34;powerful&#34; (loathe as I am to use that term) and well-known editors advising ArbCom is going to end up making decisions (or at the very least pushing the community in a certain direction), even if only &#34;unofficially.&#34; We need to acknowledge that at the outset.</p>
<p>Similarly, the statement at <a href="" title="WP:ACPD">WP:ACPD</a> that &#34;The Advisory Council is not authorized or intended to interfere with normal community discussion in any way; anything it recommends must achieve consensus normally, as any other proposal would, before it can be implemented...&#34; strikes me as hopelessly naive, to be perfectly blunt. The claim that a group constituted by ArbCom to advise them (consisting of a couple of committee members and a number of admins) which brings a proposal to the community will not interfere with &#34;normal community discussion&#34; is inaccurate on the face. Such a thing has never existed before, and the response to proposals from the group (responses which could be very positive or very negative or anywhere in between) will be anything but &#34;normal&#34; for reasons that should be incredibly obvious. Again, let&#39;s acknowledge that right now.</p>
<p>Maybe all of that&#39;s a good thing, and one could think that and still agree with what I&#39;m saying here. My point is that we can&#39;t pretend this is &#34;no big deal&#34;&#38;mdash;that&#39;s it&#39;s just a little think tank with no particular decision-making power and which does not depart from existing community norms all that much. It likely will have some <i>de facto</i> decision making power and is a departure from existing norms in that the community has never in its history discussed a governance proposal which originated from an official body made up of people that ArbCom thinks are smart and helpful (because presumably that would happen at some point). We can debate whether that makes it a good or bad idea as currently constituted, but let&#39;s not downplay the fact that this is in fact a &#34;big deal.&#34; --<a href="" title="User:Bigtimepeace">Bigtimepeace</a> &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User_talk:Bigtimepeace">talk</a> |  <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Bigtimepeace">contribs</a>&#60;/small&#62; 20:43, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Question_on_scale_of_WP_by_Casliber">Question on scale of WP by Casliber</span></h2>
<p>The key question I had during the genesis of the idea is this - has the size and scale of wikipedia meant that simple community consensus is unable to result in beneficial changes as the project evolves. <i>(This was polled recently but I can&#39;t forthe life of me remember where it was/is - a link&#39;d be great!)</i> I think everyone who has commented on this page needs to note yea or nay to this to see how we proceed.</p>

<ol>
<li>Definitely. My objections are to having the ArbCom try to take on this role without the remit, and the creation of a bureaucracy meant to speak for the community without the community&#39;s input or approval. <a href="" title="User:Who then was a gentleman?">Who then was a gentleman?</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Who then was a gentleman?">talk</a>) 22:28, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>Such groups already exist but on the basis of community delegated authority with community based selection, not on the basis of &#34;by invitation&#34;. Moreover, the dichotomy presented here by Casliber tellingly misses all the contentious issues raised by the existence of this new group. <a href="" title="User:CIreland">CIreland</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:CIreland">talk</a>) 22:39, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes, but (as previously mentioned) not a self-appointed clique of you and your buddies. Sorry if that sounds blunt, but that <i>is</i> what this looks like. There are any number of autoconfirmation-style ways to create a group like this without the free-for-all that would result from open-to-everyone, but avoiding the popularity contest element of elections, if you think that&#39;s necessary, although I can&#39;t see why some of you seem so afraid of open elections. (5,000 non-minor mainspace edits? Two years presence on Wikipedia? Anyone who&#39;s written two GAs or FAs higher or written a bot that&#39;s been approved? Secret WMF-trustee style ballots, to avoid it turning into RFA-style shouting matches, with all candidates scoring over 50% passing?) Personally, I think it would make sense to fragment the project into cells (pour yourself a stiff drink and read <a href="#Arbitrary_break:_Today.27s_sermon_is_taken_from_Ecclesiastes.2C_Nabokov_and_Jimmy_Wales" title="User talk:Iridescent">this thread</a> and the <a href="#Speak_of_the_...." title="User talk:Iridescent">one immediately below</a> if you really want my views on the future direction of Wikipedia governance), but that&#39;s neither here nor there as it would never be approved in the current climate. As an interim measure, advisory councils are a good start, but they need to have legitimacy from the outset or they&#39;ll become Diet Coke versions of the Wikipedia Review, filled with people grumbling about assorted problems but without the credibility to get anything changed.&#38;nbsp;–&#38;nbsp;&#60;font color=&#34;#E45E05&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Iridescent">iride</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#C1118C&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Iridescent">scent</a>&#60;/font&#62; 22:47, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>The nature of Wikipedia is very decentralized. Discussion and consensus is accomplished everyday through a decentralized network of conversations (ie. Requests for comments, Noticeboards, etc.).

<li>Per Roux, with the additional observation that the key problem in our case of &#39;<a href="" title="boiling frog">boiling frog</a> syndrome&#39; is that it is almost impossible, and certainly very slow, for any policy or practice to be changed even when it is acknowledged that it needs change.

<li>Yep - but with the comment that the solution may not be removing community involvment in consensus, if that&#39;s the concern. Just that the 200kb discussions that take 3 hours to read, really aren&#39;t an effective way to make or discuss change.

<li>For me the eye-opening event was a discussion at WT:NOT that challenged the validity of NOTGAMEGUIDE, which is something of a bedrock principle for the Video Games project. The structure of en.Wikipedia is such that WikiProjects have a relatively easy time coming to consensus and forming <a href="" title="WP:VG/GL">ad hoc guidelines</a> within itself, but it&#39;s extremely difficult to affect any change at the level of, say, <a href="" title="WP:FICTION">WP:FICTION</a>, a subject area with a long and sordid history at ArbComm. <a href="" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nifboy">talk</a>) 00:38, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>The discussion about flagged revs is particularly illuminating in this regard. It was Jimbo who, in the end, I believe, asked for flagged revs to be turned on.

<li>Endorse. In response to Modernist, I seem to remember that the discussion page was already indicated as a point for non-members to make comments. Granted, that setup might give some the impression that this body does function like, and presumably have similar power, to ArbCom, but I don&#39;t think that was at all the intention. Some sort of way to perhaps limit the size of discussion on the main project or issue page does seem required, else it becomes unreadably long for anyone, and I can and do reasonably think that members would probably provide a link to a talk page comment they think particularly relevant. And, certainly, individual members could create separate subpages, either of the council page/talkpage or of their own pages, to receive input from interested community members. I don&#39;t think that problem is one that is likely to not be addressed almost immediately upon the group becoming active. <a href="" title="User:John Carter">John Carter</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:John Carter">talk</a>) 14:20, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>I&#39;ve only been here since 2006; I don&#39;t recall a time that we ever actually used consensus for decision making on a large scale or significant issue.  Consensus works for small groups, it is not a viable or useful model for Wikipedia.  Given sockpuppetry, voting isn&#39;t exactly problem free either though.  <a href="" title="User:GRBerry">GRBerry</a> 17:35, 20 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ol>

<li>I agree that the current consensus process can be stubborn and frustrating. However, I don&#39;t want to prejudge the answer to that by saying a &#34;group&#34; is needed to fix it. Especially not a powerless advisory body. The inability to resolve conflicts that many people see as important, and the endless repititions of certain policy disputes are fundamentally a failure of process. One solution is to create a legislative body to make the hard choices for us, but that&#39;s only one solution, and it limits the power of the majority of editors. An alternative, and one I&#39;d like to see considered, is to change the process by which major policy decisions are considered. I&#39;d like to see a centralized forum created for discussing and disposing of contentious policy issues. And I think it necessary that we move in the direction of voting (or !voting, if you insist) on many of these issues that can&#39;t be resolved even after extended discussion. We already do this quite a bit in practice, but we call them straw polls, often consider them non-binding and scatter them throughout the site. Binding polls at a centralized forum, have the potential to overcome the limitations of parochial interests and provide closure to many problematic issues. To the extent that a &#34;group&#34; is needed to help move us forward, I would say that the right group is not a legislature or an advisory council but rather a cross between clerks and Wikipedia Bureaucrats. People whose job it is to organize discussions, to structure and oversee polling when necessary, and in borderline cases to interpret the results of those polls. Personally, I think the community&#39;s problem is not that we lack good ideas, but rather that we have a decision making process that paralyzes us, and that is what we most need to reform in my opinion. <a href="" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dragons flight">talk</a>) 01:01, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s the job of an advisory group to generate proposals on anything when they have the mind, instead they investigate issues they are asked to investigate (and &#39;project development&#39; is way too general, see my proposal for elaboration), then publish their findings and advises. A group of volunteer clerks to help in facilitating consensus could be useful, but anyone could do that, with a central page like <a href="" title="WP:Coordination">WP:Coordination</a>, as base.

<li>I agree that consensus, as currently practiced, is extremely difficult, or possibly impossible, to attain for certain high-level Wikipedia decisions. The way consensus is found for macro-level decisions needs tweaking or we might need to fall back on some form of democracy in some cases.

<li>The Council is just another mode of discussion, and decision-making power would still rest with the community consensus. If anyone thinks our current deliberative process is broken at the core, then the Council isn&#39;t going to fix that. I for one have never seen evidence that Wikipedia is fundamentally broken.

<li>Quite possibly we need someone to write a practical guide to getting results from Wikipedia&#39;s formal and informal consensus-building processes - but it absolutely is possible to get reasonable results from those processes with a little effort. &#60;span  style=&#34;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;— <a href="" title="User:Gavia immer">Gavia immer</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gavia immer">talk</a>)&#60;/span&#62; 23:48, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>No...and I saw this with a great deal of reservation.  I&#39;m tempted to say yes because I watched the community simply make the <b>wrong</b> decision about PLOT and FICT over and over again.  But I think that temptation should be resisted.  We see large changes like flagged revisions seeing little consensus, and this infuriates us, because it appears as though FR are necessary for wikipedia to become a functioning resource.  But I don&#39;t think that the folks who oppose FR feel the same way, just as I imagine the folks who feel differently about PLOT and FICT don&#39;t bemoan the outcomes of those RfCs.  Wikipedia has some paralysis, even some paralysis beyond what might be expected for its scale.  Wikipedia has some dysfunction as regards authority (maybe feature, not bug?).  I also think the fundamental Hayekian principle behind Wikipedia is a little misguided.  But these don&#39;t convince me that a creature like this commission is necessary or sufficient (though I don&#39;t think the proponents are suggesting that it is sufficient) to solve those problems.  We are straight-jacketed by arbcom&#39;s mandate to steer clear of content.  We do have a dispute resolution system that doesn&#39;t resolve disputes.  The consensus model does break down when external interests are at stake or discussions are proxies for boundary maintenance among community members.  But I don&#39;t think scale alone causes the traditional methods of consensus and DR to fail occasionally. <a href="" title="User:Protonk">Protonk</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Protonk">talk</a>) 02:10, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>Per Protonk.  I don&#39;t see &#34;bigger&#34; as a reason that consensus can&#39;t work - rather the opposite I would think.  I agree that there are things that can, and should, be improved; but I&#39;d rather see that done on a community level rather than have it dictated from above. — &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #000000;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;&#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:Ched Davis">Ched</a>&#60;/b&#62; : <a href="" title="User_talk:Ched Davis">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#FFFFFF;background:#0000fa;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;?&#38;nbsp;&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 04:43, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>It takes effort and requires that the present situation be identified as a problem, but that is not a bad thing. I suspect that the main issue is that in many specific areas there is no consensus that the existing situation is not right/broken. If there is no consensus that a specific area is broken then of course it is going to be difficult/impossible to get consensus to change it, as those who disagree that there is a major problem will not support a change. Get consensus that there is a problem first, then discuss how to change it - again I suspect that many of those who think consensus is failing all have different areas/reasons for thinking it is failing and would not agree on which areas/policies need to change significantly. <a href="" title="User:Davewild">Davewild</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Davewild">talk</a>) 07:14, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>The answer would be &#34;Yes&#34; <i>if</i> this were an actual community that had to make decisions concernin the allocation of a budget.  But we are not.  We are volunteers writing an encyclopedia.  The whole point of Wikipedia - the <i>gamble</i> of Wikipedia - is that, unlike what Encyclopedia Brittanica proposes, a great encyclopedia can be written without <i>any</i> editorial leadership or centralized authority.  Wikipedia says that it is possible for anyone to edit at any time and if this is open to everyone, the cummulitive effect will be a great encyclopedia.  Maybe Jimbo is wrong, in which case you should apply for a job at Encyclopedia Brittanica.  But so far I am betting on Jimbo.  We have ArbCom for interpersonal disputes, and a range of policies to guide the writing of content.  So far it works pretty well.  Of course the wiki nature means that it is easy to vandalize and easy for a troll to have his or he way for a while, but the Wikipedia gamble is that other editors will eventually drive vandals and trolls away.  But this is an endless cycle.  people who think Wikipedia is broken are just ignorant, they do not know that Wikipedia has always had to live with these problems.  And over time we have always, eventually, dealt with them.  it doesn&#39;t matter whether there are 100 wikipedians or 100 million.  We will always attract vandals and trolls, and always have POV conflicts.  But thanks to policies like NPOV and DE, we eventually solve our problems.  I see no need for any kind of governance in orde to write an on-line encyclopedia.  if you do, go over to Larry Sanger&#39;s Nu-pedia, that is the project for you. <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 00:55, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>Slrubenstein for president! The success of Wikipedia is the community involvement. Yes that also means at times that change can be slow - but I&#39;d rather have that small and safe flaw, than to reduce the community to a workforce under the direction of a party whose views will be (however well intentioned) those of a limited membership. The community governs itself, and does it very well. People electing themselves as governors over me when I am happy and making progress (albeit slowly at times) seems inappropriate. The strength of the community is the range of views and the lack of a hierarchy which means that discussion is entered into to settle disputes rather than a detached decision from a pseudo-authority figure. Where an individual is unwilling to enter into or respond to discussion is where we need ArbCom - not anywhere else. &#60;span style=&#34;border: 1px  #F10; background-color:cream;&#34;&#62;<b><a href="" title="User:SilkTork">&#60;font face=&#34;Script MT&#34; color=&#34;#1111AA&#34; size=&#34;2&#34;&#62;SilkTork&#60;/font&#62;</a></b> *<a href="" title="User talk:SilkTork">&#60;sup&#62;YES!&#60;/sup&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62; 23:02, 20 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ol>

<dd>In reply to Philca: And with that comes a need for good governance, separation of powers, avoidance of conflict of interest, voters being allowed to elect people to positions of power, and knowing exactly who they&#39;re electing, all the things that are missing from this Council. We voted last time for ArbCom members who would turn their back on the old style of governance we had, with ArbCom assuming powers it didn&#39;t have and presiding arrogantly over the community, yet this idea, and the way it was put together, seems to be very much part of that old style. &#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a>&#60;/font&#62; &#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:SlimVirgin|talk">SlimVirgin|talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;pink&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/SlimVirgin">contribs</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 22:53, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>All of which is true. Not wanting to pre-judge things, I would not be surprised if the sort of thing Pilcha or SV want is what we talk about or recommend. Unfortunately, in practice, most -- possibly all-- volunteer communities are controlled formally or informally by a small in-group, and such elections as there are tend to be shams, because only the in-group gets itself organized. The usual real world solution is a split. We have already had one, and the existence of Citizendium has had positive effects on Wikipedia <b><a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> (<a href="" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a>) 23:27, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Further to Slim&#39;s comment above: This initiative cannot be seen as anything but an attempt to expand ArbCom&#39;s scope into the &#34;House of Commons&#34; role; to appoint and be advised by a body with a broad scope that would almost certainly include governance and content assumes that ArbCom has authority in those areas. </p>
<p>The odd thing is that this initiative comes just at the time when ArbCom&#39;s constitution (policy) is about to be changed to restrict ArbCom&#39;s scope. Take a look at <a href="#Scope" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration/Policy">the existing policy</a>, which contains quite a bit of wriggle-room for exceeding the original conception of a judicial body that deals solely with behavioural matters: the wriggle-room is coloured. Compare this against <a href="#Duties_and_responsibilities" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration_Committee/Draft_policy">the draft new policy</a>, which removes the generalities, the exceptions, the vagueness.</p>
<p><b>EXISTING POLICY</b></p>
<p><b>Scope</b></p>
<p>The Committee reserve the right to hear or not hear any dispute, at their discretion. The following are &#60;font color=red&#62;<b>general</b>&#60;/font&#62; guidelines which will apply to &#60;font color=red&#62;<b>most</b>&#60;/font&#62; cases, &#60;font color=red&#62;<b>but the Committee may make exceptions</b>&#60;/font&#62;.
</p>
<ol>
<li>The Committee will hear disputes that have been referred to Arbitration by the Mediation Committee.</li>
<li>Where a dispute has not gone through mediation, or the earlier steps in the dispute resolution process, the Arbitrators may refer the dispute to the Mediation Committee if it believes mediation is likely to help.</li>
<li>The Committee will occasionally request advice from Jimbo Wales on whether to hear a particular dispute.</li>
<li>The Committee will &#60;font color=red&#62;<b>primarily</b>&#60;/font&#62; investigate interpersonal disputes.</li>
<li>The Committee will hear or not hear disputes according to the wishes of the community, where there is a consensus.</li>
<li>The Committee will not hear disputes where they have not been requested to rule.</li>
<li>The Committee has no jurisdiction over official actions of the Wikimedia Foundation.</li></ol>


<p><b>DRAFT NEW POLICY</b></p>
<p><b>Duties and responsibilities</b></p>
<p>The Arbitration Committee of the English Wikipedia has the following duties and responsibilities:
</p>
<ol>
<li>To act as a binding decision-maker for disputes concerning the conduct of Wikipedia editors;[1]</li>
<li>To consider appeals[2] from blocked, banned, or otherwise restricted users;</li>
<li>To deal summarily with urgent or emergency matters—for example, blatant abuse of administrator or other privileges, and threatening or malicious conduct—that presents a danger[3] to the project or its contributors;</li>
<li>To deal with issues that are unsuitable for public discussion because of privacy or similar concerns; and</li>
<li>To appoint[4] those functionaries granted access to privileged information, including the holders of the CheckUser and Oversight privileges</li></ol>


<p>I welcome this removal of policy incentives for ArbCom to exceed its role as a judge of editors&#39; behaviour. The Date Delinking Case, for example, contained motions that clearly went beyond behavioural matters, seeking to instruct the community on how the terms &#34;must&#34; and &#34;should&#34; are to be defined in the style guides, and making declarations on the status of developers. Fortunately, these motions failed, but under the new policy, would have been struck down before the arbs voted on them. The existing policy allows such extensions into what would be regarded as the normal realm of a government. </p>
<p>I believe the community should support this aspect of the new draft policy, and in a similar vein insist that the Advisory Council <i>not</i> be constituted as advising ArbCom. There&#39;s a fundamental constitutional problem here, quite apart from the likelihood that Kirill&#39;s expectation of a &#34;high signal-to-noise ratio&#34; will not be born out, given the size and diversity of the membership. Let&#39;s face it, in a wiki, politics is for the people, however they may bumble through with their squabbling and noise and the typical failure of initiatives to gain traction. IMO, arguments above that the size of the project makes representative government necessary fly in the face of the very advantages of an online wiki project: it allows many people to participate in decision-making. <a href="" title="User:Tony1">&#60;font color=&#34;darkgreen&#34;&#62;<b>Tony</b>&#60;/font &#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Tony1">&#60;font color=&#34;darkgreen&#34;&#62;(talk)&#60;/font &#62;</a> 09:39, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The proposed changes to the Arbcom policy changes are an important aspect of this, so I am glad you raised it here.  Please consider the combined effect of:
<dl>
<dd>a) the proposed Arbcom policy changes that you have highlighted above, and</dd>
<dd>b) this advisory council.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>The two are complementary changes which result in an Arbcom which has a reduced scope, and a new group established with the high hopes that it will step in to partially fill the vacuum.  The design of this new group is intended to ensure it doesn&#39;t end up like Arbcom, as it is not based on private communications and enforcible decisions.  Also, if the community doesn&#39;t find this council to be useful, they can disregard it, however Arbcom will still have a reduced scope if the proposed arbitration policy changes come into effect.</dd>
<dd>Anyone who thinks that this group of people will be subservient to the arbitration committee is insulting the people that have been selected.  I am sure we could have selected a better nucleus of people, if given more time and community involvement, however the arbitration committee has gone out of its way to include a set of people who have different worldviews, including some who been ardently anti-Arbcom in order to prevent the council becoming an Arbcom sidekick.  And this group will only survive if finds a way to expand or renew its membership without becoming a &#34;self-selecting group&#34;.  Maybe this group will only make one recommendation: a replacement for itself.</dd>
<dd>Perhaps we should have called it an &#34;<i>Interim</i> Advisory Council..&#34;, as it was not the intention of the committee for it&#39;s membership or structure to become set in stone; there were many internal comments by arbitrators that it would likely need to reform itself within the first twelve months.  This is similar in spirit to how we set up the audit subcommittee with a pre-determined membership, but our decision made it explicit that the community had to take ownership of the process of selecting replacements.</dd>
<dd>As an example of how this council may be able to counter-balance arbcom, I suggested to arbcom that this council should oversee the ongoing reforms of the arbitration policy.  I don&#39;t like the arbitration committee being the caretaker of the policy which constrains itself, and believe a council like this will be more suited to coordinate changes to the arbitration policy. The arbitration committee should continue to improve our own internal processes, but the scope should be managed by the community.</dd>
<dd>Another reason for a council of this sort is to avoid another date delinking case.  Or failing that, if one does happen (<a href="" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> is likely to be the next one, but BLP/Flagged Revs may also rapidly turn into a bitter mess), and if this council does have some runs on the board, the arbitration committee could refer the matter to this council to be worked through as a &#34;project&#34; rather than the arbitration committee attempting to solely address the user conduct while leaving the underlying problem unsolved.</dd>

<dd>John, I am delighted that my understanding of this change was correct—the proper definition of ArbCom&#39;s scope (a more restrained one) in the draft new policy. For the sake of community input, I believe it might have been better for all of the changes to have been supported by a summary that made explicit the strategy behind them; I only noticed this major change a few days ago while comparing the existing and proposed policy documents, and I do believe no one outside the Committee has been aware of it until now.</dd>
<dd>If &#34;Advisory&#34; is taken out of the name of the new body, and it is cast as independent of ArbCom (i.e., not advising it, but perhaps examining what it wants to as well as matters of procedure, constitution and content that are referred to it by ArbCom), it begins to present less of a constitutional problem <i>per se</i>. But I am still nervous about its ability to do anything but repeat all of the foibles—the squabbling, the circle-treading, the ultimate inaction—of much community discussion, except in a more concentrated, high-profile forum. There is, of course, a precedent for the establishment of authority, although it is rooted in the early days when the project was relatively innocent: the FAC process, with Raul as Director; in turn, more recently, Raul has anointed the FAC Delegates (his assistants), and the community-elected inaugural FLC directorate, both of which have proved highly successful. But no one elected Raul in the first place. It has turned out well, but it was a gamble. <a href="" title="User:Tony1">&#60;font color=&#34;darkgreen&#34;&#62;<b>Tony</b>&#60;/font &#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Tony1">&#60;font color=&#34;darkgreen&#34;&#62;(talk)&#60;/font &#62;</a> 14:07, 13 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think you have identified the biggest problem: Communication of the vision or strategy behind the reforms.  The message isnt always clear because the committee has been building it in an ad-hoc fashion, as time allows and needs dictate.  The core of the problem is that we started off this year with 15 visions, and we only learn where those overlap gradually when proposals are made.  The difficulty of obtaining consensus within the committee has often meant that some proposals take forever to make it out the door (such as the the arbcom policy reform), while others are quickly passed and sometimes arrive half-baked.</dd>
<dd>The &#34;Advisory&#34; aspect is quite crucial in my opinion (the concept rather than the name), however I think some people have read too much into it &#34;advising Arbcom&#34;.  My understanding is that this council will provide advice on large problems that face the community.  There will be times when this advice is needed in a timely manner by Arbcom, but hopefully this council will be delivering advice that the community picks up, thereby solving problems before arbitration is required.  If the arbitration committee does take advice from this council, it will be in lieu of a) soliciting advice privately, or b) trying to make sense of responses given to a public request.</dd>
<dd>I agree that this council needs to break free from ArbCom, and that this will be a difficult road in the current climate. &#60;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:John Vandenberg">John Vandenberg</a> &#60;sup&#62;<b>(<a href="" title="User talk:John Vandenberg">chat</a>)</b>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/span&#62; 18:24, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>We discussed this on the arb mailing list. This shouldn&#39;t be too had to nut out. I saw my place as a content contributor, wikiprojects person and also a liaison with the arbitration committee. Do people see this combination as a net positive (eg. global view) or net negative (eg. COI) on such a committee as the ACPD? I was initially in favour of the ACPD as deciding whether there should be any arbs on the group.

<li>If it is supposed to be an advisory body to Arbcom, it make sense to have at least one member there to field questions and give background. If that position is one without say, voting rights within the council, then that might be a way to achieve the function without the worry. But, if the council is supposed to be representative of the community and include various constituent groups, arbcom would naturally be part of that and so a vote makes sense by extension. --<a href="" title="User:Joopercoopers">Joopercoopers</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Joopercoopers">talk</a>) 23:52, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>I&#39;m indifferent to the presence or absence of arbitrators on the council though having arbitrators (in their private capacity) involved would result in more informed feedback to ArbCom. I cannot see this as a net negative. &#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Roger Davies">&#60;span style=&#34;color:maroon; font-variant:small-caps&#34;&#62;<b>Roger&#38;nbsp;Davies</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Roger Davies"><b>talk</b></a>&#60;/sup&#62; 08:06, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>I&#39;m also indifferent to the presence of one or two arbs on the council, <i>as long as the council is not advising ArbCom</i>.

<li>Not a problem, and a net positive, so long as the council is a mere think tank without executive powers, which presents ideas on how to solve intractable problems to the community for approval.

<li>&#34;Weak net negative&#34;. Nothing against you or Kyrill personally, but I think having serving arbs on a council like this opens a can of worms. What happens when a policy approved by the council is challenged and goes to arbitration? When the council is discussing an issue and you have the unfair advantage of knowing how the rest of the arbs will vote on it? Besides, if this ends up making (or recommending) policy decisions, your presence may have a chilling effect, as people may feel that your side is bound to win. We already have this problem in any contentious area – just look at the inevitable flurry whenever Jimmy Wales decides to opine on something. While the old hands can and do argue with the powers-that-be, plenty of newer or less active editors feel that it&#39;s somehow inappropriate to disagree with those in a position of authority.&#38;nbsp;–&#38;nbsp;&#60;font color=&#34;#E45E05&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Iridescent">iride</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#C1118C&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Iridescent">scent</a>&#60;/font&#62; 00:18, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think it arguably depends (could I hedge my bets any more!), but as currently conceived ArbCom member presence is likely a net negative, if only in the realm of public perception (which is not a small deal, obviously). If the remit of this group comes from ArbCom and if the group is supposed to advise yet be independent of ArbCom, then I think it inadvisable for there to be ArbCom members on it, simply because there would be the perception (rightly or wrongly) that it was the ArbCom&#39;s &#34;pet committee&#34; (to quote a <a href="" title="The Cradle Will Rock">famous musical</a>). However if we, taking on board the obvious objections to this whole proposal here in the RfC, say that the remit of the Advisory Council ultimately comes from the <i>community</i>&#38;mdash;i.e. if we hash out the specifics and come to some rough agreement about what something like this would look like&#38;mdash;then having a couple of ArbCom members probably makes sense. If the Advisory Council is essentially answerable to/at the service of the project as a whole, unwieldy as that may seem and be, I think there would be less objection to arbs sitting on it. I do think we are putting the cart before the horse somewhat in even asking this question, as there is clearly significant objection to this entire endeavor as currently laid out and I think we need to deal with the larger issues first. --<a href="" title="User:Bigtimepeace">Bigtimepeace</a> &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User_talk:Bigtimepeace">talk</a> |  <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Bigtimepeace">contribs</a>&#60;/small&#62; 00:25, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Clearly the involvement with and presence of Arbitrators on the Council is a net negative in the eyes of the community. If it&#39;s truly to be a community-sanctioned body to develop ideas for the project, it should come from a broader swathe on contributors, and less from judicial-type bodies like ArbCom. &#60;font style=&#34;font-family: Hoefler Text&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Steven Walling">Steven Walling</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Steven Walling">(talk)</a>&#60;/font&#62; 00:57, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Arbs should be cordially invited to contribute comments or suggestions on the talk page but there is little to gain by having one more voice on the official page. The presence of an Arb will alter the internal dynamics and question the degree of the council&#39;s independence — that&#39;s a lot to sacrifice so one person can have a little more power. --<a href="" title="User:Maclean25">maclean</a> 02:33, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>ArbCom appears unclear as to the  role of an ArbCom member.

<dd>That is incorrect.  My statement is that the council <b>as a whole</b> would not be a liason between the community and the committee.  Cas is saying that he sees his role on council consisting of liaising between the council and the committee.  I can see some value in having arbcom members on the council, but I can also see the benefit of excluding arbitration committee members in order that they are more distinct. &#60;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:John Vandenberg">John Vandenberg</a> &#60;sup&#62;<b>(<a href="" title="User talk:John Vandenberg">chat</a>)</b>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/span&#62; 08:17, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></li>
<li>This is clearly a net negative.  When ArbCom is selecting its own advisors that&#39;s already a COI.  When they&#39;re selecting them from their own membership, that also blatantly violates the Advisory Council&#39;s statement of purpose.  <a href="" title="User:Edward321">Edward321</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Edward321">talk</a>) 19:59, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>Nothing personal about Cas or Krill as I believe both to be fine gentlemen but, yes, an overlap or blending of membership is, in my most honest opinion, a net negative. And honestly, having ArbCom members on their own advisory group seems like circular nonsense to me which would likely have a degrading, undermining effect for reasons mentioned above by Iri and Bigtimepeace. I don&#39;t have a problem with ArbCom taking advice from whoever they so desire for arbitration and dispute resolution purposes, but this is obviously much more than that. <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 13:35, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Net negative: Just because the arbs got <b>elected</b> to solve intractable disputes doesn&#39;t mean its ok or beneficial for wikipedia for such persons to establish another hierarchy of networkers and flatterers, independent of the community and dependent on them, to lord it over wikipedia&#39;s core users. They should stick to their role, and if the community decides it needs to give badges to some chatterers then the community can do it. <a href="" title="User:Deacon of Pndapetzim">Deacon of Pndapetzim</a> (&#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Deacon of Pndapetzim">Talk</a>&#60;/small&#62;) 00:23, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ol>

<li>I think representing all walks of Wikipedians is a good idea, though the inclusion of an ArbCom member might be blurring some lines a bit much, as the group is meant to be advisory. While &#39;separation of powers&#39; may be overstating the issue slightly, it&#39;s the closest relevant phrase to describe it. The makeup of the rest of the committee is what&#39;s concerning; as it stands, the current membership of the committee is something like 85% administrators... a group that makes up 10% of the active editors. I think the problems with that are relatively obvious. →&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#6D351A;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>ROUX</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#6D351A;&#34;&#62;<b>₪</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;small&#62;&#38;nbsp;23:50, 11 July 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;</li></ul>

<li>The RfC is premature, but it springs naturally from a badly thought-out and badly-presented idea.  Quite how the ArbCom members involved in it thought that presenting a <i>fait accompli</i> like this to the community - especially when it was utterly unclear what the actual purpose and scope of the Council is - was a good idea completely baffles me.  I am equally surprised that none of the 18 members who accepted positions raised any red flags either - if indeed they were informed that this is how it would be presented. It is a shame, as the actual membership of this putative body is a pretty good one, if somewhat admin-heavy.

There has been much criticism of ArbCom for NOT listening... when it sets up something structured (and please look again at the names on the list... some very competent people on there) it&#39;s greeted with howls.

<dd>There is another angle to the democracy issue. The arbitration committee are representatives democratically elected by the community, right? It is not generally considered undemocratic if a democratically elected body appoints specialists to advise them, is it? Many democratically elected bodies, up to and including national governments, employ think thanks or consultancy firms composed of people selected meritocratically, for their insight and expertise. This council here is actually holding its deliberations in public, with an opportunity for others to make an input on a talk page, unlike the think tanks our governments employ, or the back channels used in WP to date. <b>&#60;font color=&#34;#0000FF&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Jayen466">JN</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34; #FFBF00&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_Talk:Jayen466">466</a>&#60;/font&#62;</b> 18:28, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b>  If the critics are off the mark, then perhaps the supporters should do a better job of explaining.  Nothing in the page on the Advisory Council gives any indication that this will reduce or eliminate ArbCom&#39;s role.  I recommend supporters provide clear explanations for why they believe this Council will reduce or eliminate ArbCom&#39;s role, why they believed it was a good idea to not discuss it with the general community, what the qualifications are for being selected for the Council, why they though it was a good idea to ignore forming concensus at <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Self electing groups">Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Self electing groups</a>, and why they thought it was a good idea to repeatly violate the Council&#39;s purpose statement by putting multiple members of ArbCom on the Council.  <a href="" title="User:Edward321">Edward321</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Edward321">talk</a>) 20:45, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The reason that the RFC is premature is because that we were in the process of launching the ACPD when the RFC was started. The Committee knew that the ideas about the new Council would need to be explained. We were just getting started. <a href="" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a><a href="" title="User talk:FloNight">&#38;#9829;&#38;#9829;&#38;#9829;</a> 21:50, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The RFC came 38 hours after the APCD was announced at ArbCom, 27 hours after the APCD members were publicly informed.  Obviously, the APCD and potential members were discussed before that.  If ArbCom realized that the ACPD needed to be explained, that seems ample time for ArbCom and/or the ACPD to have prepared an explanation.  It would still be helpful if the questions I asked were answered.  <a href="" title="User:Edward321">Edward321</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Edward321">talk</a>) 22:33, 12 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>To my mind the RFC was started prematurely. Very soon after the ACPD was announced and before most of the Community had time to know that it existed and before the Committee had a chance to answer the questions that were coming in. If you look on the Notice Board, members of the Committee were answering questions. You need to remember that we are volunteers with full lives outside of Wikipedia. We live in half a dozen time zones around the world. We also had other Committee work to complete simultaneously. Thus my support of the statement in this section. You can disagree if you want. But it is my perspective. </dd>
<dd>To answer a few of your question. Currently, ArbCom <b>IS</b> tasked with doing some types of work that fall outside of dispute resolution. Member of the Committee do not think that this needs to remain the same. But unfortunately, the Community has been lagging behind in filling the gap with stable alternatives that have good Community consensus. For example, selecting the people that have special access tools such as Oversight and Checkuser. The members of the Committee also have the tools. As well, ArbCom is responsible for monitoring these users use of the tools. Many members of the 2009 Committee want to  move away from this model, so we started an Audit Subcommittee that includes three members of the Community. We started the process after the Community had several failed attempts to get something off the ground. In a few weeks, ArbCom will be holding the second cycle of Community election to select people to use the tools. At this time, the Committee is still completely responsible for running the elections. I think that ACPD could discuss alternative ways to hold the elections that would still meet the requirements of the Foundation for selecting users, allow vetting of the users for significant problems in their editing history, and allow for Community voting, and certification of the results by a election committee. Because the process that Wikipedia English is using is working pretty well, there has not been loads of support for altering the process from the Community. But since the task of selecting the people with special access is not part of dispute resolution, then it makes sense to examine this tradition to see if alternative scenarios will give as good or better results. In my opinion, this type of policy change discussion needs to happen after participants have time to do research into the issues. The ACPD could do the background research, make several alternative proposals, and offer them to the Community to review. Unfortunately, in the past, new Community proposals stall because there was not enough preparatory work done. Also, the several alternative that may be proposed are not offered in a way that lets one or the other gain full Community consensus. </dd>
<dd>Since the Community seems uncertain about how to get think tanks started, the Committee decided to jump start the process. I think that once the ball gets rolling, then the Community will see the value in changing the way that policy and processes are altered, and a new improved form of ACPD will happen. More later.

<li>Yes. Better than the &#34;unofficial, off-wiki, smoke-filled rooms and backdoor channels&#34; used until now, and doubtless used again if this initiative were allowed to fail. It seems some people prefer the old way. Neither the arbitration committee nor this council have any power to &#34;govern the project&#34; unless it be the power to come up with good, practicable ideas which the community can then adopt or reject at its discretion, based on the ideas&#39; merits. Analogies of &#34;power users&#34; with a &#34;hotline to the president&#34; are totally inappropriate, given that the arbitration committee does not <i>have</i> executive powers to govern the project, and will not gain them through the formation of this <i>think tank</i>, either. By all means, Durova, SlimVirgin &#38; Co., go on the barricades if there is any sign of this body or the arbitration committee unilaterally appropriating governance authority – I would join you under such circumstances, and am confident that the community would win that battle hands down – but this is not the time for it. I believe this is about something else, with the potential to change WP culture for the better.

<li>Let the Council get started before taking shots at it.  This whole page, with its 100s of kb, is an attempt to criticize and condemn something that has not yet occurred.  (It is analogous to a wife tellng her husband not to buy tissue because he would buy the wrong color box.)  There are indications that the RfC was started and is being pushed by editors who have personal issues with ArbCom and/or some of its members.  </li></ol>

<li>So we should just sit around and wait until such a time as things people are afraid will happen, actually happen?  When this &#34;policy advisory committee&#34; issues a recommendation for a particular governance action, which gets endorsed by the ArbCom even though neither body has the right to make such recommendations, nor to enforce them?  Is the ArbCom so afraid of the community that not only do they present these undemocratic actions as Star Chamber <i>faits accomplis</i>, but are unwilling to listen to the community when we object?  The ArbCom presented this as having already occurred with no community input, nor even warning that it was going to happen, and now we should lie back and take it?  <a href="" title="User:Who then was a gentleman?">Who then was a gentleman?</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Who then was a gentleman?">talk</a>) 19:32, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>As I have said elsewhere, I have a great deal of respect for many of the admins who supported this council.

<dd>It doesn&#39;t matter if a different group comes up with a different view or not.  What matters is the ArbCom coming up with this body despite having no authority to do so.  And apparent lack of consensus from the community.  But it appears that the ArbCom will bull through and do what they want despite objections.  And it&#39;s ironic, isn&#39;t it, that members of the new &#34;advisory council&#34; are already making personal attacks against the opposition.

<li><b>OPPOSE</b> every wiki-project has been open to anyone who wanted to participate in it.  This one is not.  This not only sets a dangerous precedent, it betrays a core principle of Wikipedia, its openness.  I have no problem with the membership of ArbCom being limited.  If ArbCom feels its membership is too small, then lets discuss increasing its size.  But what right does ArbCom have to create a restricted Wikiproject?  ArbCom exists to resolve conflicts among editors involving personal behavior policies.  How does that justify its creating new wikiprojects? <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 01:07, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>What right?! The same right that others have used in creating sooper sekret off-Wiki mailing lists and IRC channels with highly selective memberships for the purpose of gaming WP&#39;s processes to their own advantages. Your open, wiki ideal was subverted long ago in practice, and not by the current ArbCom nor by the members of the Advisory think tank!--<a href="" title="User:R.D.H. (Ghost In The Machine)">R.D.H.

<dl>
<dd>I agree with you that sooper sekret off-Wiki mailing lists and IRC channels with highly selective memberships were and are dangerous.  That is why I think institutionalizing them is wrong.  Creating a project council will not solve the transparency problem, they will certainly communicate off-wiki; all it does is give them a privileged position to do so.  ArbCom already does so which I find acceptable as long as ArbCom has a relatively narrow brief.  Let&#39;s keep it that way. <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 12:01, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I wonder what drives the view that project administration should maintain exactly the same kind of egalitarianism as content development. The existence of ArbCom itself, and the concept of administrators, has generally accepted that project administration needs some structure, the influence of which we then try not to let upset equal standing when it comes to content development.  Then there&#39;s the development of the software itself, which so far as I&#39;m aware we editors don&#39;t control at all.  I can see why someone would want this group to be organized differently (reversing the roles of ArbCom and an appointed group would make sense on some levels), but it&#39;s hard to see how having a limited panel is by itself anti-Wikipedian. <a href="" title="User:Mackan79">Mackan79</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mackan79">talk</a>) 07:29, 19 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is nothing inherant in the &#34;concept&#34; of administrators is somehow contrary to egaitraianism.  You may not have been around when administrators were first created, buddy boy, but I was.  First they were called sysops, systems operators.  They have certain abilities, like protecting pages, but admins were never supposed to use these powers based on their own personal views.  Admins are servants of the community.  If the community wants a page protected, they order the admin to do it.  If the community wants someone banned, they tell the admin to make it so.  Admins are public servants - <i>servants</i>. <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 10:02, 19 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Then why limit administrator rights to just some?  You seem to say that consensus is all it takes.  I have been around long enough to hear Jimbo consistently describe his role as facilitating the implementation of consensus, rather than to act against it.  Like him or not, the point is that large and unlimited groups (like don&#39;t generally exist at individual articles) will not necessarily have an easy time developing and realizing specific proposals.  </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></li></ol>

<li>I don&#39;t  have a problem with non-admins per se.

That&#39;s distinct from simply not running for adminship.

<p>Wikipedia is functionally broken. Nothing ever gets done, and too many people are self-appointed politicians. Any positive changes require increasingly overwhelming and increasingly unlikely consensus due to persistent handfuls of users that scream all manner of nonsense from CREEP to BURO to ABCD as reasons to shut down any change. Some feel that it&#39;s not needed, whatever &#34;it&#34; is, but clearly &#34;it&#34; is needed or more and more people wouldn&#39;t be screaming for It. Our public reputation is in tatters, Jimbo Wales for whatever reason is now unwilling to put his foot down on even simple things (Where are our Flagged Revisions?), and the Arbcom tries to do <i>one</i> thing to facilitate simple <i>discussion</i> of possible changes--not even possible changes--and everyone goes mental, leading to the resignations of two Arbs.</p>
<p>This site is getting increasingly fucked by various degrees of irrelevant politics and pointless cults of personality, and I fear that unless we do have some sort of sweeping, perhaps militant action, things are going to increasingly spiral out of control and South year over year.

<li>I wouldn&#39;t say <i>Wikipedia is functionally broken</i>. The governance structure, absolutely.

<li>Kudos for trying something bold and new; I proposed such committees/think tanks when I ran for ArbCom.  I should also confess that if I <i>disliked</i> the members the ArbCom had invited, I would be much more upset about this sort of thing, but they are all very sensible and thoughtful people, which brings me to another point.... Durova and SV are whining about this invitation-only stuff, but not so long ago they were the dual queens of behind-the-scenes clubhousing (remember the wiki-stalking mailing list?  Those were the days).  This council&#39;s actions appear to be public, and they can be held accountable for their good or bad findings.  Methinks if the council consisted of fewer members with whom SV had quarreled in the past, her objections would be less strenuous.--<a href="" title="User:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">The Fat Man Who Never Came Back</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:The Fat Man Who Never Came Back">talk</a>) 13:45, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>&#34;Nothing ever gets done&#34; lots of things still get done, although there are specific point failing and having problems. Trying to replace the whole system is a mistake since you will throw away also the things that made it grow in the first place. --<a href="" title="User:Enric Naval">Enric Naval</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Enric Naval">talk</a>) 04:51, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>&#34;Nothing ever gets done?&#34;  Dude, people are working on articles all the time.  I mean, this really is the ONLY thing we are supposed to be doing, right?  Researching and writing articles?  just today one collaborator wrote a brilliant section on language and culture for the culture article - that is something getting done!  Why do you bring up politics?  Rootology, I think you have mistaken Wikipedia for a Dungeons and Dragons game.  If you want to play Dungeons and Dragons, go ahead.  But stick around here if you want to write encyclopedia articles.  Not sure what to write?  Check on at my user talk page and i will suggest to you five articles or sections of articles that need research and work.  My guess is, if more people who wanted to be dungeonmasters left, and more Wikipedians focused on researching and writing articles, then the prestige of Wikipedia would continue to climb.  And yes, i do see problems with the encyclopedia - but more politics will definitely not addrss those problems. <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 01:12, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>I disagree to the highest degree. Wikipedia is not broken - wikipedia content grows everyday and articles improve at an astounding rate. Wikipedia has the best coverage on the entire web of all sorts of obscure but important content. Secondly even if wikipedia were broken introducing strong leadership would be the opposite of a solution. Wikipedias strength is that people can volunteer and add what they feel like when they feel like it - we are benefitting from peoples free time and their personal interests - this is the only reason wikipedia has as much content as it has. Introducing strong leadership a la Rootology would convert an idealistic volunteer project into its opposite - and would have no chance of succeeding. if I wanted to work writing for someone else I&#39;d go to somewhere where I&#39;d get paid. If we have a problem its too much leadership and bureaucracy! POV pushers I can handle, content disputes I can handle - but mobs of arrogant admins who think their tools grant them special importance and psychic powers I cannot. <a href="" title="User:Maunus">·Maunus·&#60;span class=&#34;Unicode&#34;&#62;ƛ&#60;/span&#62;·</a> 15:06, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Disagree</b>, especially and particularly with the statement that &#34;nothing ever gets done&#34;. I can assure you that, thanks to the efforts of ordinary people (we call them &#39;editors&#39;), <i>every single day</i> new articles are added to the encyclopedia while existing articles are expanded and improved. <i>Every single day</i>, good articles are made better, vandalism is deleted, new references are added and bad references are removed. These activites are the one and only purpose of this project. And because millions of ordinary people have come here to write, improve, and maintain high-quality articles, <i>every single day</i> this encyclopedia gets better. <a href="" title="User:Doc Tropics">Doc</a> &#60;font color =&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Doc Tropics">Tropics</a>&#60;/font &#62; 05:02, 19 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think it is possible to get confused by hanging too long around Wikipedia&#39;s most controversial areas, dispute resolution and WP space pages into thinking that Wikipedia is in fact broken, when large parts of it work very well. Ironically the bits which work best have the least level of bureaucracy, not the most. <a href="" title="User talk:Orderinchaos">Orderinchaos</a> 06:09, 19 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>It&#39;s true that there are hundreds, maybe thousands or even millions of articles which have some issue of compliance with policy. But the problem is that one person&#39;s &#34;policy problem&#34; is another person&#39;s &#34;not a policy problem.&#34; For instance, I think there&#39;s a synthesis problem in <a href="" title="Cheeseburger">Cheeseburger</a>. Someone else raised the issue on the original research noticeboard and it looks like nobody gives a damn enough to deal with it. Does this mean Wikipedia is &#34;broken&#34;? No. I just think that you have a large reader-edited website here that operates on &#34;consensus,&#34; and the consensus of people looking at that noticeboard is that there is no problem. Similarly, it seems that the latest consensus is that this advisory committee should not exist. --<a href="" title="User:JohnnyB256">JohnnyB256</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:JohnnyB256">talk</a>) 16:27, 25 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ol>

<dd>That page wasn&#39;t even created until the approval poll was nearly complete.  It&#39;s nice of VoA to contribute of course, and if he plans to finish it, even better.  But as I said, the proposal that people voted on was apparently created by people who were either unaware of or undeterred by the fact that it would require software changes to implement.  That&#39;s simply the reality.  I&#39;m not trying to make a judgment about whether that reality is good or bad.  I brought it up simply because a number of people have been surprised that the poll didn&#39;t result in more immediate action.  <a href="" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dragons flight">talk</a>) 12:23, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>I totally don&#39;t get the &#34;Wikipedia is functionally broken. Nothing ever gets done&#34; type of argument. What do you mean by broken? We are a website dedicated to writing an encyclopedia. The encyclopedia is being written, at a rate of dozens of articles a day, vandals are being blocked, and the website still runs. As far as I am concerned, Wikipedia works just fine and the work that matters is being done. Maybe the solution to any perceived problems is less wikipoliticking and more content writing? &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Sandstein">&#60;font style=&#34;color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;&#34;&#62;<b>&#38;nbsp;Sandstein&#38;nbsp;</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 06:45, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Root, hopefully you know how much I appreciate your efforts, and admire the things you&#39;ve done.  There have been <i>a LOT</i> of &#34;proposals&#34; and discussions lately on things that could be changed for the better.  From the separation of Jimbo and ArbCom, to the Civility poll, to &#34;The future&#34;, to &#34;Paid editing&#34; ... well, let&#39;s just say there have been a <b>LOT</b> of those kinds of discussions lately.  It&#39;s easy for frustration creep in, when things don&#39;t change overnight.  Please don&#39;t let that cloud your judgment of the the good things that WP has going for it as well.  The very fact that we <i>have</i> these discussions, out in the open, speaks volumes.  We&#39;re growing as a community, maturing as a project - and just like a living breathing person, sometimes we need to look for &#34;new clothes&#34; when the old ones don&#39;t fit anymore.  It&#39;s not always best to just &#34;buy what&#39;s on sale&#34;, sometimes it helps to shop around a bit.  Just a thought. — &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #000000;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;&#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:Ched Davis">Ched</a>&#60;/b&#62; : <a href="" title="User_talk:Ched Davis">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#FFFFFF;background:#0000fa;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;?&#38;nbsp;&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 21:11, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<li><i>As far as I am concerned, Wikipedia works just fine and the work that matters is being done.</i> No, editors are just fine until they get run over by POV pushers or officious enforcers who congregate at obscure noticeboards or trolls or the admins who blindly support any of these perps. No, Wikipedia isn&#39;t working well at all when that happens, and it happens too often. We don&#39;t do such a hot job of protecting people who have BLP articles, either, and anybody can see more nasty embarassments coming when the next scandal of that type pops up in the news media, yet again. This is what I can think of off the top of my head, but I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more. -- <a href="" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Noroton">talk</a>) 03:22, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>I don&#39;t feel I can endorse this statement as a whole. Wikipedia has its problems, but I don&#39;t yet see it as functionally broken. Also Jimbo &#34;putting his foot down&#34; or &#34;militant action&#34; are probably the last things we need. The issues facing Wikipedia are varied and complicated, we need rushed reactions even less than we need the permanent deadlock of whole community discussion. This think tank approach seems to strike a good balance.</p>
<p>I would <b>strongly endorse</b> The Fat Man&#39;s comment though. <a href="" title="User:the wub">the wub</a> <a href="" title="User_talk:The wub">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;&#34;?!&#34;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 10:06, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>While I largely agree that we need to do something - an invitation only ArbCom centred think-tank is not a good idea.  I accept what Rootology says because as a project our disciplinary system is broken.  But there is another solution. We have a number of very obvious and very serious problems (eg ideologically driven editing &#38; tendentious editing) which we basically tolerate.  We need to start remembering that this is a web-community and that we need to ban certain people and we need them to stay banned.  Just because we throw someone out doesn&#39;t mean we&#39;re not the encyclopedia that anyone can edit - it just means that terms and conditions apply.--<a href="" title="User:Cailil">&#60;font color=&#34;#999999&#34; size=&#34;2&#34;&#62;<b>Cailil</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>  &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Cailil">&#60;font color=&#34;#999999&#34;&#62;<b>talk</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 18:43, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Whether an elected think tank would come up with different views than the ACPD is absolutely irrelevant.  The ACPD clearly suffers from several credibility problems.  Different members of the ACPD and ArbCom do not agree on what the purpose of the ACPD is.  We do not know the criteria used to select the members.  There are obvious conflict of interest problems when this supposedly independent group was selected by the ArbCom.  There is an even bigger COI when members of ArbCom are also members of the ACPD.  When both of these contradict the original purpose statement of the ACPD saying it was to be an independent body, the very purpose statement lacks credibility. </li></ol>


<ul>
<li>And members of the ACPD are already blatantly ignoring views of concerned editors.  Some have quite clearly said they will ignore concensus that opposes the existence of the ACPD.  I’m still waiting for anyone from ACPD or ArbCom to address the questions I raised on 7/12 – Flonight is the only member to reply, and even then my concerns were not answered.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li>Only one member of the ACPD, Jooperscoopers, has thought the views of concerned editors were important enough to address on the ACPD forum. On 7/11 they suggested elections, saying “We are already taking some considerable flak for the rather arbitrary and unaccountable way we have been selected.”  <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development/Forum#Elections" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development/Forum#Elections"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development/Forum#Elections" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development/Forum#Elections">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development/Forum#Elections</a></a>  Most of ACPD disagreed with the idea of elections.  On 7/15 Jooperscoopers said “I&#39;m still uneasy with ignoring the community in this way and the perception of our illegitimacy is becoming hard to ignore.”  The only reply they received was “Again, my view is that the more illegitimate this Council is, the better.”</li></ul>


<ul>
<li>On 7/17 Jooperscoopers asked “Ok. Elections may not be the solution right now, let me rephrase the question - are we going to do anything now to attempt to allay the strong community objections that are being voiced? If we&#39;re just going to blithely ignore it, you can count me out. If I feel the urge, I might go through the RfC this weekend and quantify and categorise the objections to see what we&#39;re dealing with, I agree some is hyperbolic, but there is some substance there, burying our heads in the sand, ignoring public outcries and arrogantly proceeding in the face of strong objections is one of the things I&#39;ve complained about in the past of others, and I don&#39;t feel I can join their ranks - this needs addressing in some way.”</li></ul>


<ul>
<li>It was not.  On 7/19 Jooperscoopers added “I think the din of community outrage will make any meaningful work here difficult to accomplish unless this is dealt with. I&#39;m going to mark myself as inactive until such time as we are ready to discuss it.”</li></ul>

<ol>
<li>Cas, you&#39;re asking straw-man type questions here, which serves no purpose. I&#39;ll post here what I posted on your talk page. I can&#39;t guess what an elected group would differ on, because I have no idea what the people you invited think is wrong, and that is part of the problem. The point is that the ArbCom is acting beyond its remit. It was elected to resolve disputes, nothing more. In fact, this particular ArbCom was expressly elected as a backlash against the previous ArbCom appearing to assume too much authority. Good governance can&#39;t simply be a goal. It has to be a practice and a state of mind too. Here, now, we have a chance to show that we respect good governance, not only in principle, not only for the future, and not only when it&#39;s convenient. If such a think-tank is to exist, it needs to be entirely separated from the ArbCom, the candidates must say what they want to achieve, and then they must stand for election. &#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:SlimVirgin">SlimVirgin</a>&#60;/font&#62; &#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:SlimVirgin|talk">SlimVirgin|talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;pink&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/SlimVirgin">contribs</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 03:57, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Per SlimVirgin: Even if the two groups came up with the exact same list, an elected group&#39;s priorities would be made known during the election process, which makes a radical difference. <a href="" title="User:Nifboy">Nifboy</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nifboy">talk</a>) 04:19, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>A think-tank&#39;s purpose is not simply to define problems. Its purpose to suggest solutions. Different groups of editors would propose radically different solutions to the same problem. You can&#39;t argue that this group of editors is as good as any other so we may as well stick with it. It&#39;s critically important who is on the panel. If the previous ArbCom were sitting instead of the current one, would it reach exactly the same decisions as you do? Besides, I don&#39;t think the discussion should move towards who should be on the council when we haven&#39;t yet agreed whether it should exist at all. I don&#39;t think it should. At least, not until it has been given very clear terms of reference--<a href="" title="User:MoreThings">MoreThings</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:MoreThings">talk</a>) 12:18, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>A properly constituted group with legitimacy to fulfil its own aims would either be more broadly representative, or bring in valuable external feedback, or both. (It&#39;s worth noting that in Australia, Constitutional Conventions convened to discuss questions of public importance usually include a mix of elected and appointed members, with the appointed minority providing particular representation hard to get with a democracy or particular viewpoints/expertise considered necessary to assist the determinations.) As CC&#39;s are also talking shops and their proposals are only considered, not necessarily implemented, by the govt of the day they are probably the best parallel in the real world to this innovation. Most of the names I see on there, I see on AN/I every second day - they have a very particular view of the Wikiworld which the great majority of volunteers have no stake in and their perception of issues may well be very different to a content editor or an expert in the field (as in, someone who advises on this stuff for companies and non-profits and the like with a degree in it.) <a href="" title="User talk:Orderinchaos">Orderinchaos</a> 21:12, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree with Slim and MoreThings. (though with all due respect to the appointed Councilors as established and experienced Wikimedians, I must admit I find it hard to believe the community would elect a Councilor who isn&#39;t active on this project and has barely made 500 edits in the last two years and I guess that&#39;s actually the point of these appointments - the community isn&#39;t smart enough to consider recommendations and appoint their own members so it&#39;s got to be imposed by people who apparently know better.) <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 00:50, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>They&#39;d probably come up with fairly similar lists. As per my previous comments, the difference would be that ideas coming from a council seen as having some legitimacy (whether it be elected, a delegate from each active project, or even an open-to-everyone free for all) would be taken more seriously than those same ideas coming from a self-appointing clique. As currently constituted, this effectively creates an in-house version of Wikipedia Review, which again often comes up with good ideas that aren&#39;t taken seriously due to the source.&#38;nbsp;–&#38;nbsp;&#60;font color=&#34;#E45E05&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Iridescent">iride</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#C1118C&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Iridescent">scent</a>&#60;/font&#62; 10:55, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>What DGG said. By the way, when coming up with proposals is the farthest extent of the group&#39;s powers, democracy is not only irrelevant, it actually may be counterproductive. We don&#39;t have a democracy on Wikipedia, anyway. We have a mixed system of autocracy and anarchy, spiced with democracy when it comes to a few elections.

<p>I think many if not most of the problems here are fairly clear. So it wouldn&#39;t matter too much how the group was selected. But the value from a group like this would come from crafting solutions away from the noise that kind of discussion usually generates with lot&#39;s of people all talking at once. So in order to be effective (in proposing solutions) they should be elected/selected by the community in order to have some buy-in up front.  As far as the current proposed membership and your second question, some of the current members attitudes are so bad that this idea is sunk before it had a chance to show any value at all. Some really poor choices were made when inviting editors to participate. There&#39;s a significant amount of venom, over the top rhetoric and disrespect already coming from some members of the group, enough that they are already way too polarizing to be of any use.  <a href="" title="User:RxS">RxS</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:RxS">talk</a>) 04:07, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>Per SlimVirgin. I don&#39;t think it matters right now if a community&#39;s choice of editors would have radically different views, because that isn&#39;t the issue at stake. Many people&#39;s objections to this Advisory Group are not that they disapprove of such a committee at all, but rather they disagree with <i>ArbCom</i>&#60;nowiki&#62;&#39;&#60;/nowiki&#62;s right to create it. Even if such a group chosen by the community would have to be elected (which I think, for things like these, might actually be somewhat of a bad idea), the community could do some sort of system where it elects independent electors for this group, or something like that. &#60;font color=&#34;navy&#34;&#62;<b><a href="" title="User:NuclearWarfare">NW</a>&#60;/font&#62;</b> <i>(&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:NuclearWarfare">Talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;)</i> 04:58, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>Coming at this from a slightly different angle, what would the effect be of electing &#34;members&#34;? I suppose my reservation would be that this would elevate an informal talking shop to a formal status which was never really contemplated and which would probably politicise the thing far more than is necessary. The idea was only ever to act as a conduit for ideas, and to explore where they went. I supported the idea of inviting a core of editors simply as a way of giving it enough critical mass to be viable from the off. Of course, once it was set up and running, it could go into whatever direction it chose. &#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Roger Davies">&#60;span style=&#34;color:maroon; font-variant:small-caps&#34;&#62;<b>Roger&#38;nbsp;Davies</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Roger Davies"><b>talk</b></a>&#60;/sup&#62; 07:02, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>That&#39;s also true. My basic issue with this is that some very poor choices were made when assembling the group. Don&#39;t know how to get around that. I think what I&#39;d do is to call for volunteers and randomly assign them (via lottery) to 2 or 3 groups (maybe 5 or 6 members each) and let them bite off smaller chunks. Or maybe just one group that&#39;s filled by a lottery of interested editors. <a href="" title="User:RxS">RxS</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:RxS">talk</a>) 03:56, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Well, the folks I have the biggest issue with have no problem being heard. It just seems to me that this is a good idea that&#39;ll be hamstrung by the selection of some pretty polarizing members.

<dd>I agree with Slim, these are strawman questions.  Let&#39;s be honest about what is going on here.  A few years ago jimbo appointed a task force to deal with the problems of on-and off-Wiki harassment.  That task force ended up being ineffective, for a variety of reasons.  Now Jimbo is using ArbCom as a screen to create another task force, but without brief.  As far as i am concerned this task force will do even worse than the first one, because of who is one it and because of its vague brief.  There are problems facing Wikipedia, and if Jimbo wants to create a task force to address them that is his perogative, but so far our experience with his task forces do not make us confident in his ability to manage this well.  As far as i am concerned the one idea Jimbo has had that has worked was his most important idea: an encyclopedia anyone can edit at any time.  I do not think the alternative to his appointed task forces is one <i>elected</i> by the community.  I suggest members of the community be encouraged to create forums - essay-like spacs where interested people can gather, discuss problems of shared concern, and generate policy proposals.  I wouldn&#39;t dictate the number of forums, the issues they address, or who whould be active at any given forum.  Let them evolve naturally.  When they generate policy proposals, schedule time for debate and publicize the hell out of them.  I see no need for any more3 structured or durable governance than this, and i am convinced this process will generate better ideas than any appointed task force. <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 01:22, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>Not to be contrary, but quite genuinely, I want no part in an elected position and if asked to run for such a position would turn it down. Occasionally I have what I think are good ideas or more efficient ways to run something here or there. I have no problem passing along good ideas to people who are receptive to them, but it does not seem worth it to go through a charade such as what many RfAs turn into just to pass along what I think are good ideas. If this advisory committee morphs into a representative system of some kind, I won&#39;t be against it. I&#39;m all for democracy where appropriate. One of my good ideas is to appoint a minority number of members who either refuse to run or clearly would epic fail an election, just so they can voice their opinion. --<a href="" title="User:Moni3">Moni3</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Moni3">talk</a>) 12:15, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_Danaman5">Statement by Danaman5</span></h2>

<p>I see a lot of statements here expressing concerns over how Arbcom unilaterally established this advisory council without consultation, and I agree with those concerns.  However, let&#39;s not let our procedural objections stop us from considering the idea in principle. I think that there should be a full community discussion on this possibility. If most people believe that a think tank for solutions to project governance issues is a bad idea in any form, then the discussion will bear that out. However, if there is a way that this proposal can be separated from Arbcom and gain the community&#39;s support, it might have value after all.--<a href="" title="User:Danaman5">Danaman5</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Danaman5">talk</a>) 17:47, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>I&#39;m left wondering: Without &#34;community support&#34; ... how <i>much</i> of a community will there be left <i>to</i> govern.  Many folks may not see this small sub-set of editors as any governing body <i>right now</i>; but, when an small elite group of people, (not chosen by, and unsupported by, the community as a whole), start &#34;advising&#34; how established policies and guidelines should be interpreted, defining agendas, and deciding what &#34;our&#34; project development should be - I&#39;m sorry, the whole &#34;Power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely&#34; phrase jumps to the forefront of my thoughts.  As Danman5 says, there may be legs for some type of &#34;Council&#34;, but if they fail to listen to what the community is saying, I&#39;m not going to have much faith in any &#34;advice&#34; they may have to offer.

<li>Endorse, noting my own stated position that such a body should contain expertise which is external to Wikimedia, which has the dual benefits of getting in advice for ArbCom and the community on project governance and development matters which is useful and best-practice, and at the same time distancing the new body from existing Wikipolitics and factions. The *idea* is fine, *this construction* of it is not, and I&#39;d be sad to see the impetus for change killed by the death of a dumb/unconstitutional proposal. <a href="" title="User talk:Orderinchaos">Orderinchaos</a> 20:54, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>As I&#39;ve said elsewhere, I don&#39;t have a problem with the idea of such a group per se but I object to it being forced on us by ArbCom. I would be most delighted if the architects of this Council would start a community discussion elsewhere so we can consider this in the normal way rather than trying to ram it through as a done deal.  <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 01:09, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Yes - I will state (again) that I abstained from supporting the proposal for ACPD, and also that I feel the scaling issues mean there has to be <i>some</i> form of organized think-tanking. I also thank OIC for pointing out the (now blindingly-obvious) possibility of elected and appointed think-tank members.

<li>In general I like the think-tank/advisory council/whatever one might call it idea. I think there is too much objection to the ArbCom created group as it currently exists for it to be effective (though I&#39;m pretty much fine with the current membership), however I think a communal discussion, possibly heavily clerked/circumscribed, could produce something similar and with a lot more support.

<li>As I said above, there is no reason why any legitimate interest group cannot form an invited think tank - to operate transparently within WP space - and forward any derived ideas to whatever authority is capable of deliberating upon them. Too much is being made of the appearance of a possible/potential extension of ArbCom&#39;s powers by members of same putting the idea forward. <a href="" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:LessHeard vanU">talk</a>)</li></ol>

<p>This advisory committee may be a good idea. It may not be a good idea. I can&#39;t say for certain, and it really ought to be under more community scrutiny than it received when first proposed. Arbcom may or may not do good for Wikipedia with added control over governance. There still is no effective or reliable method of resolving disputes over content, and pointless, wasteful arguments continue to occur every day.</p>

<li>Obviously worth saying, and it&#39;s also worth saying that, if we end up with something akin to a functional &#34;advisory council,&#34; there should be a decent number of non-navel gazing types on it (most of the folks I see on it now tend to be somewhat to very active in community discussions which is fine, because of course we want those kind of folks there too). Any thinktank or council worth its salts should have editors from quiet corners of the &#39;pedia who&#39;ve never dropped a comment on AN/I or at an ArbCom case.

<p>I also can&#39;t imagine how creating a page for people to <b>publicly</b> advise ArbCom is worse than our current system, in which individual ArbCom members are forced to ask for advice secretly (because there&#39;s simply no other way to do it).  If ArbCom wants new ideas, or wants outside opinions from people they trust, then why not have that happen on a page that we can all watch, instead of in e-mail messages or in quiet little corners where nobody notices?  This proposal creates <i>more</i> transparency, not less.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_Hammersoft:_The_editor_is_the_highest_Wikipedian">Statement by Hammersoft: The editor is the highest Wikipedian</span></h2>
<p>There is an increasing trend of belief that administrators, checkusers, oversighters, bureaucrats, arbitrators, rollbackers and more are all chain of command type positions, with increasing authority and respect. This undermines Wikipedia. The editor is the highest Wikipedian, and EVERYone is first an editor. Any additional responsibilities are just that; additional responsibilities. The additional responsibilities do not confer greater rights or authority. Even an ArbCom member has no independent authority greater than a beginning editor. Their authority comes through ArbCom, not themselves. </p>

<p>This ArbCom has been creating a considerable amount of bureaucracy. There&#39;s a new audit subcommittee, this advisory council, and a new ban appeal subcommittee. All of these are new with this ArbCom. The creation of bureaucracy without a strong, demonstrable need is an extremely strong negative. ArbCom should be prevented from creating additional bureaucracy without community input and consensus. ArbCom works at the behest of the community, not the other way around. </p>

<li>I dislike &#34;oppose&#34; statements in RfCs, but this deserves explicit rejection:  ArbCom should be, and IMO must be, empowered to create whatever structures are necessary for it to get its real job done.  The goal is &#34;do the job&#34;, <b>not</b> &#34;do the job, while every member is holding hands, moving in unison, duplicating each other&#39;s efforts, and never, <i>ever</i> specializing or using this 18th-century innovation called <a href="" title="division of labor">division of labor</a> to produce the same outcome more efficiently.&#34;  Their workload has increased.  If they can assign a couple of people to Common Task X and a couple of people to Common Task Y, and get the same results with half the labor, then they should definitely do so.  I add, for those interested in transparency, that ArbCom has, like any functional team, done exactly this for years:  the recent innovation is merely formalizing it and telling the rest of us who usually takes the lead in which steps.  <a href="" title="User:WhatamIdoing">WhatamIdoing</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:WhatamIdoing">talk</a>) 20:50, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>The new subcommittees are not new bureaucracy, but merely reorganizing the old bureaucracy so it works more smoothly. Which is the whole point of any bureaucracy-to help things run more smoothly.

<li>Precisely so. Repeatable process is perceived as, and <i>is</i> fairer, or at least more consistent, than adhoc action.

<li>Afraid I have to chime in here as well - the above statement is far too sweeping and essentially shackles ArbCom from executing the various responsibilities we have heaped upon them. The entire point of the Arbitration process is to take it just a little outside of standard consensus gauging systems - cases are decided by majority vote, not by consensus of committee and/or the wiki as a whole. Much of the additional structures created are in fact trying to bring ArbCom <i>back</i> to its core dispute resolution function. For example, the Audit Subcommittee (of which I am a member) is responsible for CU/OS oversight, lessening the responsibility ArbCom has over a userright that wasn&#39;t even in real use when the committee was created! Limited bureaucracies are sometimes needed - what we avoid is bureaucracy created for its own sake, not all semblance of formal structure. Its good to be a little suspicious and skeptical - but its also good to be willing to let what is necessary happen. --<a href="" title="User:Tznkai">Tznkai</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Tznkai">talk</a>) 15:43, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<ol>
<li>Mainly to respond to the statement further up from Rootology that wikipedia is broken and failing. I do not accept this, as in my perspective the encyclopedia (the most important thing and what we are here for) is getting better not worse as time goes by. Wikipedia is not perfect by any means, but very few things are; while some articles can get worse for a period, the general trend is of improvement. The easiest way to make wikipedia fail is to make poor changes that drive editors to no longer want to contribute to wikipedia, and discourage new editors from starting to contribute. This is not a &#34;no change is needed&#34; view (my personal opinion has long been that flagged revisions are a good idea), but that there is no fundamental failure currently and we should not be basing things on the premise that wikipedia is failing. <a href="" title="User:Davewild">Davewild</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Davewild">talk</a>) 18:38, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>I&#39;m not here to save a failing project, but to deal with the inevitable transitions as the project has grown, and to find what is necessary to encourage it to grow further. Some parts of the project I think do not work very well, but the basic goal of writing  encyclopedia articles does work, does continue, and is far from finished.  <b><a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> (<a href="" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a>) 06:17, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>It&#39;s don&#39;t believe Wikipedia itself is failing.  Some of the processes of Wikipedia which either worked in the past or were less important when Wikipedia merited less attention seem to be noticeably failing now.  I expect Wikipedia will adapt no matter what, but I think a focused effort will lead to solutions emerging sooner and with less damage to Wikipedia&#39;s reputation.&#60;i&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#9966FF&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:BirgitteSB">Birgitte</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#CC99CC&#34; size=&#34;2&#34;&#62;SB&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/i&#62; 15:37, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Agree 100%.  There is not a single problem facing Wikipedia today (vandalism, trolling, uneven attention to topics, no mechanism to resolve content disputes) that did not exist in 2001 There is really only one problem, and JHK summed it up when she retired in August <b>2002</b>!! <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK</a></a>.) The very idea of a <b>wiki</b>pedia is a gamble that the more people who are empowere to edit at any time, the better the encyclopedia will be, is always a gamble because as long as we are a wiki, people will always be able to use Wikipedia to push a POV or spread slander.  If we have any problem with public confidence, the only solution is to explain to them carefully what we all know: that chosing a <b>wiki</b>pedia involves some advantages AND some disadvantages.  All this aside, I have seen great articles emerge over the years, and i know more and more academics who use Wikipedia as a resource.  Collaborating on an encyclopedia article on a controversial topic with a bunch of strangers takes infinite patience and skill at compromise, as well as time to do real research.  Editors who are unskilled at research or compromise and impatient will of course see Wikipedia as a failure and seek &#34;governance&#34; to make up for their own flaws.  I prefer to acknowledge all of my fellow editors as being as flawed as I am, but hopeful that with time we can work out good articles.  I have seen this time and time again, so far from bing a failure i see Wikipedia as a grand success. <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 01:33, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Discussion">Discussion</span></h3>
<p>Wikipedia is both doing very well and failing. The majority of high quality content to individual articles, particularly ones not in the immediate spotlight, are written by a small minority. I&#39;d venture to say probably under 100 editors. While the collaboration of copy editing and peer review is quite good and has been a helpful and growth-inducing experience for me, the actual formation of content in most articles is done by individuals. Because they have the same sources and perceptions to decide what&#39;s important and what&#39;s not, these individuals (myself included) are forming knowledge. This is not what I believe the purpose of Wikipedia to be, and as a result I have suspended my editing on certain topics. </p>
<p>When an event happens in real time, however, watching the construction of a well-cited article despite the edit conflicts is quite amazing. Although perhaps many readers come to get up on recent events, the bulk of material on Wikipedia is not current events. So community collaboration consists of unhelpful and unnecessary drive-by fact tagging, and demands that certain facts are inserted into articles and the stressful arguments that follow. Many editors function in a crisis and response type system, by swarming on an article and its talk pages, going through an edit war or nominated for AfD to improve it, to stop the leaks in a sinking boat, so to speak. Often single sentences or paragraphs are the center of these battles. Many editors do not display patience and fortitude enough to step back and reconstruct the article from the bottom up, and I notice that if information is not immediately available within a 10-second search on Google, further attempts are sometimes abandoned. A culture of intellectual laziness is associated with this atmosphere. I quite honestly believe that Wikipedia culture and its systems (consensus, dispute resolution, ANI, etc) are built upon solving or avoiding arguments that spiral out of control despite the fact that few editors bother to read multiple sources. Editors would rather argue for days on a fine point than go read about the whole topic and provide a variety of sources and views, like arguing over a broken window in a house collapsing over your head.</p>
<p>Ideally, in my opinion, editors should be using high quality content as a guide to create more high quality material. What is this, incrementalism or some kind of ism where quality theoretically increases in increments? I don&#39;t know how true this is. I do know that I often find articles shamefully lacking in quality and full of all kinds of nuttiness so I construct them myself. It is, however, impossible for a handful of editors to continue to do this. I wonder even if a graphic model could be made of how many FAs or GAs it takes before a single editor is overcome with maintenance problems and unable to branch out to tackle other topics. For high traffic articles, that number is very low, such as 5 articles or so. For more obscure topics, the number is higher. While individual ownership is not a right, the community has the responsibility to support high quality, and I don&#39;t find it widely done. Individually, I&#39;m left alone to write what I want as long as I stick to GA and FA guidelines. It&#39;s something I enjoy doing, so that&#39;s pretty cool. Collectively, however, the effort to maintain articles is sorely lacking. --<a href="" title="User:Moni3">Moni3</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Moni3">talk</a>) 20:51, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Moni sums it up well, and my encounters of articles parallel hers - yes it isn&#39;t &#39;failing&#39; as such and superficially continues to impress as a vibrant and thriving community with oodles of discussion. I agree that I frequently find precious little article development other than reverting, and many remain in a half-done state for years. Furthermore, there is some evidence of a fall-off in recruitment of editors, which should concern everyone. Many people only stick around for a certain period and we should be grateful for that, and not expect them to continue the input indefinitely. Other issues such as BLPs and legal issues, things may be fine....until they are not.

<dd>Thanks EricBarbour below, I only read the conclusion section but it was an interesting read. Has this dissertation been raised or discussed anywhere else on wikipedia before? I know the stagnation of new editors has been raised before but I would be interested in reading a discussion on this. My initial thought, and again the comments above reinforce this, was that I hope the <a class="externallink" href="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/StantonGrantQA" rel="nofollow" title="http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/StantonGrantQA">foundation usability project</a> produces results that will lead to more new editors being able to contribute. I also think it reinforces what I said above about not driving off our existing editors or discouraging new editors. <a href="" title="User:Davewild">Davewild</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Davewild">talk</a>) 17:31, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>I do not think that credentials matter here - but the fact is, there is a tremendous overlap between those editors who are skilled at library research, and those who are pursuing or have academic degrees.  And it is from this group that Wikipedia draws the authors of most of the best articles on scholarly topics.  Yet these are people who have to be devoting their time to their own original research to advance in their careers.  The point is this: given that Wikipedia depends entirely on voluntary labor, it is extraordinary htat it has so many great articles as it has!  I think when one considers such realities Wikipedia clearly is a success.  Now, is it perfect?  No.  We could use a mechanism for resolving ontent disputes.  We need to attract more people from the social sciences and humanities.  We need to educate many volunteer editors how to use the wb skillfully in research, and when they need to rely on real libraries.  The project council is not going to help solve any of these problems.  Lt&#39;s create open forums where editors can discuss such problems, and lets see if we can generate any proposals.  in the meantime, for an encyclopedia that asks strangers to collaborate on writing articles, often on controverisal topics, without any compensation, I&#39;d say Wikipedia is a smashing success. <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 01:40, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I read the article. It is extremely interesting. But my take on it is that the potential reasons  for the drop off in new editors who remain active are not particularly issues that this ACPD committee will address. &#34;Editor retention&#34; is complex, I deduce from this dissertation. It also mentions the serious problem of a core number of editors are doing an increasing amount of work, and casual editors a lesser proportion, and if this trend continues, it will not be feasible to maintain a thriving Wikipedia due to human limitations in work load. Will this committee be addressing the needs of new editors and casual editors, or the needs of the small percentage of hardcore contributors? The English Wikipeida has the oldest editors (I&#39;m not putting this elegantly), according to the dissertation. The future lies in attracting and retaining new editors and casual editors, not only catering primarily  to the old hands. &#38;mdash;<a href="" title="User:Mattisse">&#60;font color=&#34;navy&#34;&#62;<b>Mattisse</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mattisse">Talk</a>) 17:37, 15 July 2009 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_John_Carter">Statement by John Carter</span></h2>
<p>Some editors, including some very respected ones, seem to believe, perhaps correctly, that there is no need for the creation of a body such as this one, and have, understandably, objected to its creation in the way it was created. A number of other editors, some very respected, disagree with them, based on their comments above and elsewhere. If for no other reason than to quiet the misgivings of those who have perceived a problem, real or imagined, it does seem logical to create an entity which is at least seen by those individuals as being able to address that problem. If there is no problem, fine, the actions or proposals of the group may well not achieve any sort of consensus to become enacted. If there is a problem, they might be able to help create a way of addressing it. But, at the very least, even by simply existing the group seems to be likely to at least maybe help some of those who feel, perhaps irrationally, that wikipedia does have problems to think there is a group which can address them. &#60;br&#62;
All prior attempts at creating similar groups in the past have been rejected. If the same means of proposing such a group were to have been used this time, the same result would probably have been gotten, specifically, the discussion would drag on for months and ultimately the proposed group would have been found to lack the consensus to be created. Knowing this, and the real or imaginary perceived problems of the project many editors see at this time, it probably makes sense, if for no other reason than to address the concerns of the maybe paranoid people who think wikipedia is failing, to create the group outright, without prior discussion and almost certain rejection on the basis of no consensus to create it. &#60;br&#62;
If the individual members of the group screw up in some big way, it is hard if not impossible to imagine that they would not be reprimanded/punished for their actions. If the group itself were to be found to be incompetent or problematic, the foundation or the community would almost certainly be able to call for its dissolution. Particularly considering it is largely made up of some of the better, more level-headed people we have, the likelihood of some such mistake being made are not necessarily particularly good. &#60;br&#62;
In summary, it looks like those individuals who have, rightly or wrongly, perceived the need for some such body now have one, although by its remit so far it cannot on its own enact any ideas it might have. That, basically, means it can&#39;t directly hurt anyone, or, for that matter, possibly/probably do anything on its own at all. And it seems to have been created in the only way, based on previous history, such a group could ever be created. While some may reasonably object to the way its existence was announced to a degree, there may have been no other way for it to be created.  Even if it is just a placebo and there is nothing wrong, it may well be enough to reduce the number of complaints that there is and make the editors making such statements feel better about the project. </p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_from_roux">Statement from <a href="" title="User:Roux">roux</a></span></h2>
<p>(This was intended as a support of John Carter&#39;s statement above, but ended up being far too long). Enough <a href="" title="Chicken Little">Chicken Littling</a>. This council was formed to cut through the nonsense that is trying to get <i>anything</i> substantial done. The deadlocks are ridiculous, the vocal opposition from people <i>who cannot even be bothered to read anything about what is going on</i> is insane, and the general antipathy towards finding any sort of solution--as opposed to endless and fruitless wrangling over comma placement--is sounding the death knell of Wikipedia as it could and should be. To paraphrase someone on another website I belong to, &#34;Hi! I&#39;m from Wikipedia and I could over-argue a plate of beans!&#34; I mean let&#39;s be serious here. Flagged Revisions, which has worked to <i>excellent</i> effect on dewiki, has been vocally opposed on enwiki for no other reason that I can see than that it represents change. A limited trial is coming.. except that the trial was decided by people who fundamentally do not understand how FR works, and will require software changes from volunteers who have other things to do with their time than to rewrite software at the behest of people don&#39;t know what they are talking about. That job is the province of developers in the corporate world. </p>
<p>This is emblematic of the problems site-wide in project administration and governance. Wikipedians, <i>en masse</i>, have an intense aversion to any sort of change. And anytime someone attempts change, they get castigated for it. <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for adminship/Ironholds 2">This</a> comes to mind; people actually opposed the candidate for trying something new instead of engaging the process on its merits. The vocal opposers here have done exactly the same thing. Instead of actually <i>paying attention to what has been said</i>, they have leapt forth, falling all over each other to be the first to demonstrate that they not only haven&#39;t read what has been said, but are actively <i>ignoring</i> what is being said in favour of reacting to their own preconceptions and furthering past grudges. This entire RFC is a perfect microcosm of exactly what is wrong with Wikipedia, and exactly why a focus group for examining problems is needed: a small and nimble discussion group can actually devote itself to examining problems, and <b>more importantly finding actual solutions to propose to the community</b>, without getting bogged down in the endless verbiage and nonsense that plague every discussion--particularly the endlessly recurring ones such as date delinking, Rorschach images, Muhammad images, etc--occurring on Wikipedia. →&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#082567;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>ROUX</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#082567;&#34;&#62;<b>₪</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;small&#62;&#38;nbsp;20:43, 14 July 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;</p>

<ol>
<li>I think the members of ArbCom who promoted this idea were trying in good faith to solve a problem, not trying to expand their powers.</li>
<li>I think the proposed Council poses little risk of becoming an elite, privileged group, and has the potential to generate a lot of good ideas and discussion.</li>
<li>I think the invitation towards various adversarial voices to sit on the council was a wise notion; I regard it to have been an effort to put aside personal squabbles in order to achieve a better diversity of views.</li>
<li>I don&#39;t agree with the strong objections that have been voiced but I respect them and hope we can find a good and close alternative that promotes well-reasoned analysis of wiki-wide concerns and minimizes feelings of inequality or classism.</li>
<li>My proposed alternative (first mentioned on this RfC&#39;s talk page, condensed here) is to establish a system of think-tanks -- not just one exclusive group, but any number of self-organizing and self-governing groups with their own chosen scope and membership -- that all have to meet some basic criteria (like making all their communications public on-wiki to avoid suspicions of cabalism).  Such qualifying think-tanks would have an ArbCom liaison to aid in communicating ideas and recommendations between them.  The roles of the think-tanks would be purely advisory, their influence determined by the merits of what they produce, and members of the think-tanks would enjoy no special prerogatives in content editing, project-space discussion, or dispute resolution processes.  Originally, I suggested that ArbCom could charter these groups to ensure adherence to the minimum standards, but perhaps there&#39;s a way for this to be self-policing or else handled by the (aware and involved subset of the) community in general.</li></ol>

<li>Per Steve, though the &#39;think tank&#39; system will still need a group overseeing it. The parallel is WikiProjects with taskforces. Expanding slightly: one of the major concerns raised is that any such groups need to be (at least) arms length from Arbcom. I don&#39;t <i>agree</i> that this is necessary, but consensus is clear on the matter. An elected group with overall responsibility for managing thinktanks will help keep the &#39;separation of powers&#39;, as well as being able to steer each group and keep them on track, and then shut it down once a proposal has made it to the community-approval stage. →&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#6D351A;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>ROUX</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#6D351A;&#34;&#62;<b>₪</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;small&#62;&#38;nbsp;04:32, 15 July 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_Slrubenstein">Statement by <a href="" title="user:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a></span></h2>
<p>According to Rootology and many others who support ArbCom&#39;s action, the &#34;system&#34; is so screwed up that it is failing and will collapse in on itself. </p>
<p>So what is the cause of this massive screw-up?  I have another view.</p>
<p>The problem is simple.  Jimbo (and by some accounts Larry Sanger) wished to create an Encyclopedia that anyone could edit at any time.  The wiki technology means not only that masses of editors could create masses of articles, it also means that masses of editors can correct one another&#39;s mistakes.  This is one of the few (if not only) attempts to create an open community on a global scale:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>Jimbo wrote a <a href="" title="User:Jimbo Wales/Statement of principles">Statement of principles</a> in 2001. It is prominently linked from <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Five pillars">Wikipedia:Five pillars</a>. This statement of principles posits, in part, that</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>Newcomers are always to be welcomed. There must be <a href="" title="There Is No Cabal">no cabal</a>, there must be no elites, there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers. [A]ny measures instituted for security must address a compelling community interest, and must be narrowly tailored to achieve that objective and no other.... [R]ather than trust humans to correctly identify &#34;regulars&#34;, we must use a simple, transparent, and open <a href="" title="algorithm">algorithm</a>, so that people are automatically given full privileges once they have been around the community for a very short period of time.</i></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>The problem is, we now have <i>millions</i> of registered editors.  We are not the small community of people working largely by consensus that we were in 2001.  We are a project of many mini-communities and strangers.  Consensus takes more work - and patience, the patience of months, not of minutes.</p>
<p>If you share Jimbo&#39;s vision, this is a success.</p>
<p>If you do not, it is a failure.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s be cystal clear about this: the fantsatic growth of Wikipedia is a &#34;problem&#34; <i>only</i> if you reject Jimbo&#39;s vision of a <i>wiki</i>pedia that <b>any</b>one can edit at any time, and that all people in the world can participate in.</p>
<p>Over time we have created policies to guide these strangers, and ArbCom, but always with some concern that too much structure would ruin Jimbo&#39;s idea.  For those with faith in Jimbo&#39;s vision, even policies are at best descriptive not prescriptive.  The ideal solution for any problem is for those editors working on an article to sort out a compromise among themselves thourgh the wiki technology.</p>
<p>So I think this comes down to a simple question: do you believe that wiki technology can make a functioning open society possible, or not.</p>
<p>If your answer is &#34;not&#34; then you will seek to create new structures to create more order here, to regulate people further.  You see &#34;wiki&#34; as a problem.  If this is your answer, you basically reject Jimbo&#39;s vision.</p>
<p>And this is not a function of scale, or the growth of Wikipedia - those who believe Wikipedia is collapsing and screwed up are not new.  People were saying such things when there were only hundreds of editors.  There is really only one problem, and JHK summed it up when she retired in August <b>2002</b><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:JHK</a></a>.) The point is, a wiki process will <i>always</i> be sloppy).  So there is nothing new about this problem, or these complaints.</p>
<p>If your answer is yes, then you will acknowledge the problems anarchy creates, but also appreciate its potential.  You will resist further structure and regulation beyond the ability for people to propose new policies and have discussions over them, or create essays on what they see as problems and open up discussion - in contrast (but with respect) to Alanyst&#39;s proposal, anyone can form a &#34;think tank&#34; at any time and share the thoughts with everyone else (the problem is not people spontaneously forming think-tnks and then sharing thir views with others; the problem is when the one formal institution we have, ArbCom, oversteps its bounds, to create its own think tank as if its think tank has any special status over that of any other group of editors).  If you answer yes, you trust in <b>wiki</b> not as a problem but as a solution, just a solution that unsettles those used to rigid structures..</p>
<p>My answer is yes.  Let us grow to 100,000,000!!  There will be more conflicts that will take longer to resolve.  But let Wiki resolve most of them.  Let new users propose new policies, write essays ... I see no need for any special fornmal commitees when we have Wiki, and anyone can do anything one wants, comfortble in the knowledge that when one makes a mistake, Wiki allows others to fix it.  I do not believe this process will collapse.  If it does, it means Jimbo&#39;s vision was wrong from the start.  I however have faith in that vision. <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 20:33, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>PS: I know many people will disagree with me in good faith.  Believe it or not, I get your point, however much I respectfully disagree.  But I have to say: if you feel this way, move to Larry Sanger&#39;s Nupedia and try to restart it (that was an experiment - in centralized governance - that really DID fail!!).  He formed Nupedia largely because he shared many of your objections and concerns.  The question is, should there be only one on-line encyclopedia?  I see no problem with there being several, each informed by different premises and having different governing structures.  If you want to be part of Wikipedia, then be part of Wilkipedia. But if you feel that the Wikipedia philosophy is wrong or has failed, do what Larry Sanger did: leave Wikipedia for a different kind of project.  <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 12:05, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>PPS: I am <i>not</i> saying that there are no problems at Wikipedia.  I am however saying that the solution (eve if it involves creating new committees) has to involve greater transparency and participation by the community.  This means creating committees only following community discussion, and chosing on membership rules (democratic elections or open memebership) through community discussion and vote.  My current project, <a href="" title="WP:Areas for Reform">WP:Areas for Reform</a> demonsrates how serious I am about addressing problems, and how committed I am to doing this through the <a href="" title="open community">open community</a>. <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 21:37, 23 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>I refer you to the <i>Questions Of Scale</i> section by Casliber above. I still love the basic idea and promise of Wikipedia. But its governing institutions and processes have simply failed to scale. I&#39;ve been saying this since 2006! Any community, once it reaches a certain size, begins to feel stresses and strains. See for yourself; put a bunch of mice together in a small cage (or ants if you prefer in a small jar) and watch the ensuing hilarity. I&#39;ve seen it happen to easily dozens of online communities over the decades ranging in size from local BBSes, Fidonet mailing lists, Web-based message forums and the Usenet. This is a fundemental social dynamic. All the <i>Wiki! Wiki! RahRahRahs!</i> and <i>Hail Jimbos!</i> can&#39;t change it.--<a href="" title="User:R.D.H. (Ghost In The Machine)">R.D.H.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Expansion_of_comment_by_Collect">Expansion of comment by Collect</span></h3>

<p>I noted several instances where the slowdown of WP expansion has been noted.  When WP started, think of the available area for articles as being a football field where editors could pretty much throw a dart and be able to edit where the dart landed without intracting much with others.  As the field fills up with darts, the probability of landing too close to another dart increases exponentially - right now there are very few areas where an editor has truly open space. WP has hit a maturity level as far as new articles is concerned - which explains why the number of non-notable articles is now increasing rapidly (if one wishes to make new articles there is an easy path -- subdivide what should be single articles. Lists of post offices in Ulan Bator can be made into an article on each post office and each postmaster, an article on &#34;The Gnarfs&#34; (putative TV series for the sake of discussion) gets subdivided into articles on every actor ever to appear, and every character ever to appear in it, and so forth.)  One other aspect is unfortunately the nature of mature projects to develop additional bureaucracies.   WP does not need to scale up any layers of bureaucracies, rather it needs to adhere more closely to the original slightly anarchic vision it was founded with.   WP has not yet &#34;failed&#34; to be sure -- everything whoich has been called a failing can be explained in a simple and rational manner, and was predictable from the start. <a href="" title="User:Collect">Collect</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Collect">talk</a>) 14:05, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>I do not believe that thirty days have passed or that consensus has been reached yet.  What I do see is a transparent discussion about Wikipedia governance.  In this discussion many people, including RDH and Lar, have expressed support for the ACPD and a desire for a shift to some kind of binding governance at Wikipedia; this is fine.  I also see many people expressing strong opposition to these views, which is fine too.  I think it is unfortunate and sad that some editors cannot stand to see people disagree with them in public.  And it seems to me that this is what is motivating this motion.  To call it madness shows a failure to <a href="" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> on the part of people who just do not agree with you.  What does it mean to call a request for people to comment on a change in Wikipedia governance &#34;disruptive?&#34;  What is this discussion disrupting?  Whom is it damaging?  Is any disagreement with your views or aims &#34;damaging disruption?&#34;  Creating a small, invitation-only council is not damaging or disruptive, but giving any editor the opportunity to comment <i>is</i>?

<dd>Yes, I understand that you disagree with those who object to the Council or the way it was established.  I am just saying that this was not a &#34;catch-22.&#34;  I think your argument, that the objections are premature judgments, is a valid argument ... nevertheless, you seem to be in the minority.  When I said &#34;that is how thing are supposed to work&#34; I was not referring to the reasonableness or unreasonableness of anyone&#39;s reasons, only to the fact that we had an open process in which anyone could participate, air their views, endorse or object to different peopl&#39;s views as they see fit.  For me, everything follows from the principle whtat Wikipedia is the encyclopedia that anyone can edit at any time.  Anyone can issue an RfC at any time.  And anyone has the right to argue that it is premature.  If most people agreed with you, this RfC would have ended many days ago when a consensus that the whole thing is premature might have emerged.  That could have happened ... in this case it just didn&#39;t.

<li>But you&#39;re shooting the messenger. You can&#39;t lay responsibility for those events at the feet of the RFC. Those things would never have come about if a) ArbCom had stuck to dispute resolution, the role it was elected to or b) ArbCom had spoken to the community before launch or c) The members of ArbCom who support this idea had doffed their ArbCom garb before bringing it forward.

<dd>As a <i>pleb</i>, then, I&#39;m curious as to why you feel the mighty Wikipedia would be so threatened by this small, mostly harmless think tank/sounding board. I can understand perfectly why the established <i>elites</i> and their cliques hate it-They see it as a threat to their sooper sekret off-wiki power channels and besides they were not invited. But the plebs should be welcoming it. If they have a clever idea or an issue or problem they feel should be addressed, then this little council gurentees they would have the eyes of several prominant <i>Pats</i> and even a couple of Arbs. At least let&#39;s give it a chance and see. Then if it should turn into just another closed, echo chamber, I&#39;m with you; it would deserve some killing.

<dd>The way it was initially created, I don&#39;t think it was a small and mostly harmless think-tank. If you read through the initial announcement on the ArbCom board you&#39;ll see my view. Why shouldn&#39;t we just stick with it as an impotent think-tank? Largely because it&#39;s an impotent think-tank. What&#39;s the point?  How is it actually going to <i>do</i> anything?

<li>The only way to end the madness is to either close the council down or reconstitute it as a &#34;group of members&#34; independent of any &#34;advisory&#34; role. If we are to appoint advisors, they need to know what they are advising on, and have experience in the sorts of things ArbCom needs advice on. If it&#39;s governance, bring in governance experts. If it&#39;s consensus building, bring in psychologists and group mentors. Otherwise, even through the best intentions of those appointed, it will fail to generate new or useful ideas.

<li>Well if it serves to curb the increasingly authoritarian style of the so called ArbCom then that is a good thing. This body, supposedly a dispute resolution committee, seems to see itself as Wikipedia&#39;s Executive Government. Now it is time for it to go, when it acts arbitrarily and decides to create patronage systems, it&#39;s members have overstepped. These RfCs are where the community gets it&#39;s say. Like typical authoritarians, whent he community doesn&#39;t agree with the executive, the instincts of the executive are to cut off debate quickly.

<dd>Er, buddy boy, when you say ArbCom is the only elected body we have, you understand that that makes ArbCom a form of <b>in</b>direct democracy.  The reason they are the only elected body we have is because the form of democracy we faor at Wikipedia is <b>direct</b> democracy.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Statement_by_Maunus">Statement by Maunus</span></h2>
<p>I do not necessarily oppose the creation of the Advisory Council. I think it is a good idea that gropus of wikipedians come together and discuss ways to improve and develop the project. But I am strongly against assigning anything more than suggestive power to such groups - all suggestions should be subject to decision by consensus. Now, this is exactly what it seems that the ArbCom is proposing should be the ground rules for the ACPD. Then my question is: why make it in this way? Why not simply encourage any and all groups of editors to go together and discuss such things in their user spaces and present their suggestins under the same proviso of decision by consensus? What other purpose does it serve that the Arbcom has a specially appointed council of their own choosing? My view is that all wikipedians have the same right to congregate and discuss improvements and to suggest such improvements in the appropriate fora. I don&#39;t see the point of having a special AbCom sanctioned council. This being said I cannot oppose the creation of the ACPD because as I have stated I belieave that all wikipedians have the rights to form councils and propose suggestions, so should the members of ArbCom and the current ACPD. But I would strongly urge that it be made explicit that the ACPD&#39;s suggestions and opinions are not apriori more important or valid than suggestions made by any other group of wikipedians. <a href="" title="User:Maunus">·Maunus·&#60;span class=&#34;Unicode&#34;&#62;ƛ&#60;/span&#62;·</a> 15:33, 18 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>We (ArbCom) share your opinion. Every idea will need to be implemented the same way as always. The hope is that the discussions will be different in the sense that they will be better researched and better informed because the group has people invited to talk to each other that generally do not join the same discussions (at least at the same time.) For example, getting content contributors in discussion with users that are involved with the technical side of contributing will help find better solutions to issues. People that have good knowledge and skills at with doing research can offer to develop quality information that can be used by other people when designing new policies and processes. Currently, when complicated ideas are suggested there is a rush of people that start !voting based on first impressions or anecdotal experience. I prefer that we move towards models for addressing complex issues by using the process that are usually used by large and thriving organizations. The intent is not to limit the involvement of anyone. But rather give everyone a better chance of having their ideas heard and implemented if they are the best one. Currently many ideas die on the vine from lack of nurturing.  This think tank is intended to be a model of how good decision making takes place. <a href="" title="User:FloNight">FloNight</a><a href="" title="User talk:FloNight">&#38;#9829;&#38;#9829;&#38;#9829;</a> 15:49, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<ul>
<li><b>1. Failure to launch.</b> It is 7 days since the ACPD &#39;launched&#39;, and the launch appears to have been a failure, as the group does not currently have the support of a significant portion of the community.</li>
<li><b>2. Failure to lead.</b> Since it has been launched, the ACPD still seems to have no leadership, or any idea what is it for, despite numerous clear clarifications from arbitrators, and encouragement from users. The group is suffering from lack of leadership and purpose, and a recent incident suggest this forum suffers from some of the same problems that supposedly dogs full community discussion </li>
<li><b>3. Failure to overcome.</b> Follwing the launch, the ACPD has failed to capitalise on the actual support it has for just getting on with being a think tank, and neither has it satisfactoraly begun to fix what some people think is fundementally wrong with it. It is caught in the headlights. The group discussions and organisation so far, while at an extremely early stage, is not what you would expect from a focused think tank of experienced users.</li>
<li><b>4 Reboot from first principles.</b> An arbcom invite only think tank for the benefit of brainstorming problems and presenting proposals is not necessarily a bad thing, but the failures and mistakes launching this one have holed it below the waterline. Any proposal from the ACPD may be forever stained by its conception, so simply pressing on and hoping for the best is admirable, but most likely self-defeating. As a fresh start, a new group should be established building on the existing support for ACPD, but with clearer legitimacy and functional specification. As such, please see <a href="#Proposal_-_Wikipedia_Think_Tank_.28WP:TT.29" title="" /> below.</li></ul>

<li>Whether we have the support of the community is an entirely different matter, but the program hasn&#39;t been a failure, even with all the retirements, et al. We&#39;ve had to slog through all the problems this RfC has created, but now we are drafting issue briefs which, if nothing else good comes from the program, should be a valuable source of information. The real world doesn&#39;t operate as some on the wiki seem to believe it does; people have real life and other onwiki commitments, so it&#39;s been slow-going, but this is akin to blaming Obama for not fixing the economy in a month of taking office. --&#60;font color=&#34;#cc6600&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:David Fuchs">Der Wohltemperierte Fuchs</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; &#60;nowiki&#62;(&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;small&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#993300&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;nowiki&#62;)&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 15:10, 19 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

ArbCom is an elected body to arbitrate disputes.  That is the only decision it has to make. Why would it need a council on how to decide in personal behavior disputes?  The ONLY people who should be influencing ArbCom decisions are ... people elected to ArbCom!!

<p>Based on <a href="#The_ACPD_is_an_initial_failure_but_has_potential.2C_reboot" title="">my statement</a>, specifically point 4, the ACPD will be disbanded, and the community will reconstitute it as the Wikipedia Think Tank (WP:TT), based on the first principles laid out below. These are based on, but are an enhancement of, the current ACPD, taking into account this Rfc and the progress of the ACPD in its first week.</p>
<p>Having Arbcom handling invites is as good a system as any given their community standing, but they were not appointed to make policy, so they should not be members of the think tank. Any form of community elected think tank brings its own big issues, and as such should be presented as a different proposal to this one. If people genuinely want an elected body instead of the ACPD, please do not support this proposal.</p>
<p>The ACPD was never conceived as a decision making body, and would have no power to change policy, so a simple indicative weight of support from the community is enough, rather than any more onerous idea of a counted consensus such as 60% or even 75% of a &#39;vote&#39;. </p>

<li>What it is:

<li>The group <i>is</i> a think tank, nothing more, nothing less</li>
<li>The group works for the communty, not arbcom</li></ol></li>
<li>What it is not:

<li>The group is not an elite/Wikipedia government/special friends club/bitching forum</li>
<li>The group is not a community decision making body</li>
<li>The group is not part of the dispute resolution process</li>
<li>The group is not exempt from any community policies</li></ol></li>
<li>Why it is:
<ol>
<li>The group exists to allow for focussed discussion on specific issues, clear of the problems of scale produced the much enlarged community model</li>
<li>The group exists to formulate and present proposals to the community</li>
<li>The group exists to bring together the often diverse views of the community, not force through unsupported proposals against consensus</li></ol></li>
<li>Setting up the membership:

<li>Arbitrators are not members of the think tank, input or direction from arbcom/arbitrators to the group must be through an approved method of the chairperson</li>
<li>Each membership &#39;seat&#39; is offered by invitation only, and only after a majority decision by arbcom</li>
<li>The criteria used to invite members is published before invitations go out</li>
<li>The status of an invitee is to be presumed private, unless or until accepted</li>
<li>Self nominations are allowed, but they must also meet the published criteria, and are only accepted by arbcom majority vote</li></ol></li>
<li>Maintaining the group
<ol>
<li>The membership will appoint an impartial chair, who will set the agenda as he/she sees fit</li>

In fact, the ArbCom should not be doing anything other than deciding cases -- meaning, for example, that they should have nothing to do with oversighting and checkuser, either.

<li>Weakly oppose. With a limited and restricted membership, any proposal along these lines will suffer from the same problems that beset Esperanza, in that it will become a &#34;power users&#34; group whether or not it&#39;s intended to. I could weakly support something like Peter&#39;s <a href="" title="WP:AEE">WP:AEE</a> proposal provided it stuck to discussion and didn&#39;t get involved in bloc-voting (although as mentioned there, I think he sets the membership criteria way too high), but that&#39;s because it&#39;s open to everyone meeting an arbitrary set of criteria. An in-house version of the <a href="" title="Rand Corporation">Rand Corporation</a>, which is what an exclusive council would be perceived as, would be divisive (&#34;why aren&#39;t I considered good enough to post on this page?&#34;), stifle debate (&#34;I don&#39;t agree with this, but I&#39;d better not say so because all these Very Important Wikipedians disagree with me&#34;) and be too polarizing (as policy discussions would degenerate into shouting matches between those aligned with the Think Tank and <a href="" title="WP:VPP">VPP</a>, each convinced that they have the greater legitimacy). The benefits (streamlining discussion, filtering out the ranting posts from the &#34;my crank theory must be heard!&#34; tendency, tighter focus) don&#39;t IMO outweigh these negatives.&#38;nbsp;–&#38;nbsp;&#60;font color=&#34;#E45E05&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Iridescent">iride</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#C1118C&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Iridescent">scent</a>&#60;/font&#62; 16:11, 18 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>I think your idea for how a think tank should function are good, but your ideas for how to determine membership are bad. What does ArbCom have to do with this?

<li><b>Oppose</b>  Wikipedia as a whole is a think tank.  I realize we will never get ALL of Wikipedia to discuss every problem facing the community, but neither do I think we can have one sinle commitee to deal with all problems.  I suggest instead that any group of wikipedians are free to form their own ad-hoc group and write an essay on a specific problem and what they think is the source of the problem, and invite other Wikipedians to join in and edit the essay.  if enough people participate, they can then procede to discuss solutions to the problem.  While this is happening,other groups of Wikipedians would be free to start their own essays, on other problems, and again invite other members of the community to join in.  This is basically the way we go about writing policies which has been extraordinarily successful.  No one single group, just multiple, open, ad hoc groups, each dealing with that problem that most concerns them.

<li>No, sorry. The entire point of the consensus from the community has been that ArbCom has no business selecting such a group.

<p>Any body or group with a genuinely advisory role should have on it, on principle, people capable of advising. In industry, if people want to sort out issues or find out how they can improve or approach &#34;industry best practice&#34;, they do not appoint from amongst their own - they bring in experts from outside who know how the best practice works, who are appropriately qualified and experienced to offer quality recommendations, and they are fully detached and independent from any internal politics within the organisation in that they have no stake in the results (although they do have a stake in their own advice, in that if it works, they can point to it amongst other prospective clients as an example of their work).</p>
<p>Therefore I propose that we as the community (not ArbCom, whose role does not extend to these things) raise the funds through a transparent mechanism to employ outside experts to advise us on the things we need to do if we want to succeed, and for those steps and recommendations to be made available to anyone in good standing in the community who wishes to help Wikipedia get there. It may well be that those steps will not achieve consensus or agreement amongst us, and it may be that some are rapidly proceeded with, others bog down for years and others are vehemently opposed - that happens in real companies too. But at least we have the basis for moving forward in a collaborative and cooperative way, informed by industry best practice. It will assist us as well in arguing our case that we are acting professionally and responsibly in the wider world.</p>
<p>I realise this is a very radical departure from the way things are normally done here, but as someone once told me, &#34;if you never ask, you&#39;ll never know&#34; and I put the question on that basis. <a href="" title="User talk:Orderinchaos">Orderinchaos</a> 07:23, 19 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>I think this is a thoughtful idea.  Some people in academe have studied and presented or published on Wikipedia - they have methods and expertise that may well suit your proposal.  The problem I have with your proposal is that the community is it seems divided between those people who would wish more centralized and hierarchical authority, and those who want a more anarchic and participatory <a href="" title="open society">open society</a>.  What kind of instructions would we give such a group of consultants, when there is this kind of division?  I can too easily see us asking for research concerning antagonistic goals.  I think things change if we take governance off the table.  If we limit ourselves to smaller, more easily definable, yet still serious problems - retention of experts; BLP; on- and off-wiki harassment; making Wikipedia a more welcoming environment for a more diverse group of stakeholders ... then I think your idea has much merit.  It might be worth hiring consultants to help with a few of these very narrowly defined problems before buying the next server! <a href="" title="User:Slrubenstein">Slrubenstein</a>   |  <a href="" title="User talk:Slrubenstein">Talk</a> 18:26, 20 July 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>My experience with consultants is that while individually they&#39;re very bright, they often don&#39;t bring anything new to the table. The modus operandi that I&#39;ve seen is to interview key players within an organisation and refine ideas gleaned from those people. A key difference between here and RL is that in RL there is an executive which can drive through any recommendations made by consultants. Here we can&#39;t do that. I feel it unlikely that consultants would offer anything radically different to ideas we&#39;ve generated from within. We would find it difficult achieve the consensus necessary to implement their recommendations. --<a href="" title="User:MoreThings">MoreThings</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:MoreThings">talk</a>) 22:14, 20 July 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>I have some reservations about this, primarily because such consultants would tend to be most likely to contact ongoing regular editors for information, as opposed to individuals who have withdrawn out of frustration. Unfortunately, I personally think contacting the latter would probably be more helpful in the long run than contacting the former. This is not to say that it is a bad idea, simply that it there are a few difficulties with using it in this system. Having said that, I wonder if it might be possible for the Foundation to offer academics and other experts some sort of tax benefit (in lieu of direct pay) for offering expert input in particularly intractable matters relative to their field when they are specifically requested to offer such input. One of our biggest problems in editing is the fact that we tend to lose experts in most fields comparatively quickly, and this might be one way to help counterbalance that tendency. <a href="" title="User:John Carter">John Carter</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:John Carter">talk</a>) 13:54, 22 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>Thanks for the comments/feedback on this - all good points. I personally think it&#39;s one of those things that is great in principle but may come undone in the doing - another point would be how we would choose such (a consultant/consultants) (or where from!) and what specific expertise or background they might have, and that in itself may be a battleground. <a href="" title="User talk:Orderinchaos">Orderinchaos</a> 17:23, 23 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>More like a comment by me: <i>Councils</i> that Wikipedia needs are the ones that would include
editors who have proven a few qualities necessary for writing an encyclopeda, e.g. having demonstrated expertise in the fields they are mostly contributing to, and having more objective, non-ideological approach to writing there.</p>
<p>Such a <i>council</i> should have nothing to do with the present admindom and arbitration committee, which are by and large random sets of people who have been able  to grab enough votes - being most likely  lackluster bureaucrats and conformists, who can get anyone&#39;s votes if necessary. it&#39;s knowledge and  expertise that should matter  in an encyclopedia, be it online or paper version.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Proposal_by_Cenarium">Proposal by Cenarium</span></h2>
<p>I propose that instead of creating one permanent advisory council &#39;on project development&#39;, the community appoints an advisory committee for one specific purpose when it feels the need. Advisory councils provide advises on issues they are asked to investigate, but in this case &#39;project development&#39; is way too large a subject to be properly dealt with by an appointed body, and the wideness of it has plenty of negative consequences. First, it&#39;s difficult if not impossible for such a body to focus on one issue and not go in every direction, making it largely inefficient, unfocused, thus futile. It could try to organize its proceedings with an agenda (<a href="#Agenda" title="Wikipedia:Advisory_Council_on_Project_Development">as done here</a>); but, as <a href="#The_ACPD" title="Wikipedia:Advisory Council on Project Development/Drini">pointed out by Drini</a>, advisory councils don&#39;t create their agenda, their agenda is determined by those who appoint them, in our case the community or ArbCom; a self-determined agenda will also politicize the council, which is to avoid (see below). It also conflate the issues, with no assurance that a specific issue will be sufficiently looked into. Thus I think the subject to consider for an advisory council in our case should be more specific, for example, as those are frequently cited: flagged revisions, notability in fiction, speedy deletion, newcomers arrival, etc. Now, we could use a permanent advisory council, regularly refreshed somehow, to look into such issues when asked to by the community or ArbCom. I don&#39;t think it would be viable. First, as <a href="#The_ACPD" title="Wikipedia:Advisory Council on Project Development/Drini">pointed out by Drini</a> too, advisory councils are not, and should not be, elected, because it would introduce uniform and systemic bias, which would defeat the purpose of the advisory council, and politicize the deal and negatively affect the council&#39;s ability to provide findings or advises (what it is for) and its image (so the credit given to those). In this permanent council, with no election, it would be infeasible to establish a satisfactory (as elaborated below) rotation of members. Instead, I think the solution is to appoint a special committee for a specific issue. In our open, volunteering-based system, I am sure a non-specific council would not be efficient: members may not be interested in investigating a particular issue, so we would have shortage problems in involvement, POV problems could also arise since members would preferably look into issues they have a stronger POV in, and most of the other members won&#39;t get sufficiently involved in the issue. So it won&#39;t be neutral assessment in the end, which as far as possible, is a must. On the other hand, convening a special council for a special issue would assure a stronger and more varied participation and so a more neutral point of view, as interested persons of different POVs would join the council. We could call this process &#34;Requests for advices&#34;; the main problem would be how to appoint a special advisory council in a satisfactory way, but it should be possible, maybe using an endorsement system. <a href="" title="User:Cenarium">Cenarium</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cenarium">talk</a>) 02:51, 24 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>One issue that might arise is that groups take time to work up steam and get on the move, and typically go through a number of stages (even repeated cycles): forming; storming; norming; performing; reforming, and eventual dissolution. There&#39;s also the question of experience having to be acquired all over again to some extent when new groups form, though this would add to the experience of more folk in the longer term. &#60;b&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Esowteric">Esowteric</a>&#60;/font&#62;+&#60;font color=&#34;blue&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Esowteric">Talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/b&#62; 18:55, 24 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I agree we should try to preserve experience. I think this is possible in the dynamic approach I propose. To begin with, a user could serve on several advisory councils, simultaneously and successively, so they would acquire personal experience. For the first issue, while indeed groups take some time to get together to work, the existence of a clear objective for the council, predetermined by the community, should make it easier to focus and progress. I don&#39;t think there should be a unique standard for advisory councils, the mandate, objectives, scope and specifics if any of the council should be decided by the community prior to its constitution, it would of course heavily depend on the issue to consider. If it&#39;s a content dispute, a policy dispute, a process dispute, a long-term and divisive policy issue, etc. The question of how to make the appointments is central, and this may be through a system of volunteering with endorsement. That is, a user expresses interest in serving in a special advisory committee and says why their participation would be positive; and then, to be appointed, he/she should be endorsed. The question of who can endorse: I think they should be trusted and experienced members of the community, maybe arbitrators, bureaucrats, maybe additional users chosen by ArbCom. Of course, you can&#39;t endorse yourself.. It&#39;s still the &#39;brainstorming&#39; stage of course, but here is a possible way to appoint special advisory councils:
<ol>
<li>Proposal to create a special advisory council, description of the issue to be considered</li>
<li>Initial discussion on whether to create the council (skipped if convened by ArbCom ?)</li>
<li>If agreed to create one or convened by ArbCom, call to volunteers. One can nominate oneself. We should try to find users who could be useful in the council and invite them, those users who can endorse should pursue this goal too, invite users and offer them their endorsement.</li>
<li>Continued endorsement of volunteers</li>
<li>At the same time as 3 and 4, determination by the community of the scope, objectives, agenda and specifics of the council, all this is subject to evolution after the formation of the council. The community should also determine when the council is to be dissolved.</li>
<li>When the minimal number of endorsed volunteers is reached (10?) and the above discussion has concluded, creation of the council</li>
<li>The council investigates the issue; new members can continue to join the council as long as they are endorsed. They do what we asked them to do, which can include reaching out to knowledgeable persons in their investigation, find ways to resolve the dispute, facilitate the development of consensus, etc. All users are invited to comment.</li>
<li>Prior to the scheduled dissolution, publication of the conclusions of the council. Acceptance of new members may be frozen in the final stage of drafting of the conclusion. If the community wishes it, it can reappoint the council immediately.</li></ol></dd>
<dd>A general policy should govern the process, stating for example that advisory councils should act as facilitators. It is possible that a council will be appointed for an issue that had already been investigated by a previous council, or a similar one. In this case, the members of the previous council could be asked to or express their desire to be in the new council too, and they would very likely be endorsed again. <a href="" title="User:Cenarium">Cenarium</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cenarium">talk</a>) 00:40, 25 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
