<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Needed:_USB_turntable_in_UK.">Needed: USB turntable in UK.</span></h2>

<p>Long story short: I have two records, provably Public domain in both Britain and the US, that I&#39;d like to have transferred for use on Wikipedia. One is a selection of opera recordings, the other the 1936 D&#39;Oyly Carte Mikado. [Long story short: EU copyright law says that sound recordings enter the public domain 50 years after recording; These are from well before 1946, so they are out of copyright, even with the Uruguay Round Table Agreements  making things annoying for US copyright for things in copyright after 1996.]</p>
<p>If anyone has a USB turntable, and lives in the UK (I&#39;d rather not trust international mail), please contact me on my talk page. <a href="" title="User:Shoemaker&#39;s Holiday">Shoemaker&#39;s Holiday</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Shoemaker&#39;s Holiday">talk</a>) 03:19, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="User:Cognition_requesting_unblock"><a href="" title="User:Cognition">User:Cognition</a> requesting unblock</span></h2>

<p>  is requesting an unblock.  They had a pretty long rapsheet, but were indeffed back in May, 2006 based on multiple civility problems and repeated violations of <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Lyndon LaRouche 2">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Lyndon LaRouche 2</a>.  I have no background on the case, but am bringing it here for further discussion by anyone who may know whether or not this is a good idea.  I am inclined to support an unblock at this time, especially if there is no evidence of sockpuppetry or dodging his initial block; 3 years may be enough to have learned his lessons.  What does anyone else think?  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;contribs&#60;/small&#62;</a> 05:13, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>Looks like a reasonable unblock to me. You&#39;ll keep an eye out I&#39;m sure... <a href="" title="User:ChildofMidnight">ChildofMidnight</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ChildofMidnight">talk</a>) 07:44, 6 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Any unblock must be done with the topic ban in place.  It would be crucial the someone ensure that he stays away from people he&#39;s had bad interactions with in the past.  Note that one of the suspected socks (I&#39;d like more details on how that was determined) was in Jan 2008.  So it that&#39;s true, s/he hasn&#39;t simply been quiet for the last three years.&#60;p&#62;I remember Cognition as a troublesome and uncivil editor.

<li>Three years and no sockpuppets found?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Administrator_Advice">Administrator Advice</span></h2>

<p>I&#39;m seeking advice on an article. The video game <a href="" title="Dissidia Final Fantasy">Dissidia Final Fantasy</a> has seen frequent edit warring in the past due to the English voice actors. The Japanese voice actors are directly named in the game itself in the credits, but the English version of the game isn&#39;t going to be released until August. Until then, trailers and gameplay clips <i>are</i> being released, and that&#39;s where the problem has begun.</p>
<p>To date, only two English voice actors have been confirmed in print, and those are sourced. Various other characters can be heard in the trailers, and in the community and forums and such, their VA&#39;s have largely been identified by ear. But, they haven&#39;t been identified any other way - so far, none of the other VAs except the sourced ones have a reliable, written source identifying them, but the article has repeatedly suffered vandalism as registered and anon users alike add unsourced claims to the article regarding VAs. At times I was removing such unsubstantiated infor on a daily basis, but the page is currently protected.</p>
<p>Now, in a few days the protection will expire, and I will go on the record to promise the anon vandalism will begin right where it left off. In the meantime, as arguments on the article&#39;s talk page will show, everyone is intent to add the VA information back to the article with no source but for the users recognizing the voices by ear. Short of permanent protection from all editing until the game comes out I can&#39;t think of anything to stop these sorts of edits, but I really don&#39;t want it to come to that, especially since with the game nearing release we likely <i>will</i> get reliable sources for VAs soon. So....what can be done? <a href="" title="User:The Clawed One">The Clawed One</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:The Clawed One">talk</a>) 06:04, 2 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Keep protection going, warn everyone about <a href="" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> and start blocking if they keep it up?  Realistically, perhaps add an comment in the section saying &#34;do no add voice actors based on mere speculation, i.e. without a source.  It will be reverted and considered vandalism.

<p>I am reporting <a href="" title="user:Hobartimus">user:Hobartimus</a> for either some kind of nationalist bias or harassment of other users. I (initially as an IP, I have created an account now) have fixed an important legal mistake in two articles (see <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Austria%E2%80%93Hungary&#38;diff=300580727&#38;oldid=300338411" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Austria%E2%80%93Hungary&#38;diff=300580727&#38;oldid=300338411">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Austria%E2%80%93Hungary&#38;diff=300580727&#38;oldid=300338411</a> and <a href="" title="Kingdom of Hungary">Kingdom of Hungary</a>, <a href="" title="talk:Kingdom of Hungary">talk:Kingdom of Hungary</a>) and have even provided the text of the law in question, in which everybody can verify for himself that the law did not apply to Hungary. While user Hobbartimus seems to have recognized his mistake in the Kingdom of Hungary article (where the mistake was located in a footnote), he keeps reverting this in the Austria-Hungary article (where the mistake is the main text). In the Austria-Hungary article, I have also added &#34;fact&#34; tags, because the whole paragraph in question is IMHO nationalist POV - it should be deleted, but provision of sources would be acceptable as a last resort (so that anyone can see, who claims these things). I do not understand, why it is allowed to delete such tags, and why such tags exist then in the first place, when they can be deleted. In sum, the user exhibits a completely (or deliberately) irrational behaviour, I do not know how to deal with such people. I hope someone can help here.

<dd>Maybe I have not been clear enough: The law in question , right in its first sentence, lists the countries for which it is valid, the country called Hungary is not included there (this is a standard case for almost laws adopted in Vienna in Austria-Hungary). The user keeps reverting both this simple fact and the source - i.e. the text of the law - I have added. Where is the content dispute? What exactly am I supposed to discuss here? Whether he is able to identify the countries listed in the law text? This is vandalism. I have also addessed him on the Kingdom of Hungary talk page, where he did not react and corrected the SAME error as discussed here (because there - unlike here - it was just a footnote which nobody can see). In addition he has deleted the fact tags I have added. Is that allowed? I suppose no... A content dispute would be, if there was some issue of interpretation or ideology or competing sources, but there is definitely no such problem here. Am I supposed to cite the whole introductory sentence of the text of the law in the article or what (although that would be ridiculous)? <a href="" title="User:Pantotenate">Pantotenate</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Pantotenate">talk</a>) 13:26, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>  <a href="#Can_someone_review_this_decision_please.3F" title="Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive362">was permmbanned</a> in Feb 2008. Since then, he has created <a href="" title="Category:Wikipedia sockpuppets of HanzoHattori">several socks</a>, and seems to keep returning to Wikipedia; there is no indication that he will ever stop. His newest sock, <a href="" title="User:Ostateczny Krach Systemu Korporacji">User:Ostateczny Krach Systemu Korporacji</a>, was just discovered and banned today (although I cannot seem to find the CU request/evidence page...?). Yet I am not posting to complain about futile attempts to keep him away; instead I am posting here in order to request the review of the permban on him. Long story short, it appears to me upon a cursory review that his socks have been performing <i>constructive, not disruptive</i> edits; none of his socks has violated our polices, been blocked of even warned for anything as far as I can tell - they were editing constructively for weeks or even months, up to the point they were banned upon being confirmed as socks of HH (presumably due to editing the same articles/subjects). An unban of him was proposed by another admin already few months ago (<a href="#Productive_socks" title="Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive470">Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive470</a>) and since than we have accumulated more evidence (based on his continued pattern of editing via socks) that he wants to be a constructive member of our community. He is making constructive content edits (creating and expanding articles), he is not edit warring, and doesn&#39;t seem to be flaming or otherwise disruptive (which IIRC was a major complain against HH). As such, I believe we should review his behavior once again, since its shows signs of improvement, and consider unbanning him, perhaps under some restriction/mentorship. In the end, if Hanzo wants to help us build encyclopedia in a constructive manner, without repeating his past mistakes (as he has shown us he can), why should we not allow him to do so? Not to mention that blocking his successive constructive socks is making a mockery of our ideals that blocks/bans and such should be preventative, not punitive. PS. I&#39;d like to strongly encourage all who had bad experiences with HH to review his behavior in the past year and so instead of remembering old grievances. --&#60;sub&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a>|<a href="" title="User_talk:Piotrus">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&#34;&#62; talk &#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sub&#62; 04:23, 1 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No offense but are we looking at the same sock? OKSK has edit warred, been ridiculously uncivil (including after his block), and has not shown a single solitary sign that he has learned from his past mistakes, but instead continues acting exactly the same. He hasn&#39;t shown any desire to follow Wikipedia&#39;s guidelines and policies and his &#34;good contributions&#34; include tons of original research and copyvio&#39;s taken straight from IMDB! What constructive editing as he done? Making a glut of unsourced video game stubs?

<dd>Do you have the diffs for his edit warring and incivility? The only incivility I saw was after his block, which I consider understandable (which doesn&#39;t mean excusable, of course). I did review his video game articles, and they are fine - as noted in relevant discussion, there is no obvious copyvio. --&#60;sub&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a>|<a href="" title="User_talk:Piotrus">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&#34;&#62; talk &#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sub&#62; 23:53, 2 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Few reverts don&#39;t equal edit warring, but if you think his return should be conditional upon 1RR restriction, that may be a good idea. As for his talk posts, they are a bit childish sometimes, but I am not seeing any serious personal attacks? But again, a civility parole and a mentorship could be beneficial for him. The point is that a user who is mostly editing constructively can benefit from our attempts to reform him, and the project will benefit from that more then from banning and rebanning user who is, most of the time, peacefully working on good content articles (ex. <a href="" title="Lublin Ghetto">Lublin Ghetto</a>). --&#60;sub&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #228B22;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Piotrus">Piotr Konieczny aka Prokonsul Piotrus</a>|<a href="" title="User_talk:Piotrus">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#7CFC00;background:#006400;&#34;&#62; talk &#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sub&#62; 02:36, 3 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Unlike Collectonian and Russavia, I interacted with Hanzo for years, and <i>he was one of the most dedicated and productive content editors I have ever seen</i>. While editing under several accounts, he made around 70,000 edits and created hundreds new articles (some precise data can be provided if needed, <a class="externallink" href="http://toolserver.org/~soxred93/pages/index.php?name=HanzoHattori&#38;namespace=0" rel="nofollow" title="http://toolserver.org/~soxred93/pages/index.php?name=HanzoHattori&#38;namespace=0">this</a> is only a tip of the iceberg). I am mostly familiar with his contributions on Russia, Caucasus and Chechen wars related articles. I thought he lived in this area - so intimately he was familiar with the subject (I personally visited North Caucasus many times as a hiker/mountaineer). Hanzo was very cooperative, and we talked a lot about editing a number of articles. He did <i>high quality work</i>, as one can see, for example, from <a href="" title="Beslan school hostage crisis">Beslan school hostage crisis</a>, where he was one of chief contributors. He was <i>very cooperative with me</i>. If we decided to create an article, it was enough just to start it, as he was coming <i>to help</i> (see <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viktor_Popkov&#38;limit=500&#38;action=history" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Viktor_Popkov&#38;limit=500&#38;action=history">this article</a>, for example). He was a <i>very neutral editor</i> and corrected my POV many times. But there was another side of the coin. He worked with extreme dedication (sometimes 15 hours non-stop) and definitely overworked here. He also had a lot of trouble explaining what he is doing to others, especially if they were not familiar with the subject (I remember helping him to explain others the difference between <a href="" title="War crime">War crimes</a>, <a href="" title="Crime against peace">Crime against peace</a> and <a href="" title="crimes against humanity">crimes against humanity</a>). This led to tensions when he had a trouble controlling himself, which ultimately led to his ban. He also has an unfortunate habit of using foul words on talk. I would strongly support him coming back, but only under two conditions. First, he should make a promise and really to make an effort towards more polite and cooperative conversation with other users (I personally had no trouble communicating with him, but some others did). Second, he probably needs a mentorship and some form of civility parole.<a href="" title="User:Biophys">Biophys</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Biophys">talk</a>) 00:25, 3 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Sometimes the administrators face a tough dilemma: an editor who is obviously dedicated and able to contribute productively, yet who also--one way or another--has difficulty within a consensus environment.  Per <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Standard offer">Wikipedia:Standard offer</a> HanzoHattori seems like the kind of editor who would be a good candidate for a return, yet would go about it a different way than this.  Overall, we&#39;ve gotten better results in the past from bringing back banned editors who went several months without socking, than by unbanning in spite of recent socking.  So here&#39;s an offer: if HanzoHattori goes six months without socking at all, or makes at least 500 productive and unproblematic edits at another WMF site within the next three months, then at the end of the time frame I will initiate an unban discussion for him and support his return.  If he wishes, he is welcome to participate at any of the three sister projects where I am a sysop (Commons, Wikisource, or Wikinews), although any WMF site would be fine.  Best wishes, &#60;font face=&#34;Verdana&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Durova">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#009&#34;&#62;Durova&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Durova">273</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 18:51, 3 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Sounds reasonable. Could somebody inform Hanzo of this?

<p>I will try to be as concise as possible here. Firstly, what I am about to bring up is a systemic, on-going, pervasive issue about the POV and disruptive editing issues present within articles related to Falun Gong. It has become <i>very</i> serious over the past few years, and I don&#39;t know if this is the right place to go. The amount of POV-pushing on <a href="" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> and its related family of articles (<a href="" title="Li Hongzhi">Li Hongzhi</a>, <a href="" title="Persecution of Falun Gong">Persecution of Falun Gong</a> etc.) has grown to a point where it needs dire attention from not only an administrator, but much higher Wikipedia authorities. Questions you may ask at this point are:</p>
<p>1. What has been done about this issue in the past?</p>
- Numerous editors have reported instances of pervasive pro-FLG editing habits by several users to this noticeboard, to the Arbitration Committee, and various other Wiki-policy enforcing authorities. An arbitration on this issue has been conducted before, but its rules have not been enforced. In fact, if you search the administrator&#39;s archives, the issue of constant pro-Falun Gong editing has been mentioned no less than on ten separate occasions. None of the resolutions have yet become effective in keeping the contents of these articles NPOV.

<p>2. What exactly are the issues here?</p>

<ul>
<li>Disruptive editing, severe degrees of <a href="" title="Wikilawyering">Wikilawyering</a>, whereby sources critical of Falun Gong are constantly removed, regardless of where they are from. </li>
<li>POV-pushing. A read through the article and you will see that some of the POV-laden phrases are hidden quite subtly, are within the boundaries of the letter of applicable policies, but are outright against the spirit of these policies. </li>
<li>Article ownership. Critical responses to Falun Gong on the talk page have been constantly defended by four specific editors. </li>
<li>Abuse of other users. A look through the archives of the talk page (of which there are now 24), it is apparent that many editors have been branded as &#34;agents of the Communist Party of China&#34; and discredited as such. Much of the responses to any postings critical of Falun Gong involves very personal attacks, or personal swaps at credibility. </li>
<li>Various other abuses that are visible as soon as you take a look through the article&#39;s edit history and the history of its talk pages.</li></ul>

<p>3. How can we verify that this is true, and not just an attempt at reverse POV-pushing in itself?</p>

<ul>
<li>Go visit the article&#39;s edit history beginning around 2005, and especially since 2008. Visit the article&#39;s some 24 archives of disputes, unseen anywhere else on Wikipedia. </li>
<li>For one, the users that have taken ownership of the Falun Gong article have gotten very adept at bypassing Wikipedia policies. They will likely come to this very noticeboard after I post this notice and attempt to defend themselves vehemently. In the event this happens I urge you to listen to every word of their defence and assess their credibility yourselves. </li></ul>

<p>4. What is being proposed at fixing the issue?</p>

<ul>
<li>As other options have been attempted in the past and have been exhausted, an investigation led by <b>neutral, third-party administrators</b> or higher Wikipedia authorities, <i>must</i> be conducted thoroughly into the sheer abuse of Falun Gong and its related articles by Falun Gong and its related editors. </li>
<li>The issue is <i>extremely</i> serious. It would not be unfair to say that the continued existence of the articles in their current state severely compromises Wikipedia&#39;s credibility in these controversial topics. To my knowledge, nothing of this scale has ever occurred on Wikipedia. It has persisited for several years now and will continue if nothing is done. Something enforceable must be done. </li></ul>

<dl>
<dd>To be honest? I think that, without even <i>looking</i> at the dispute, I think there may be an issue here. Wikipedians tend to be, among other things, a little too pro-Amnesty International. An admirable real-life stance, but on Wikipedia taking AI&#39;s word as gospel can severely affect neutrality; they have a bias themselves. <b><a href="" title="User:Sceptre">Sceptre</a></b> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Sceptre">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 20:23, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>To be honest, in many cases the only thing approaching objective reporting on the cases AI reports is AI itself.

Where there is a more-or-less independent news media, Wikipedians can -- &#38; obviously should -- present other points of view on the case. -- <a href="" title="User:Llywrch">llywrch</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Llywrch">talk</a>) 18:17, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>

<p>Hi. I&#39;m one of the accused. It would probably do no good to give a point-by-point response. I welcome an investigation into both my conduct and editing behaviour, and into whether the <a href="" title="Falun Gong">Falun Gong</a> article adheres to wikipedia&#39;s content guidelines and is an accurate reflection of reliable sources on the topic. Let&#39;s hash it out. (note: the page in question has mostly been in its current form for about two years) What&#39;s next? --&#60;font style=&#34;bold&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Asdfg12345"><b>Asdfg</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34; style=&#34;bold&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Asdfg12345"><b>12345</b></a>&#60;/font&#62; 04:48, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I will comment briefly: the Falun Gong articles mostly contain references to high-quality academic sources, many of them peer-reviewed. As a rule of thumb, such sources do not resort to sensationalism, and seek to understand Falun Gong based on fieldwork, facts and solid arguments. This is apparently very disturbing to those who have different notions. In most cases, such editors have been unable to back up their views with credible and verifiable sources (for instance, we&#39;ve had endless discussions about the personal website of Rick Ross, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_34#Rick_Ross_on_Falun_Gong" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Reliable_sources/Noticeboard/Archive_34#Rick_Ross_on_Falun_Gong">who clearly fails WP:RS</a>). Referring to Wikipedia policies and guidelines frequently gets called &#34;wikilawyering&#34; and &#34;rule-page bashing&#34; (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikilawyering#Misuse_of_the_term" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikilawyering#Misuse_of_the_term">without concrete elaborations on the accusation</a>), because the proponents of fringe views a) are usually not familiar with the Wiki policies and what they entail, b) find it frustrating that the &#34;other party&#34; is able to back up their claims by references to existing policy, c) are on the losing side of almost any debate, because their sources do not qualify, and what prominent academics say is not consistent with their anti-Falun Gong ideology. Just like Asdfg12345, I welcome any outside investigators. Enjoy yourselves — this is an interesting show. &#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<b>&#38;#10004;&#60;/font&#62; <a href="" title="User:Olaf Stephanos">Olaf Stephanos</a></b> &#60;font color=&#34;darksalmon&#34; size=&#34;+1&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Olaf Stephanos">&#38;#9997;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 09:43, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>apart from the admin fireStar, who may have retired, basically all those who edit those articles are SPAs: either devotees of this organisation, or strongly pro-CCP/nationalist people. The articles are basically always going to be a joke, more or less. ArbCom can&#39;t change this, apart from deleting the article, unless they decide to read up on FLG (or anyone else) and fix it themselves. This actually would apply to a lot of new religious movements. <b><a href="" title="User:YellowMonkey">&#60;font color=&#34;GoldenRod&#34;&#62;YellowMonkey&#60;/font&#62;</a></b>  (<i><a href="" title="User_talk:YellowMonkey">&#60;font color=&#34;#FA8605&#34;&#62;cricket calendar poll!&#60;/font&#62;</a></i>) <a href="#Statement_by_YellowMonkey" title="Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Paid_editing">paid editing=POV</a> 13:01, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>There is nothing wrong with most of the sources currently used in the Falun Gong articles. As for myself, I am not a &#34;devotee&#34; of any &#34;organisation&#34;, and I find such labels insulting. I practice Falun Gong, just like some people practice tai chi or martial arts; I have never joined any organisation, as there is no organisation to join. I am also majoring in religious studies, and I am well-read in the scholarly works on the topic. I know the Wikipedia standards of conduct, and I know what it means that <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_tertiary_source" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Wikipedia_is_a_tertiary_source">Wikipedia is a tertiary source</a>. As long as all sides adhere to the rules and justify their stances through references to policies and guidelines, the articles will naturally be good and comprehensive.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>Objectivity and neutrality are methods in themselves: a fair and balanced article does not mean equating low-ranking sources with high-ranking sources. Wikipedia has explicit criteria by which to judge the quality of a source. Even in their present form — which undeniably leaves some room for improvement — the articles are far from being a &#34;joke&#34;. They contain references to most top researchers in the field and quite accurately describe their position. Abstract accusations and generalisations cannot help us get forward; we need people with a rigorous, methodical attitude, tangible suggestions, reliable sources, convincing arguments, knowledge of the policies and guidelines, and good faith. &#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<b>&#38;#10004;&#60;/font&#62; <a href="" title="User:Olaf Stephanos">Olaf Stephanos</a></b> &#60;font color=&#34;darksalmon&#34; size=&#34;+1&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Olaf Stephanos">&#38;#9997;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 13:38, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

I&#39;d like to pose this question to my fellow admins: If a user is blocked for an inappropriate username, then requests unblocking to change their name and the request is granted, is it ok for the editor to request their username change, then continue editing before the username change is put into effect?  <a href="" title="User:Toddst1">Toddst1</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk: Toddst1">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 03:55, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Probably a tough call.  If the user filed a properly formatted username change request in good faith, then they probably have no reason to avoid editing.

<dd>(ec) Are you suggesting that one of the forum posters is Simesa? Although off-site recruiting and POV pushing of fringe material is an old problem on the Lyme Disease article (exacerbated by the fact that the Lyme activists/conspiracy theorists seem to think we&#39;re all in the pay of the US political-military complex), as long as Simesa is editing within Wikipedia rules and isn&#39;t a sock of one of the many blocked editors that have haunted that page, I don&#39;t know that there&#39;s much we can do.

<dd>Yes, probably a case of Simesa making a well-intentioned attempt to deal with issues raised by people that they know from this forum.

In the light of your second diff above and the history of fringe-group activism on that article, I&#39;d also urge Simesa to be scrupulously careful about their edits on <a href="" title="Lyme disease">Lyme disease</a> and punctilious in selecting <a href="" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a> to support them.

<dd>There seems to be a misunderstanding - I meant a forum outside of Wikipedia.  I&#39;m on the Mensa forums, two Lyme-Aid groups (who did not ask me to edit here), Facebook, and several other &#34;forums&#34;.  No Wikipedia editor or reader asked me to edit Lyme disease.  I&#39;ve heard of sock-puppets but never known one personally.  I&#39;ve only known one Wikipedia editor who had to be temporarily suspended (let alone banned), and that was partly through my actions.</dd>
<dd>I asked for an RfC because, frankly, it seemed obvious that unbiased eyes were needed.  Since, as I recall, the article is semi-protected I thought we were guaranteed of getting experienced ones.</dd>
<dd>Although, based on both research and personal experience (my wife now has chronic Lyme disease despite many weeks of doxycycline), I am concerned that the Lyme disease article seems so heavily slanted in favor of laboratory studies as opposed to actual patient experiences I am still not unduly worried - the real action on this topic is now at the federal level.

<dd>I have to modify a statement above - My wife has done far more informal reading and research about Lyme disease than I have, and I had her double-check her notes and e-mails.  We found that a number of months ago she joined Healingwell.com, but has not posted to them nor received posts from them (after the initial &#34;hellos&#34;).  As for her reading the website she says she hasn&#39;t since joining, but I have no way to verify that. (This may seem like an odd post, but I have a policy of correcting all errors.) <a href="" title="User:Simesa">Simesa</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Simesa">talk</a>) 23:38, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I&#39;m running a check so as to accurately answer Tim&#39;s question with correct times. <a href="" title="User:Simesa">Simesa</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Simesa">talk</a>) 23:38, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The check has taken over a half hour so far and hasn&#39;t completed.  I&#39;m continuing it, but won&#39;t be able to monopolize our line endlessly. <a href="" title="User:Simesa">Simesa</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Simesa">talk</a>) 00:03, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The check is taking too long to wait for completion, I&#39;ll just report the times as shown.  Specifically, the forum I saw a note on was Yahoo&#39;s Lyme-Aid group.  My first edit on Lyme disease was at 07:05 on 27 June.  I made a change there at 14:19 on 5 July and then worked on a large number of changes that I posted cumulatively at 21:44 on 5 July (dial-up is a slow way to research and I have to share the line)(times are as reported in my Wikipedia histories, which are 1 hour earlier than current Eastern Time).  The (on the Yahoo group) post &#34;Wikipedia entry on Lyme&#34; was made at 19:15 on 5 July by a &#34;Sara R...&#34; (I can&#39;t tell what that time means, if it is when entered or when actually shown or Eastern or Pacific) - in any event, I didn&#39;t see it on 5 July as I was researching (my attention was called to it the next day). <a href="" title="User:Simesa">Simesa</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Simesa">talk</a>) 01:29, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>OK, that checks out fine. Unfortunate coincidence that two people on different forums were trying to recruit advocates simultaneously, one a banned user. You might tell Sara that it wasn&#39;t the case that &#34;Wormser&#34; wrote the article, it is just that we have to follow <a href="" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> and report what the reliable sources state on a topic. You might also point her in the direction of <a href="" title="WP:TRUTH">WP:TRUTH</a>, but she might not see the humour in that essay. <a href="" title="User:TimVickers">Tim Vickers</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TimVickers">talk</a>) 04:17, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you, Tim.  By the way, my check finally completed long after I&#39;d gone to bed (my wife stays up later, partly due to Lyme pain) - &#60;s&#62;the Yahoo group time is when shown on the board&#60;/s&#62; (current Eastern Time).  (I had to change this note after double-checking - my wife&#39;s note is wrong.) <a href="" title="User:Simesa">Simesa</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Simesa">talk</a>) 09:50, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>In the interests of completion (I&#39;m somewhat anal-retentive on getting details right), I need to modify the above statement.  Each Yahoo post apparently comes with TWO times.  Inside the post is the time when submitted (which for Sara R...&#39;s post was 19:15 on 5 July).  On the list of posts page is the time that the post is actually shown - which for Sara R...&#39;s post was 04:05 on 6 July (which is similar to the delay my own check experienced). I apologize for the confusion. <a href="" title="User:Simesa">Simesa</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Simesa">talk</a>) 10:11, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="User:Mr_Taz"><a href="" title="User:Mr Taz">User:Mr Taz</a></span></h2>

<p>I&#39;d like to bring to your attention the constant stream of misleading/nonsense redirects, edit warring and other unacceptable behaviour by <a href="" title="User:Mr Taz">Mr Taz</a>. The following examples are really just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Yesterday the redirect <a href="" title="England Government">England Government</a>, one of a number tagged by me which had been created by Mr Taz, was speedily deleted by <a href="" title="User:Tnxman307">Tnxman307</a>. Twenty four hours later, it reappeared, the work of the same editor. This is not the first time he has done this with his highly original and misleading redirects (see his Talk page), about 80 of which I had speedily deleted a couple of months back. He also engages in edit wars to reinstate the indefensible, such as &#34;national days&#34; invented by him (see <a href="" title="Talk:British Day">Talk:British Day</a> and also the edit history of <a href="" title="Foundation Day">Foundation Day</a>) etc etc. Despite having been banned for a week for his edits at the latter he was back again today trying to reinstate his imaginary &#34;Foundation Days&#34;, as <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foundation_Day&#38;diff=300979898&#38;oldid=300976945" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foundation_Day&#38;diff=300979898&#38;oldid=300976945">this edit</a> shows. His latest creations included <a href="" title="Flag of Great Britain and Ireland">Flag of Great Britain and Ireland</a> as a redirect to <a href="" title="Flag of the United Kingdom">Flag of the United Kingdom</a>. I&#39;ve got so tired of it that I now tend to let the purely nonsense or illiterate redirects such as <a href="" title="Regional Development Agency for the Yorkshire and the Humber">Regional Development Agency for the Yorkshire and the Humber</a> ‎ (redirected to <a href="" title="Yorkshire Forward">Yorkshire Forward</a>) pass by as I just don&#39;t have the time to keep up with it all. Other recent POV (not sure exactly what it is!) redirects include <a href="" title="Great British Central Bank">Great British Central Bank</a> ‎and <a href="" title="Great Britain Central Bank">Great Britain Central Bank</a> (redirected to <a href="" title="Bank of England">Bank of England</a>). I should add that these redirects, together with minor edits, are all that Mr Taz &#34;contributes&#34; here. He just will not listen to reason. Something needs to be done about this; all he is doing is creating work for others who have to deal with his edits. Could you please look into this, bearing in mind that much of the worst has been deleted so isn&#39;t on his contributions log? Administrators involved thus far include <a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a>, <a href="" title="User:Bencherlite">Bencherlite</a> and <a href="" title="User:Tnxman307">Tnxman307</a>. <a href="" title="User:Enaidmawr">Enaidmawr</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Enaidmawr">talk</a>) 17:19, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Regarding the imaginary &#34;Days&#34;, you might also consider <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequested_articles%2FOther_categorization_schemes&#38;diff=300979281&#38;oldid=300968140" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequested_articles%2FOther_categorization_schemes&#38;diff=300979281&#38;oldid=300968140">these requested articles</a>, just posted. <a href="" title="User:Enaidmawr">Enaidmawr</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Enaidmawr">talk</a>) 17:41, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>I have to agree with the pattern of edits pointed out by Enaidmawr. Many of these redirects are not helpful. See, for example, <a href="" title="Governor and Company of the Bank of England">Governor and Company of the Bank of England</a> (which redirects to Bank of England) or <a href="" title="James VI of Scotland and James I of England">James VI of Scotland and James I of England</a> (which redirects to James I of England) and are very unlikely search terms. &#60;font color=&#34;darkorange&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Tnxman307">TN</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;b&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;midnightblue&#34;&#62;&#60;big&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Tnxman307">X</a>&#60;/big&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/b&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Tnxman307">Man</a>&#60;/font&#62; 17:30, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;m off to check <a href="" title="WP:ANI">WP:ANI</a>&#39;s archives, but I think there was an issue with Mr Taz raised there (maybe even here) in the past month or so - a mission to <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foundation_Day&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=295825281" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Foundation_Day&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=295825281">invent</a> &#34;foundation days&#34; for the United Kingdom and also the Kingdom of Great Britain. The consensus at the time, if I recall correctly, was that it was bizarre behaviour.

<dd>I agree with Enaidmawr about this long standing disruption of Wikipedia by this editor. For further background into the Foundation Day edit war in particular, see <a href="#Persistent_disruption_by_Mr_Taz" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/IncidentArchive542">Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/IncidentArchive542</a>, <a href="#Continued_disruption_by_Mr_Taz" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/IncidentArchive544">Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/IncidentArchive544</a> and <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2009 May 8">Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2009 May 8</a> (top two entries). Since the beginning of March Mr Taz has embarked on his disruptive crusade to add a day or days he has made up to the Foundation Day disambiguation page, and despite two previous blocks for edits to that page or closely related to it, today he returned to his usual disruptive ways and added his nonsense again. I believe it is time he was told that any further attempts to add those days to that page will result in a block.

<li>First, have you asked Sarek about it?  If someone gets blocked for something, and continues doing it right afterwards, that&#39;s worth adding another block.  Blanking messages are not an issue (annoying) but by policy, we just assume they&#39;ve been read.  Comments like <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Postcard_Cathy&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=299838325" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Postcard_Cathy&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=299838325">this</a> aren&#39;t productive at all.  I&#39;d like to see others who have an issue over their edits as I don&#39;t see too many issues with the orphan tagging that&#39;s currently being done. The talk page is a little light on issues, is there something I&#39;m not seeing?  -- <a href="" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 08:32, 2 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>No, I havent said anything to Sarek, as its not exactly the same situation, its just similar (showing disregard for what is being said), I pointed out the blanking to show that the messages are at least getting read, just blatantly ignored. The recent taggings should now be OK if you are viewing the live article, as I have been through most of todays and done a cleanup. It would be nice if said editor would justify why they feel they are exempt from using edit summaries, and why they feel the need to place maintenance tags in random positions on articles! It does nothing for consistency. &#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blueviolet;font-size:70%;padding:2px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Jenuk1985">&#60;font color=&#34;blueviolet&#34;&#62;Jenuk1985&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;|&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Jenuk1985">&#60;font color=&#34;blueviolet&#34;&#62;Talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62; 08:42, 2 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>They do it because they don&#39;t care.  It&#39;s easy to just do whatever you want, and there&#39;s plenty you can do without interacting with anyone.  The difficulty here is the actual interacting with the other human beings part.  Hell, a bot could goes around and list orphan articles all day (and I thought one did).  That&#39;s not difficult.  It&#39;s the &#34;hi, let&#39;s talk&#34; part that drives some editors nuts.  There&#39;s plenty of editors for whom nothing sort of an indefinite block will make them respond or even acknowledge that other people here exist. -- <a href="" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 08:59, 2 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>As it stands, I don&#39;t think there is grounds for a block, unless the user continues on disregarding attempts to put him/her on the straight and narrow, then it becomes more of an issue. He/she went inactive shortly before I posted this, I presume they have gone to bed, so its only fair to wait and see if this brings any response from the editor. In the mean time, would it be considered canvassing if I alerted Sarek to this thread? As he has had past experience with this user, his input may be useful. &#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blueviolet;font-size:70%;padding:2px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Jenuk1985">&#60;font color=&#34;blueviolet&#34;&#62;Jenuk1985&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;|&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Jenuk1985">&#60;font color=&#34;blueviolet&#34;&#62;Talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62; 09:09, 2 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Oh, Jenuk, but the user continues to tag articles like a tagbot (actually, even worse than one. Less considerations, and no edit summaries!). Just look at her contribs! She isn&#39;t inactive, she just doesn&#39;t want to be disturbed with those complaints. So, Cathy isn&#39;t responsive at all, and continues this annoying behaviour, which leaves many newbies puzzled over what to do, and about if Cathy has any competence to harass them (I&#39;m still quite a newb myself, I know the feeling). And about 20000 articles plastered with tags is a lot of nuissance! The whole business of orphan tacking is questionable in the first place, because its not a required policy. It should be better left to a bot, and everybody would be better of of Cathy would concentrate on the more productive parts of her work, like correcting caps issues in Article titles, and mocing them. Imho it would be good if at least some warning would be applied! <a href="" title="User:Gray62">Gray62</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gray62">talk</a>) 10:55, 6 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>


<ul>
<li>PostCard Cathy seems to use edit summaries for edits that need an explanation, and no edit summaries for edits that are self-explanatory. Although I believe that people should use edit summaries for all edits, I think that&#39;s a pretty reasonable way to use edit summaries, and it doesn&#39;t seem to be necessary to badger her about it (disclaimer: I only checked a random sample of edits from the last couple of days). <a href="" title="User:Kusma">Kusma</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kusma">talk</a>) 09:29, 2 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>Uh, no giant edits? Everysingle one for himself, certainly not. But we&#39;re talking about up a user with 21200 edits, the majority of those are tags, judging from the contribs. Many o those tags were placed in violation of Wiki guidelines (surnames aren&#39;t tagged!), leaving other editors to do lenghty reverts.

<p>The problem here <i>actually</i> seems to be that other people aren&#39;t understanding what Postcard Cathy is saying.  I can sympathise to an extent if xe thought that xe was talking to a brick wall at <a href="#125.3B_pages" title="User talk:Postcard Cathy#Orphan tags on &amp;amp;#123;&amp;amp;#123;surname&amp;amp;#125;&amp;amp;">User talk:Postcard Cathy#Orphan tags on &#38;#123;&#38;#123;surname&#38;#125;&#38;</a>, because there was a problem with quite a number of other people not comprehending a point that xe did make twice.  Since <i>I</i> make <i>no</i> claims to being a member of Mensa on my user page, I&#39;ll try to explain what Postcard Cathy was saying to the editors who are making personal remarks about stupidity here:&#60;blockquote&#62;Postcard Cathy is using the toolserver-generated list of orphan pages.  In the list&#39;s description, there is a clear statement of the possibility that &#39;bots will go through this list and tag the pages.  Postcard Cathy is working on the basis that this happens, and is stating that <i>you</i> should work on the basis that this happens.  If you don&#39;t want to have certain pages not tagged by such automated processes, then you should <i>fix how that list is generated</i>.  Complaining about automated or semi-automated processing of the list is a mis-directed complaint.  Fix the way that the list of untagged orphan articles is actually generated in the first place.  Then any automated or semi-automated processing of it will fall into line with your desires without need for any further effort on anyone&#39;s part.&#60;p&#62;For what it&#39;s worth, I did once suspect Postcard Cathy&#39;s edits of being &#39;bot-produced, and in the same class as my long-time wikistalker, <a href="" title="User:SmackBot">SmackBot</a>.  <i>Treat xem like a &#39;bot in this case.</i>  Doing so will obtain the result that you desire.  Fix the input that is going in to the &#39;bot, the actual list of untagged orphan articles that is being worked from, and the output will as a consequence fix itself.&#60;/blockquote&#62;As such, a block for &#34;refusing to listen to what people say&#34; is not quite fair.  Because the problem here in part is <i>also</i> other people not paying attention to what Postcard Cathy <i>is saying</i>.&#60;p&#62;And Ricky81682 and Jenuk1985, please use some sense of perspective.  Placing a notice in a position that you personally don&#39;t like isn&#39;t &#34;disruptive&#34;.  People place article tags in all sorts of positions.  I&#39;ve seen   at the very bottom of a long article before now.  The encyclopaedia has yet to break from this kind of thing happening, in my experience.  The advice to <i>not sweat the small stuff</i> is actually good advice.  (Only sweat it when there are a lot of instances of the small stuff.)  If you start calling for blocks of <a href="" title="Wikipedia:WikiGnome">WikiGnomes</a> because they aren&#39;t on your <i>particular</i> vision of what the &#34;straight and narrow&#34; is, you will end up losing the benefit of the WikiGnomes&#39; activities.&#60;p&#62;Understand the fact that not everyone agrees on these things.  (There&#39;s plenty of evidence that people disagree about such things.  There are style issues that have gone to Arbitration, for goodness sake!)  There are, further, good reasons for placing tags in different places in different circumstances, and legitimate reasons that one size &#38;mdash; one vision of the &#34;straight and narrow&#34; &#38;mdash; does not fit all.  (<i>I</i> place certain tags in more appropriate places than all together the very tops or very bottoms of articles, and <a href="#Requesting_sources" title="User:Uncle G/Wikipedia triage">I&#39;ve been recommending</a> such placement to others, because experience has shown that it helps novice editors who are creating new articles, for about three years at this point.)&#60;p&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Postcard_Cathy&#38;oldid=299837877#Maintenance_Tags" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Postcard_Cathy&#38;oldid=299837877#Maintenance_Tags">This</a> is strongly recommended reading, too.  Further understand that style warriors <i>make life difficult for and annoy</i> the WikiGnomes who are trying to keep up with what this week&#39;s fashion might happen to be.  That isn&#39;t necessarily the WikiGnomes&#39; faults.  It doesn&#39;t improve such a situation to start calling for blocking the WikiGnomes.  It only serves to turn the people calling for blocks <i>themselves</i> into <i>additional</i> annoyances.&#60;p&#62;Also understand that the goal is to deal with the issues represented by the tags, rather than to waste a lot of time mucking about with disagreements over exactly where the tags go in the article.  Again, treat Postcard Cathy in this case like the &#39;bot that xe sometimes gives the appearance of being.  Make the articles not orphans, or not listed as orphans, and then you won&#39;t have to <i>care</i> where Postcard Cathy might place   in an article.  <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 15:15, 2 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>At least our bots use edit summaries.  If I had any of those articles on my watchlist, I would have no clue what&#39;s going on.  What is so difficult about &#34;tagging as orphan&#34;?  If there&#39;s a style policy and other people have to redo it, it&#39;s becoming disruptive.  Being a WikiGnome is fine, and being a very productive one is really fine, but not responding to questions doesn&#39;t help people.  I&#39;m not suggesting a block and I don&#39;t care where the messages are placed.  However, it is generally done at the top of the page and if putting the tags where most people put them and actually using edit summaries is too much for someone, then I really don&#39;t care for their edits here.  -- <a href="" title="User:Ricky81682">Ricky81682</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ricky81682">talk</a>) 19:06, 2 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

Look, Jenni &#38; Ricky, I&#39;m a big believer in edit summaries, and have been nearly 100% with them over the past three years, but it <i>is</i> a recommendation, after all.  There are real vandals out there who are devoting their energies to destroying good work here.  Cathy may appear to be a bit on the misanthropic side, but she is trying to do what she considers to be valuable work for the encyclopedia.  My advice is to spend your energy fighting the <i>good</i> fight, not the petty fight.  &#60;sub&#62;(And, by the way, I know what it&#39;s like to believe that everyone else is missing the point, to believe that you are the only one that realizes that this issue <b>is important</b>.  But withdraw from it today, and then look back at it in six months.  I have found that I felt rather silly about some of the issues that I thought were &#34;vital&#34; to properly wikipedializing.)&#60;/sub&#62;  Good luck to you. <a href="" title="User:Unschool">&#60;font color=&#34;52A249&#34;&#62;<b>Un</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Unschool">&#60;font color=&#34;23CE40&#34;&#62;<b>sch</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Unschool">&#60;font color=&#34;7ED324&#34;&#62;<b>ool</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> 14:58, 3 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>Gettind rid of orphans is &#34;preferrable&#34;, but not a requirement, too! So, with which right does Cathy editwar other editors when they simply remove the tag for a &#34;not required&#34; Wiki polciy? Imho she should better help people to get their articles linked, instead of doing a bots job, and even worse than bots. Orphanbots don&#39;t tag surnames, for instance! And they loeave edit summaries! And anyhow, what&#39;sa the point of bullying other people with tags thaqt are not required, making articles look horrible? What would you think about if Jenuk1985 would start tagging articles w2here tags are in the wrong place? It&#39;s not a required policy, but same rights for all! Don&#39;t you see that this uncontrolled tag business is about to go beyond being a mere nuissance, but becoming more and more of another turf of edt warring here, keeping good editors from doing more productive work? <a href="" title="User:Gray62">Gray62</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gray62">talk</a>) 10:26, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>That you keep talking about &#34;the wrong place&#34; shows that you have <i>still</i> failed to grasp a basic point, stated and re-stated above.  There is <i>not</i> a single right place.  As Postcard Cathy has pointed out, what there is is a succession of people with ill-considered views of the right place, each trying to enforce their narrow and mutually contradictory views of the right place.  As Unschool has pointed out, there are good reasons for putting tags in various places, according to circumstances.  <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 12:08, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>I obviusly raised the point of &#34;wrong&#34; placement of tags only as an example for Jenuk having equal right to tag articles that don&#39;t comply with that guideline. It&#39;s only a recomendation, just like Cathy&#39;s point that articles shouldn&#39;t be orphaned is only a recommendation, too. And My point is, where do we get if everybody tags articles that aren&#39;t completely in sync with rules and guidelines? Do you have any problems understanding my argument? You didn&#39;t really address it at all. <a href="" title="User:Gray62">Gray62</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gray62">talk</a>) 15:13, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Resolution.3F">Resolution?</span></h3>
<p>So, we still have an editor who adds orphan tags and doesn&#39;t use edit summaries.  Most people here seem to be of the view that it&#39;s not that big a deal (note that I as an admin don&#39;t actually need any sort of consensus to block someone, but I&#39;m going to hang back a bit) with a few noting that it&#39;s very difficult to work with.

<dd>Well, an editor continuing to be not helpful, unresponsive and often outright disruptive, especially creating totally unnecessary additional work for good editors, not participating in correcting her own mistakes, sure is good reason for a renewed review. The fact that nothing really changed since last time is grounds for concerns. And then there is the edit warring complaint against Giant 27 still pending, which raises questions if orphan tagggers have the right to insist on their tag not being removed, since its only a &#34;recommended&#34; policy, unlike the mandate to source facts. Imho it would be a good idea to wait for the findings in that case, before deciding this one. Personally, after having spend some time looking into Cathy&#39;s &#34;contributions&#34;, I think it may be helpful if a &#34;tagging ban&#34; could be imposed, for three days or so, giving the user a chance to break this somewhat fanatical habbit, and to concentrate on more useful work instead. But that&#39;s only my personal opinion as a normal editor, of course. Dunno if there are rules supporting such an administrative order in such a case, though. <a href="" title="User:Gray62">Gray62</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gray62">talk</a>) 11:02, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Too biased? Where is the evidence for that? Btw, Cathy seems to have been involved in tagging articles for deletion, too, so Rick may be actually be too biased for her! And WP:BITE? What does this have to do with this case? Cathy is around since 2006 or so. If anybody is &#34;guilty&#34; of driving newbs away, it&#39;s her, because she constantly intimidates newcomers, who just build their first stub, with her tags, but doesn&#39;t offer any help to them in coping with the alleged problem.<a href="" title="User:Gray62">Gray62</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gray62">talk</a>) 09:49, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Incorrect_Archiving_Resulting_in_Page_Deletions">Incorrect Archiving Resulting in Page Deletions</span></h2>

<p>Somebody (or somebodies, I haven&#39;t looked into who yet) has configured <a href="" title="User:ClueBot III">ClueBot III</a> incorrectly for talk page archiving across a lot of Talk: pages. This has caused ClueBot III to archive a whole bunch of talk pages at &#34;Talk:Page Name 1&#34; instead of &#34;Talk:Page Name/Archive 1&#34;. As they show up as orphan talk pages, <a href="" title="User:Orphaned talkpage deletion bot">Orphaned talkpage deletion bot</a> is deleting them. This is really content that should be kept. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve asked both bot&#39;s operators to update their bots to fix this problem. Archiving at a non-subpage (especially in the Talk: namespace) should be pretty rare. ClueBot can easily add a check (extra key, etc.) to avoid this configuration error. Orphaned talkpage deletion bot can easily check to see if the talk page was created by ClueBot and if there exists a page at &#34;Talk:Page Name&#34;. If so, it should flag the page for fixing vs. deleting it. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, there are a bunch of deleted talk pages that need to be restored, moved to the correct place, and the ClueBot archiving parameters fixed on the source Talk: page.

<dd>I traced back to this discussion because I was about to ask <a href="" title="User:Ibaranoff24">User:Ibaranoff24</a> why he placed these archive bots on dozens of Talk pages when, at a glance, none of them seem to be nearly active enough to require archival. I mean, I noticed it at <a href="" title="Talk: Michael J. Nelson">Talk: Michael J. Nelson</a>, which was 3.5k and got taken down to 1.5k by the bot. That&#39;s ridiculous. I changed the parameter on that page but I&#39;m not going to manually go through a hundred other Talk pages to see if they all need fixing, too. <a href="" title="User:Propaniac">Propaniac</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Propaniac">talk</a>) 15:46, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Because I thought it would be helpful for posts to be archived after being inactive for so long. I am sure that I posted the correct configuration. I seriously have no idea what happened here. Looks like these bots went haywire. The content is <b><i>not</i></b> lost - it still exists within the history. If any talk page has an archive problem, the missing posts can be added to the correct archival pages by editing the old revisions.

<dd>Your configuration was incorrect. You set the &#34;archiveprefix&#34; equal to the talk page name which caused the archive page to be created at &#34;Talk: Page Name 1&#34; instead of as a subpage. The archive bot did exactly what you told it to do. The archiveprefix needs to specify a subpage. It has already been fixed by Chris G. --<a href="" title="User:JLaTondre">JLaTondre</a> (<a href="#Top" title="User talk:JLaTondre">talk</a>) 00:01, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;ll see about fixing it later today or tomorrow.  I actually check that the page name is a substring of the archiveprefix -- I guess I just forgot to check for the &#39;/&#39; as well.  -- <a href="" title="User:Cobi">Cobi</a>&#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Cobi">t</a>|<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Cobi">c</a>|<a href="" title="User:ClueBot Commons/Bots">b</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 05:19, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Could you pls tell normal editors, unfamiliar with ClueBot, who came up with this idea of archiving talk pages, without the user&#39;s stated intent, at all? Was there a discussion about that, and consensus established? Imho user&#39;s talkpages shouldn&#39;t be subject to robot interference. And while sure some users like the help in getting their old stuff archived (me, too), I think it would be preferrable if tose users add their accountnames to a &#34;to Do&#34; list of the robot. Only my two cent, but, really, Cobi, where is the discussion about that bot? <a href="" title="User:Gray62">Gray62</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gray62">talk</a>) 10:16, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>You are mistaken. ClueBot only archives pages that it&#39;s been told to archive. If someone wants it to archive their talk page, they have to add it&#39;s archive configuration template to their page. --<a href="" title="User:JLaTondre">JLaTondre</a> (<a href="#Top" title="User talk:JLaTondre">talk</a>) 21:37, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Somebody should have notified me by e-mail, the accusations are serious and those who formulated them most certainly saw that I was absent for months. Fortunately, the guys under spotlight decided it&#39;s best to tell me. I saw that their accounts were perused carefully, but it was not taken into account how I made the <a href="#Welcome_message" title="User_talk:Vpopescu">welcoming message</a> on the talk page of one of them. If I would have had the intentions supposed above, I wouldn&#39;t have done that. They said they felt entitled to put the statistics of my account because they worked too under my username, but now they are very sorry for the trouble they caused me and they will stay away from it. Some years ago, other people I knew became interested in my work at Wikipedia and I gladly supported them. The initial idea was that each one should have a personal account, but in practice, since it was real life collaboration and we had available only one computer, most of their/our edits ended up under my username (this explaining also the stamina and the sudden polyglot abilities of my account across Wikipedia during some months). The situation changed during 2008 because of economic problems and I did not have the time to stay on-line and continue. I learned later that some of them managed to supplement their income by working at Wikipedia. I was familiar with the occasional bounties offered at Betawiki for the localization of MediaWiki and I thought it was great for them during these times. I didn&#39;t know about this &#34;paid editing&#34; issue, I read now about it (but it&#39;s a lot written, I don&#39;t know when I&#39;ll have available time). From what I could see, they did not have many choices in picking clients, but somehow it looks true what I was told, that bad and good stuff is brought together under the label of spam by users looking for quick fame inside Wikipedia. I was also told that only two accounts at elance.com are under spotlight (and this also looks true), thus simply favoring the other accounts on that website. Personally, I have a bad taste regarding the unprofessional manner I was treated, it&#39;s scary to see how the good work of years won&#39;t value nothing in a second, in the others&#39; eyes. I am dismayed by the way the comments of the &#34;enthusiast&#34; <a href="" title="User:Psychonaut">Psychonaut</a> were taken for granted. If I would have known <a href="" title="Margita Bangová">that article</a> could have been easily deleted because it breached BLP policies, I would have stayed away from all that drama. <a href="" title="User:Desiphral">Desiphral-देसीफ्राल</a> 11:19, 5 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I do not let &#39;arbitrary&#39; people use my account, even less spammers. In the previous years, these guys had good contributions, most of the time under my supervision, that was the context and the overall project benefited from my decision to contribute like this. The work under my account is a good work and does not deserve these attacks, the Romani Wikipedia is a first in history regarding the coverage of this unwritten language, now it&#39;s the place on Internet with most of the texts in Romani. Some of them chose to work and they walk now on their path. My account should be under spotlight only if itself creates problems. I don&#39;t know the rules of English Wikipedia and I&#39;d like to ask what happens if an user makes such blatant attacks like <a class="externallink" href="http://rmy.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vakyarimata:Sherutni_patrin_-_%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF_%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%A8&#38;curid=1398&#38;diff=20767&#38;oldid=19394" rel="nofollow" title="http://rmy.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Vakyarimata:Sherutni_patrin_-_%E0%A4%B6%E0%A5%87%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%81%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%BF_%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%A4%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%80%E0%A4%A8&#38;curid=1398&#38;diff=20767&#38;oldid=19394">this one</a>, using without any reason expressions like &#34;No legitimate administrators&#34;, &#34;the sole administrator is a paid spammer&#34;, &#34;Should the project remain open?&#34; In this way I&#39;d have the right to ask if the English Wikipedia should remain open, watching the unprofessional manner of conducting this investigation, the way this became the gathering place of the users who have a problem with me and the lack of respect for my work. <a href="" title="User:Desiphral">Desiphral-देसीफ्राल</a> 08:27, 6 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>You seem to be admitting that you&#39;ve let others use your account on the English Wikipedia (presumably they also have knowledge of your password), so it&#39;s difficult to take your accusation of unprofessionalism seriously. We can only judge by what we see - you must either take responsibility for the security of your account and any actions made from it, or acknowledge that you have no control over it (in which case it should be regarded as compromised and blocked accordingly. <a href="" title="User:EyeSerene">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:#4B0082&#34;&#62;EyeSerene&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:EyeSerene">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#6B8E23&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 21:08, 6 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>That went without saying, of course I changed my password. Anyway, personally, I did not create problems, on the contrary, I am proud a tiny part of Wikipedia is made by me and by people under my supervision, hence I keep my accusations of unprofessionalism. And the independent edits of the guys under spotlight are presented like the &#34;crime no.1&#34;, but somehow I am rather sympathetic to them. I can&#39;t see a serious commitment for solving this paid editing issue, but rather a kind of safari hunt of &#34;bad users&#34; and happy faces of hunters with trophies under their feet. As you probably have guessed, personally, I have no problem with paid editing and I am pretty sure that if the focus would be on the content, not on the user (yes, I just finished reading about Gregory Kohs) Wikipedia would be a better place. From what I discussed with them, the guys are determined to continue, but they will be more careful, this is their lifeline. You&#39;ll only end up as a <a href="" title="police state">police state</a> or as an African National Park with thrilled hunters, paid editing is inevitable and, your biggest problem, it is not immoral. I was not blessed to be a friend of the money, but I am sincere to say that I can&#39;t imagine a complex social life without them.

<dd>I&#39;m probably too involved at this point to block Desiphral for compromising his account and/or spamming, but I believe it should be done. It also still horrifies me that he has control over an <a class="externallink" href="http://rmy.wikipedia.org" rel="nofollow" title="http://rmy.wikipedia.org">entire Wikipedia</a>. I brought this up -- a bit harshly and, by necessity, in English, on <a href="" title="rmy:Vakyarimata:Sherutni_patrin">rmy:Vakyarimata:Sherutni_patrin</a> (&#34;Talk:Main Page&#34;), because it seemed a sufficiently high-profile page. Desiphral himself reverted me -- not a good sign. If it was because of using the wrong page, reverting wasn&#39;t the answer; if it was because of the wrong language, <i>most</i> discussions on that Wikipedia are in English; but if it is because Desiphral prefers to hold onto his unchecked power without anyone questioning it, it makes perfect sense.</dd>
<dd>The question remains, of course, what should be done about the Romani Wikipedia. I&#39;m looking for the correct forum on Meta to bring this up, but I think there should be a search for three or so good Romani users who are not Desiphral to be the next admins.</dd>

<dd>I concur - I&#39;ve indefblocked Desiphral because I find their assurances about regaining control of their <i>voluntarily</i> compromised account (if indeed it was compromised as Desiphral claims), and their attempts to justify and condone edits that are out of line with Wikipedia policy and best practice, unpersuasive. From the above discussion I believe they see no problem with their actions or would prevent them happening again. <b>Block review welcome, as always.</b> I can&#39;t help with Meta discussion (I&#39;ve never used Meta), but I agree that their adminship of the Romani Wikipedia - hosted as it presumably is on foundation servers - should be examined further in an appropriate venue. <a href="" title="User:EyeSerene">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:#4B0082&#34;&#62;EyeSerene&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:EyeSerene">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#6B8E23&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 07:43, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>It&#39;s not the commercial activities alone, but more the fact that the account was apparently being operated as a role account (with Desiphral&#39;s approval but without their supervision or editorial control, according to their posts above). The commercial part is related to the spamming from the account, which I regard it as an aggravating factor. Although the <i>account&#39;s</i> services - whether by Desiphral or not - were advertised on elance as noted above, at present there&#39;s no community consensus to block for commercial editing. <a href="" title="User:EyeSerene">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:#4B0082&#34;&#62;EyeSerene&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:EyeSerene">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#6B8E23&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 16:36, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<dd>I think there is a possible place for paid editing. But the   dubious articles contributed by the people we&#39;ve been seeing lead me to suspect that at least the elance service is not leading to useful contributions. There may be some people doing this right, in which case we will never notice them unless they advertise or respond to advertisements in a way we can trace. At that point we can decide what to do with paid editors who make good articles on actually notable subjects.. The current problem is the junk we&#39;ve been seeing, equally bad whether paid or unpaid.

<p> </p>
<p>I have a short proposal that we unban <a href="" title="User:Tobias Conradi">Tobias Conradi</a> (banned indefinitely). He has been banned for over two years now and I&#39;m sure he could be a useful contributor once again, after an email discussion I&#39;ve had with him. <a href="" title="User:Pzrmd">Pzrmd</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Pzrmd">talk</a>) 19:42, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>No particular opinion on a ban/unban of Tobias at this time, but I will point out that your account has been active for about a month, although you do mention on your userpage having been active previously; I&#39;m sure that your having email conversations with banned users would be put in better context if you were willing to identify your past account(s). Normally I wouldn&#39;t make a point of this, but if you&#39;re going to propose an unban without disclosing any specific rationale beyond &#34;I&#39;m sure&#34;, apparently relying on the force of your reputation and experience, I do find the question relevant and imagine others might as well. Not a demand, just a humble request. &#60;p&#62;Alternatively, explaining <i>why</i> you&#39;re so sure might go a long way in getting your proposal more effectively heard. &#38;ndash; &#60;span style=&#34;font-family: Garamond&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Luna Santin">&#60;font color=&#34;#1E90FF&#34;&#62;<b>Luna Santin</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)&#60;/span&#62; 20:31, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;m leaving this open for thoughts, that&#39;s all. I want to know what other people think. He was a very useful contributor since 2003. I know as much as you do. <a href="" title="User:Pzrmd">Pzrmd</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Pzrmd">talk</a>) 21:35, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>

<dd>Seeing the name Tobias Conradi pop up on my watchlist was certainly a blast from the past. He was a useful contributor, yes; then he ceased to be one, then he went insane.

<dd>You, and apparently Tobias Conradi, are not listening: this is not the place to discuss this issue at this time, and circumventing his ban by having another user edit on his behalf is also not going to help his case which, if he does want to return, will have to be argued, by Tobias Conradi and not another user, via email, to ArbCom.  <a href="" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Exploding Boy">talk</a>) 22:46, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>I&#39;m off to bed, but can someone keep an eye on <a href="" title="List of NFL champions">List of NFL champions</a> for me?  There&#39;s an IP editor which keeps changing the 1925 champion from the one officially designated so by the league to a different team.  There was some controversy over the 1925 season, but the page should represent the official NFL position as to who the champion was, regardless of that controversy.  I have tried explaining this to them, and I don&#39;t know if it will stick.  I need to head off to bed, and I am not going to edit war over this, but can someone else please review the situation and take the necessary moves to ensure that the properly referenced, neutral version is preserved?

<dd>Checkuser&#39;s just one tool -- a handy one, yes, but speaking <i>as</i> a checkuser I wouldn&#39;t even begin to claim every sock block has to go through me. <a href="#Identification_and_handling_of_suspected_sock_puppets" title="Wikipedia:Sock puppetry">Wikipedia:Sock puppetry</a> mentions a variety of methods; behavioral cues are often pretty reliable. At <a href="" title="WP:SPI">WP:SPI</a>, checkuser requests are often declined as &#34;unnecessary&#34; where enough evidence can be presented to determine a user is a sockpuppet without consulting private data. If a sock is obvious enough, as often happens with our more prolific sockmasters, investigation can be a waste of time. &#60;p&#62;None of this, of course, precludes reasonable objection from users who are rightfully concerned about the possibility of wrongful blocks. Since I agree that Dimitri Yankovich&#39;s behavior seemed sockish, I&#39;ve checked the account; it&#39;s a   match for  , who is also blocked as a sockpuppet. &#38;ndash; &#60;span style=&#34;font-family: Garamond&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Luna Santin">&#60;font color=&#34;#1E90FF&#34;&#62;<b>Luna Santin</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)&#60;/span&#62; 21:12, 9 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thx for providing the explanation! However, since the check didn&#39;t seem to be a big deal, wouldn&#39;t it be better to make it mandatory? If only one newb happens to edit the &#34;wrong&#34; article at the wrong time, and becomes blocked as a possible sockpuppet, this is one block to many. <a href="" title="User:Gray62">Gray62</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gray62">talk</a>) 21:29, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>However, there is no case &#34;Dimitri Yankovich&#34; at <a href="" title="WP:SPI">WP:SPI</a> either. And Wikipedia policy explicitly says &#34;If you think that someone is using sock puppets and wish to get other people&#39;s comments on the matter, you should create a report at Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations and follow the instructions there.&#34;. It doesn&#39;t say Admins can simply block accounts because of a suspicion. The contribs of that Yankovich guy sure look suspicious, but shouldn&#39;t Connolley have followed proper procedures, which would have included proper discussion about this? <a href="" title="User:Gray62">Gray62</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gray62">talk</a>) 21:46, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Muntuwandi has created a huge number of socks already. For those with a knowledge of his editing interests, detecting these socks is not that hard. In this case I pointed out the possibility to WMC on his talk page and here on ANI prior to the block. It is only editors and administrators apparently unfamiliar with his editing patterns and abusive socking who have raised any objection.

<p>At <a href="" title="Ancient history">Ancient history</a> I noted that   had removed a &#39;too long&#39; template although the article was 110 kb. I drew editors&#39; attention to the length of the article and our guidelines at <a href="" title="WP:TOOLONG">WP:TOOLONG</a>, noting that there was no rush. Shortly thereafter Reddi cut out over 60kb and changed the dab page <a href="" title="Ancient civilization">Ancient civilization</a> to an article. Not only no discussion, but just copy and paste with no attribtuion, thus breaching our licences. I&#39;m not sure how to rectify the license situation, just revert it all? Is there any guidance about suddenly changing a dab page to an article which doesn&#39;t even have all the links the dab page had?

<dd>I believe that attribution requires acknowledgment of the purpose of the link. A wikilink within the article itself doesn&#39;t meet the conditions of <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Splitting">Wikipedia:Splitting</a>, that&#39;s for sure. :) Our readers would have no more reason to look at <a href="" title="ancient history">ancient history</a> for attribution than they would, say, <a href="" title="history">history</a>, which is also wikilinked. A hyperlink in edit summary is sufficient. Recommend language is &#34;split content from <a href="" title="article name">article name</a>&#34;. There are also several templates to place at talk pages to note splits. There&#39;s a conversation about the subject in general at <a href="#Edit_summaries.2C_best_practice" title="Help talk:Merging">Help talk:Merging</a> (and it could use more contributors). There I&#39;ve proposed jettisoning the whole lot of &#34;merge from&#34; and &#34;merge to&#34; and &#34;split from&#34; templates in favor of one, currently housed at <a href="" title="User:Moonriddengirl/License credit">User:Moonriddengirl/License credit</a>, which would render on an article&#39;s talk page like so:</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>As that template highlights, we also recommend a note in edit summary and/or at the article talk of the source article, just to prevent future deletion. This seems more imperative to me with articles that are more in danger of deletion, but I suppose it can also help to prevent a move that would break attribution chain.

<dd>As to the attribution chain, how far back must it go? <a href="" title="User:Reddi">J. D. Redding</a> 19:28, 10 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As far back as there are substantial creative content contributors whose works are copied. <a href="" title="wmf:Terms of Use">wmf:Terms of Use</a> sets out the condition of license: &#34;As an author, you agree to be attributed in any of the following fashions: a) through a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to the article or articles you contributed to, b) through a hyperlink (where possible) or URL to an alternative, stable online copy which is freely accessible, which conforms with the license, and which provides credit to the authors in a manner equivalent to the credit given on this website, or c) through a list of all authors. (Any list of authors may be filtered to exclude very small or irrelevant contributions.)&#34; Essentially, if there is enough creativity to warrant copyright protection, attribution is required. But say you split material to <a href="" title="Ancient civilization">Ancient civilization</a> from <a href="" title="Ancient history">Ancient history</a> and duly note it. If <a href="" title="Ancient civilization">Ancient civilization</a> is later split again into <a href="" title="Semi-recent civilization">Semi-recent civilization</a>, you wouldn&#39;t need to note that the attribution history of <a href="" title="Ancient history">Ancient history</a> should also be checked. Those tracking the attribution history should be able to follow the chain themselves. --<a href="" title="User:Moonriddengirl">Moonriddengirl</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Moonriddengirl">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 19:45, 10 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I find the last sentence of this post a bit of sick joke considering the recent largescale removal of 20-30 editors contributions to that page, based on one person&#39;s idea of what civility is.

<dd>I have to say that 93 people is a fair chunk of the community, considering that many aspects are decided by much small groups.

<dd>I refer to it as disappeared because that&#39;s what it is. It certainly has not been courtesy blanked or archived (not that we archive Rfc sections). Just make your mind up, and decide whether you considered it a valid discussion (as you did when posted, and seem to want to do know), or you want to claim after the event that you agree with its summary yanking on principle, irrespective of how many people had taken it as meant, when Risker turned up days later and tarred all participants as de-facto violators (that ironically includes you Jack). <a href="" title="User:MickMacNee">MickMacNee</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:MickMacNee">talk</a>) 12:36, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>Well I don&#39;t think it will matter, because policies on Wikipedia basically never matter. It matters how many people you have on your faction. The only policies that are close to being applied reasonably are FA/GA/FL criteria, vandalism and spam, the latter two because established editors have no reason to partake in them. As for civility, people use two different standards for their mates and their enemies.

<dd>eg, I have seen in the past, some rv wars on major WP policies, those that affect every article, NPOV related stuff. But only 4-5 people bothered to discuss or rv war, even though it affects 100% of articles. OTOH, teh FA criteria affects maybe 1% of articles (0.1% are FAs and others are aspriing to FA) but maybe 50-100 people joined the discussion. Why? because the FA criteria is used at FAC/FAR and articles are scrutinised. As for OR policy, it doesn&#39;t matter what the policy says, heaps of people flagrantly ignore it anyway, and the only point of changing the policy is to move the boundary line and &#34;convict&#34; an opponent of breaking rules. <b><a href="" title="User:YellowMonkey">&#60;font color=&#34;GoldenRod&#34;&#62;YellowMonkey&#60;/font&#62;</a></b>  (<i><a href="" title="User_talk:YellowMonkey">&#60;font color=&#34;#FA8605&#34;&#62;cricket calendar poll!&#60;/font&#62;</a></i>) <a href="#Statement_by_YellowMonkey" title="Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Paid_editing">paid editing=POV</a> 02:15, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;m dead serious. NPOV policies are mostly irrelveant. I know of an entire ethnic group on Wikipedia (admins among them) who insist on using &#34;freedom fighter&#34; all over the place. Look everywhere and you will see a person using one interpretation of some policy for one thing and another when their opponent wants to cite a blog or whatever. If you want arbcom attention, you turn something into a big circus. Else, you won&#39;t get attention, most likely the arbitrators find the topic of dispute to be deadly boring. From when I was on arbcom there were about 5-6 arbcom cases related to a certain geographical area. The first five were about POV allegations and there were a handful of posts on the mailing list, in some cases one or none. In one case that was actually about embarrassing rioting and juicy conspiracies, there were about 50-100 .... <b><a href="" title="User:YellowMonkey">&#60;font color=&#34;GoldenRod&#34;&#62;YellowMonkey&#60;/font&#62;</a></b>  (<i><a href="" title="User_talk:YellowMonkey">&#60;font color=&#34;#FA8605&#34;&#62;cricket calendar poll!&#60;/font&#62;</a></i>) <a href="#Statement_by_YellowMonkey" title="Wikipedia:Requests_for_comment/Paid_editing">paid editing=POV</a> 02:26, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Agree with NeutralHomer. You should&#39;ve walked away form the initial situation and the related baiting when he didn&#39;t stop, and asked for another admin to step in. If you can&#39;t be a non-drama admin, consider relinquishing your buttons. I say that seriously - Admins should have the backbone and commitment to make decisions they are willing to back and stand up for, instead of having a penchant for timidly acting halfway, then running not for backup in a messy situation, but for personal reassurances and ego stroking.

<p>While looking apparently good results in the mouth is generally a BAD idea ... e.g.
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Some folks did something wrong (premature manual archive) <i>apparently</i> in good faith</li>
<li>Slap on the wrist, don&#39;t do it again (perpetrators noted on article probation page)</li>
<li>Move on</li></ul></dd></dl>
<p>But the unmentioned part of this list is:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li><b>Work around the damage of the (bad) act</b> (whether good intentioned, or not) ... which puts a burden on people who had no burden until the &#34;bad act&#34; and the &#34;apparently good solution.&#34; </li></ul></dd></dl>

<p><b>Reverting the bad act</b> would have saved the many hours of labor required in the aftermath ... while not leaving in place any &#60;u&#62;rhetorical benefit&#60;/u&#62; accrued from the <i>apparently</i> good faith act which has unfortunate timing with respect to a &#34;Neutrality&#34; tag ... and discussions with posts as recent as the day of archiving and few older than a few days, which is the basis of a <b>policy dispute</b> which must be clarified, and which was swept off the table by the BAD ACT of premature manual archiving.</p>

<dl>
<dd>NOTE (<b>Why didn&#39;t I revert it?)</b> I saw the first half of the archiving as an edit summary happening, and reacted to it with a message on the talk page (rather than reverting myself, with implications of an edit war) ... which was quickly followed by Mr. Dodd&#39;s archiving the rest (without an edit summary) ... and if I then reverted the two editors myself etc etc ... and so I stayed on the talk page to object to the bad act. </dd></dl>

<p>Saying that, oh, <i>just put a new heading, and link down to the archive, and all is well</i> ... WELL NO, since I do not think it normal practice (is it) to continue discussions down in an archive. Yada yada yada <i>(surely some can argue otherwise, but not persuasively). </i></p>
<p><b>IN ANY CASE...</b> &#60;u&#62;I assume the &#34;apparently good solution&#34; will stand&#60;/u&#62;, HOWEVER <b>the policy dispute</b> ... <i>and Mr. Dodd&#39;s <b>behavior</b> in the context of it</i> (&#60;u&#62;discussions of which were swept off the table&#60;/u&#62;) will apparently need a forum other than that talk page. </p>

<dd>If you would like to handle this, first explain to the editor the reason why this is forbidden (because it loses the article history), then undo the edits to the two articles or ask him to do it himself.

<dd>Actually, looking at the move, it looks like he clearly noted in both edit logs what he was doing; which is usually enough for a cut-and-paste move.  Some situations mandate a C&#38;P move, such as article mergers, and this is the standard way it is done.  Since both edit logs indicate the time and content moved, I think that is enough to qualify for GFDL/CC compliance.  See <a href="" title="Help:Merging">Help:Merging</a> for more info.  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;contribs&#60;/small&#62;</a> 04:46, 10 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>While the edit summaries have helpful information, I think it is best to keep the page history in one article. Since the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sims_Reeves&#38;diff=298745124&#38;oldid=298743493" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sims_Reeves&#38;diff=298745124&#38;oldid=298743493">cross-page diff</a> shows no substantial changes, I suggest that the old redirect/current article be tagged with   or speedied <a href="#G6" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> and the old article/new redirect moved as usual.

<dd>I&#39;ve history merged the <a href="" title="Sims Reeves">Sims Reeves</a> article, and I&#39;ve notified Jack about this discussion. Cut and paste moves should only be performed when merging or splitting articles. Using an edit summary to note a regular cut-and-paste move is not adequate because edit summaries aren&#39;t machine-readable. Also, when an article&#39;s history is split into two or more parts, some of the history can disappear due to page moves and other problems. For example, part of the page history for the <a href="" title="light-year">light-year</a> article was at <a href="" title="Template:Convert/kly">Template:Convert/kly</a> for over a year. <b><a href="" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a></b>&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Graham87">87</a>&#60;/font&#62; 09:16, 10 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Many humble apologies from this sheepish perpetrator.  Not sure what the heck I thought I was doing there.   I&#39;ve done uncountable page moves, and have often flagged for admin attention moves I couldn&#39;t do myself.  For some reason, I just got it into my head that this solution was both available and acceptable.  One out of two ain&#39;t bad, I guess.  One of the risks of the Be Bold exhortation is that this sort of thing will occasionally happen, even to the cream of editors (*cough*).

<dd>I understand NLT. It&#39;s a flawed policy. It&#39;s great for stopping the idiots who say &#39;I want the article to match my POV or i&#39;ll sue you&#39;. It&#39;s NOT good at all when a foreign government body pursues actual legal action. This is a real legal situation going on here. A en.wiki editor stole 3300 images, breaking the laws in the UK. That&#39;s as simple as it gets. He was notified via his en.wiki available email, and apparently the foundation already knows, but blocking the account doesn&#39;t look like Wikipedia respects the seriousness of the matter; it looks like we&#39;re a bunch of idiotic kids effecting an &#39;if we block you, you don&#39;t count&#39; attitude. and frankly we look a bit parochial, saying &#39;your laws don&#39;t count as far as we think we&#39;re concerned. Situations like this are not, or at least, should not be, what NLT is about. NLT is about &#39;do what I say or I&#39;ll sue cause I&#39;m an immature kid or adult who can&#39;t handle hard truths,&#39; not &#39;you broke the laws of our nation, and we&#39;re coming after you with weight.&#39; <a href="" title="User:ThuranX">ThuranX</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ThuranX">talk</a>) 04:11, 11 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>(To Algebrist and Calton) It&#39;s a crime, in the UK, to take the UK&#39;s copyrighted materials. He admitted to doing so. Your debate is &#34;is it a crime if my country doesn&#39;t recognize it but the country the materials were taken from does?&#34; that&#39;s a thorny one, but that&#39;s a personal moral issue. I could go on about how the entire internet contributes to the idea that everything that&#39;s ever been on the internet is public domain because the audience size has increased exponentially over what it would&#39;ve, could&#39;ve been 25 or 75 years ago, but that&#39;s another debate entirely.

</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Flameviper_ban_review">Flameviper ban review</span></h2>

<p> </p>
<p>Recently   contacted the unblock-en-l mailing list requesting a review of his community ban. Flameviper was community banned on 13 February 2007 and the block implemented by <a href="" title="User:Yanksox">User:Yanksox</a> who noted: &#34;unrepentant sockmaster, wasted community patience and good faith efforts. We don&#39;t have time to wait for you to grow up.&#34; Following Flameviper&#39;s ban, he returned with various socks including   and it is this account that he is requesting the community grant him permission to use if his unbanned. As Flameviper, his most noteworthy contribution to this project was the creation of the <a href="" title="WP:ADOPT">Adopt-a-user</a> program, a program used to help many new users become familiar with Wikipedia, however, he also struggled with issues mostly related to maturity, including the socking and also difficulties dealing with disagreements with other users.</p>
<p>In June 2007, he successfully appealed but the ban was reinstated 11 hours later when the results of a checkuser indicated he had used a sock (<a href="" title="User:Two-Sixteen">User:Two-Sixteen</a>) in the very unban discussion. For more details see <a href="#Unblock_of_Flameviper_with_editing_restrictions" title="Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Community_sanction/Archive9">Unblock of Flameviper with editing restrictions</a>. 
And a further rather unorthodox appeal in June 2008 was not successful because he had created the account Ziggy Sawdust in February 2008 and used that to edit in violation of the ban for four months and then announced this fact at ANI asking to be unbanned. For further details see <a href="#I_am_the_banned_user_Flameviper." title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39;_noticeboard/IncidentArchive430">I am the banned user Flameviper</a></p>
<p>Also of relevance, on 21 April 2009 Flameviper (at <a href="" title="User talk:Ziggy Sawdust">User talk:Ziggy Sawdust</a>) posted an unblock request which was declined by Sandstein, you can see his request and subsequent comment <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZiggy_Sawdust&#38;diff=285240826&#38;oldid=225451648" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AZiggy_Sawdust&#38;diff=285240826&#38;oldid=225451648">here</a>. </p>
<p>Flameviper was very young at the time of the ban and he tells me that he has matured a lot over the last year and is now ready and willing to abide by Wikipedia&#39;s policies and guidelines. He also assures me there has been no recent socking. If the community decides to unban him, I would recommend some sort or mentorship, a restriction to one account (User:Ziggy Sawdust) with the ban reapplied if further socking or disruptive behaviour resumes. For the record, I would be willing to help and advise him and generally provide backup mentorship for him but unfortunately I lack the time to be his &#34;full time&#34; mentor, but hopefully another admin or experienced editor would be willing to do that in the event he is unbanned. </p>
<p>For folks not around back then and not familiar with Flameviper&#39;s history, you may find further discussions here: <a href="#User:Flameviper_needs_a_coach" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39;_noticeboard/Archive74">Flameviper needs a coach</a> <a href="#Flameviper" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39;_noticeboard/Archive91">Flameviper</a> and the relevant sock categories are <a href="" title="Category:Wikipedia sockpuppets of Flameviper">Category:Wikipedia sockpuppets of Flameviper</a> and <a href="" title="Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Flameviper">Category:Suspected Wikipedia sockpuppets of Flameviper</a>. </p>

Also note that in the section below we&#39;re transcluding from the <a href="" title="User:Ziggy Sawdust">User:Ziggy Sawdust</a> talk page so that Flameviper can respond to comments and answer any questions so please keep an eye on that section for his responses (hopefully I&#39;ve set the transcluding up correctly, I&#39;m rather a noob with this sort of thing so apologies if I&#39;ve made a mess!).

<dd>Hi. I&#39;m the user known alternately as Flameviper, Lumberjake, Two-Sixteen, Ziggy_Sawdust etc. I&#39;ve been banned from en.wp since February 2007.</dd></dl>
 

<dl>
<dd>There&#39;s a very long story behind this, and a lot of things have happened. In short, the original ban was because of &#34;personal attacks&#34; on the user Elaragirl; I have talked to her since then and we&#39;re cool [for lack of a better term].This, of course, followed a lot of short blocks/immaturity/etc on my part, and a lot of arguments between me and the admins.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>Now, being thirteen, and enthusiastic about editing the encyclopedia, I decided to do what I&#39;d been recommended to do before and simply create a new account with no ties to the old one. Which worked fine, until my old account&#39;s name was revealed. This led to a block on the new account, despite my having done nothing ban-worthy on it. This continued with a few accounts until June 2008, when the crap really hit the fan and Ziggy_Sawdust was permanently banned. Apparently, no amount of positive contribution to en..wp was good enough to let me stay.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>Anyway, I&#39;d like to request an unblock under Ziggy_Sawdust and a clean slate on en:wp. This whole thing is ridiculous, to say the least - pretty much every administrative decision regarding me has been made based on stuff I did when I was twelve.. Although I&#39;m probably the only one who&#39;s ever done something immature at that age, hopefully we can put this behind us and I can resume editing.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>At the time of the block, I was working on a few articles and getting them to GA with rewriting and research. I was doing some AV/newpage work with Twinkle too, and cleaning out the categorization/cleanup backlogs. I don&#39;t want to be pretentious, but I started WP:ADOPT too. As for anything else, you can look at any of my contributions from any of my accounts.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>And yes, I know a lot of stuff happened. I did a lot of stuff I regret doing, and I&#39;m not going to make excuses for it. However, I&#39;d like to think I&#39;ve grown up a bit in the last two and a half years (!), and that I can put the drama in the past - editing WP was a hobby of mine for a while and I&#39;d like to help build an encyclopedia again.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>PS. If you disagree with something I&#39;ve said here, please don&#39;t just pooh-pooh the post, I&#39;d be more than glad to have correspondence with you about any questions/concerns you may have.</dd></dl>

<li><b>Oppose Unblock</b>. I don&#39;t think that with the age flameviper now is, maturity will have increased <i>that much</i>. People who&#39;ve seen me around will know that I normally stand on the other side of the line from people like Friday when it comes to ageism, but in this case I&#39;m willing to make an exception. He&#39;s saying he did stupid, immature things when he was twelve, and he&#39;s all adult and mature now that he&#39;s... fourteen? I doubt it. He&#39;s moved from being a child to being a <i>hormonal</i> child - that doesn&#39;t traditionally bring instant maturity. My normal argument is &#34;if someone is immature, we should be able to see it in their contributions&#34; - in this case we have. Essentially he&#39;s had a one year gap between his socking and now, not two, and I didn&#39;t see a big jump between twelve and thirteen, so why should the gap between thirteen and fourteen be any different? <a href="" title="User:Ironholds">Ironholds</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ironholds">talk</a>) 13:42, 5 July 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Support Unblock</b> While I understand where Ironholds is coming from, I think there is a very big difference between 12 and 14 - in very much why there is this thing called &#34;teenager&#34; that is a transitional stage between child and adult - in that behaviours do change drastically in this period.

<li>I don&#39;t know Durova, he says he hasn&#39;t socked for over a year and so far no one has produced any evidence showing otherwise and even the CU who exposed the 2007 socking-while-appealing has supported. Do you have any evidence to suggest it has actually been only less than 6 months? If so, I&#39;d be very interested to see it. Otherwise I&#39;d suggest you might reconsider? He has tried to do the right thing this time by contacting the unblock mailing list to appeal and I think you might be being a bit of a hard task master by requiring he do more time and edit another WMF project, if he has already sat out over a year, as he says.

<dd>Thank you for your review, Ed. Flameviper has left a response for you in the section below and I would just add that I&#39;m unsure why Durova believes that he hasn&#39;t sat out six months. I&#39;m personally not aware of any evidence that suggests he isn&#39;t telling the truth when he says he hasn&#39;t edited for over a year and I spent a few hours reviewing his case and compiling information for the above statement. I would very much welcome seeing any such evidence, though, if Durova or anyone else has any. Also note that Jpgordon, the checkuser who identified and revealed that Flameviper was using a sock during the June 2007 unban discussion has endorsed unblocking. Thank you for reviewing the appeal; I do appreciate you taking the time. <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 08:37, 6 July 2009 (UTC)  </dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Support unban</b> WP works on the spirit that everyone makes mistakes and that most of them can be forgiven. We have admins afaik who were once indef banned from the project, came back and proved that they have indeed learned from their mistakes. We should extend the same offer to Flameviper. We have banned him in 2007, more than 2 years ago now and I for one think that people can indeed mature in 2 years. Let&#39;s unban him, under conditions (see Durova above) and if he really starts acting up again, the block button is very easy to push. There is really nothing to lose here but we might gain a matured editor who knows their way around the project.

<li>I&#39;m of the same mind as Ironholds. I&#39;m not sure why aging from 12 to 15 and 7 months (which, btw, I have no idea how he did in two years) indicates a marked improvement in maturity, especially when we know how spectacularly poorly he behaved before. That said, I&#39;m mildly inclined to support unbanning per AGF, but with the basis that any repeat of the behavior for which he was banned results in an instant re-ban with no more chances. <i>÷<a href="" title="user:seresin">seresin</a></i> 00:57, 6 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Yes, it&#39;s a tad confusing, however, he was originally indefinitely blocked on 22 June 2006, then unblocked but had problems leading up to the reblock in February 2007 and I think when he says he was 12, he&#39;s referring to the period between those two blocks. In the letter I posted above he states he was 13 when banned in 2007, which would make him 14 in 2008 and 15 in 2009. I would certainly agree that any repeated bad behaviour should result in a no-second chances reblock. <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 05:21, 6 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Support unban.</b> I first ran into Flameviper on his 13th birthday, when I was asked to oversight an edit from him saying that it was his 13th birthday. We routinely oversight the ages of minors, so that was easy. I then encountered him in January of 2007, when some very gross edits were made from his account; I issued an emergency block, figuring he&#39;d left himself logged into a public terminal or something. For whatever reason, after that, he started making himself more and more obnoxious, leading to the community block, and a string of sockpuppets. I probably blocked some of those, seeing as how that&#39;s what I do to sockpuppets. When he managed to get himself unbanned, I double-checked to make sure he hadn&#39;t been socking again, and of course he had been, so door ass bang. A heck of a lot can happen between the ages of 12 and 16. Some people actually develop things like a sense of what is acceptable behavior. (Some never do.) Has Flameviper done so? I&#39;m willing to think he might have, at least enough for us to give him rope and see if he chooses to hang himself with it or instead help us build an encyclopedia. I think he needs to proceed as <a href="" title="User:Flameviper">User:Flameviper</a>, with an intact and honest history; if his return is successful, he will be a fine example of how a troublesome kid can return as a useful member of our community. If not? Minor annoyance, reban, end of story. --<a href="" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a>&#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Jpgordon">

<li><b>Support unban</b> - a good amount of time has passed and Flameviper seems to be genuinely repentant.

That said, he should be kept on a short leash - no leeway should be given in situations that in any way mimic the previous problems that lead up to the ban, and any regression toward those behaviors should be met with a quick reinstatement thereof.  Also, for what it is worth, I must echo <a href="" title="User:Jpgordon">jpgordon</a> and <a href="" title="User:Rockfang">Rockfang</a> in that I would prefer to see him unblocked as his original account (Flameviper) for the sake of an honest and transparent history with the project. <a href="" title="User:Shereth">&#60;b&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#0000FF&#34;&#62;Sher&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/b&#62;</a>&#60;b&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#6060BF&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Shereth">eth</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/b&#62; 17:42, 6 July 2009 (UTC)

I do know his list of socks and the sock category is not complete, since checkusers will often just block socks of ongoing annoyances without tagging their user pages.

<li>Of course he&#39;s willing to edit under the Flamviper account (and he can confirm this himself); he&#39;s just saying that it&#39;s his preference to use a different account. He&#39;s been banned for two-and-a-half years so he&#39;s not going to be stupid enough to quibble over accounts and refuse to edit as Flameviper. Please try not to get too hung up on the issue of the account. There&#39;s no policy reason I&#39;m aware of that would prevent the community or an administrator from allowing him to use his preferred account. Even people who have been sanctioned at arbitration for socking and restricted to one account have been allowed to choose their preferred account. One example that comes to mind is the account Privatemusings which was originally a sockpuppet, see this finding, <a href="#Privatemusings_limited_to_one_account" title="Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Privatemusings">limited to one account</a>. The important issue at hand is whether the person behind the Flameviper account should be given a second chance and if you&#39;re indifferent to him being unbanned then the matter of which account he would use doesn&#39;t matter, right. <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 07:50, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>Well, as I said yesterday there is precedent for it so it can be done and PM is one of a number of examples of users who were blocked or banned and eventually unbanned/unblocked and allowed to use what had been a sock as their primary account. As long as he&#39;s only using one account, I don&#39;t see the problem. Flameviper has confirmed he is willing to edit under Flameviper, he just prefers the other username. <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 05:11, 10 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>IMH(non-admin)O, I see consensus for unblock, but not unconditional, I do believe he requires a mentor. Would one of the admins who voted to support this young man step up and take on the job?

<dd>I agree he needs a mentor, but unfortunately due to other commitments I really don&#39;t think that I can take on mentorship. I&#39;m certainly willing to assist and I would make myself available to answer any questions and give him advice and assistance, but I think he needs a mentor who is around and available more than I am.

<dd>As a veteran <a href="" title="WP:ADOPT">adopter</a>, I would be more than happy to mentor/adopt Flameviper if I am chosen to take on the role.

<dd>As a latecomer to the discussion, I spotted this a few days ago and thought it would be a bad idea, given the history... comments since then have persuaded me that it&#39;s probably a mistake to hold such a young person&#39;s past against them forever. Such an eager contributor could be an asset, if things turn out well. Support here already appears nearly unanimous, but I&#39;d like to offer my own, as well. The several experienced editors who&#39;ve stepped up to offer mentorship should provide a healthy comfort zone for all involved. One question I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen addressed in full: would we unblocking Flameviper, or Ziggy Sawdust? My own slight preference is ZS, to use a name that is recognizable while still emphasizing a new beginning, but I&#39;m inclined to defer to the user&#39;s own preference. &#38;ndash; &#60;span style=&#34;font-family: Garamond&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Luna Santin">&#60;font color=&#34;#1E90FF&#34;&#62;<b>Luna Santin</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Luna Santin">talk</a>)&#60;/span&#62; 03:34, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>&#60;small&#62;Originally meant to be posted on Dylan&#39;s talk page, but I edit conflicted:&#60;/small&#62;Speaking as an uninvolved watcher here: I am just not sure if Dylan is ready to take over a mentorship role on the project. While I see that he have adopted users in the past, this really is a much bigger deal, and I think that it would be better if a more experienced editor volunteered for this. I mean no offense towards him; I just think he need more experience before he can undertake such a task of mentoring a previously-banned user. &#60;font color=&#34;navy&#34;&#62;<b><a href="" title="User:NuclearWarfare">NW</a>&#60;/font&#62;</b> <i>(&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:NuclearWarfare">Talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;)</i> 23:01, 10 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Because why? He cannot recognize if Flameviper goes disruptive and he needs to ask for a re-block at ANI? I think he is experienced enough to check a contribs list for problems.

<dd>Thank you to all the volunteers, especially to Firestorm. I was just looking at Dylan&#39;s pages as a couple of people have expressed concerns with making Dylan the mentor and I noticed on his <a href="" title="User:Dylan620/Adoption">adoption page</a> it says he has 7 mentorees - is that right?? If so, I think he has plenty already and we should just ask Shell to do it. I also don&#39;t think it&#39;s really ideal to have a mentor who needs co-mentors. I think we just need someone who is experienced with users with difficult backgrounds and I would really like to see Shell to do it, if she is willing. I also plan to be around and help as much as I can and honestly having a team seems a tad like over-doing it and I wouldn&#39;t like Ziggy to feel intimidated by a gang of mentors. Just a thought and I will leave it up to the murderous puppy if she is going to do the close. <a href="" title="User talk:Sarah">Sarah</a> 10:18, 11 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, only two of those adoptees are active (and I&#39;ll be adding a third page later on), so I can handle one more. To Durova and Sarah above; I just feel more comfortable working with Mazca. While Mazca and I have interacted previously, this is the first time I&#39;ve ever met Shell, so I feel more comfortable working with Mazca.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Topic_ban_proposal_for_.7B.7Buser.7D.7D">Topic ban proposal for  </span></h2>

<p><b>Comment</b>: <i>This was posted on the Incidents page and I have moved it here after I was told that the Incidents page wasn&#39;t the right place for this request.</i></p><hr/>
<p>I am proposing a topic ban for   on <a href="" title="Kosovo">Kosovo</a>-related articles. Kosovo is an article and area of interest under probation by the Arbitration Committee. Not only has this user blatantly engaged in edit warring on the Kosovo page, for which he was blocked twice (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;type=block&#38;page=User:Interestedinfairness" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;type=block&#38;page=User:Interestedinfairness">block log</a>), but he has ignored every single argument that does not support his own POV. Many users have accused him of POV pushing and he has shown complete unwillingness to respect other people&#39;s opinions.</p>
<p>The most recent incident, however, is just too much. After a marathon discussion in the <a href="" title="Talk:Kosovo">Talk:Kosovo</a> page, Interestedinfairness realized that there was no consensus to call Kosovo a country in the lead sentence, but changed it anyways (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kosovo&#38;diff=300895526&#38;oldid=300683618" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kosovo&#38;diff=300895526&#38;oldid=300683618">link</a>), just because he &#34;knows&#34; this to be a fact and nothing else matters. While the dispute here is that Albanians (and those who support them) see Kosovo as a country or state and Serbs (and those who support them) see Kosovo as a province, a long standing consensus was reached to call Kosovo a disputed region or territory, since this is as true as the Alps are a mountain range and it offends no one. However, Interestedinfairness (who speaks Albanian and has the Albanian coat of arms on his userpage) was so bent on pushing his own POV that other users got sick of it as well, and this is evident on the talk page.</p>
<p>This user is currently blocked for the 3rd time for edit warring on the <a href="" title="Illyrians">Illyrians</a> article - same story: It&#39;s either his way, or the highway. What&#39;s worse, some 12 hours after this user was blocked, another user,   (whose username, in a way, has the same message as &#34;interested in fairness&#34;) was created and continued &#34;defending Interestedinfairness&#39; views&#34; on the Kosovo talk page. He even went on to give Interestedinfairness a little barn star :P This is probably a case of <a href="" title="WP:SOCK">sockpuppetry</a>, as one administrator said on that talk page, so it would be a good idea to check.</p>
<p>If this was a one time thing, I wouldn&#39;t be reporting this. Some users just don&#39;t understand how Wikipedia works at first, but then adjust to the five pillars and contribute in a constructive way. This user had his chance and he did not change at all. He did promise to change, but he didn&#39;t, which just doesn&#39;t make his promises credible anymore.

<p>This user has been active for a long time. He has been explained everything several times. He was blocked when he couldn&#39;t control himself, and he&#39;s blocked for the third time. Several users agree on a topic ban. He was given several chances, but his latest incident showed that he has learned nothing. Believe me, all other options have been exhausted. Take a look at his contributions and every talk page he has written on - it&#39;s all there. A complete unwillingness to cooperate. Any further threats will simply get him to make new promises which he&#39;ll break, just like he did the previous ones. He is here for one reason and for one reason only - to push his POV to the end. --<a href="" title="User:Cinéma C">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;<b><i>Cin</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:crimson&#34;&#62;<b>é</b>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;<b><i>ma</i></b> &#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:crimson&#34;&#62;<b><i>C</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> 03:10, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>Friend, I&#39;ve always provided reasons for my edits. I have noted in several places that the sources used by some users are not acceptable according to <a href="" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. I feel your comment is irresponsible, User:Ricky. Please check the history of the article. </p>
<p>I did not revert the sources because I do not agree with them. If you check my recent edit, you will see that I used one source user:Tadija had provided (the council of foreign relations one). I also kept her main point; that the said person was considered a terrorist by Serbia at the time of the war, but also by the UK and America, but that this was quickly withdrawn.</p>
<p>My edit enriched the article with useful information about the manner in which Adem Jashari was killed, and the resultant effect it had in starting the Kosovo war. </p>
<p>Also, I should note that user:Tadija is not an native-English speaker, no offense intended, but her edits are usually poorly constructed and hammer home a specific point throughout the lead.</p>
<p>Calling Adem Jashari a &#34;war criminal&#34; when he has never been convicted (even by a Serbian court) shows the level of immaturity and POV pushing attempted by some users. </p>
<p>Furthermore, all the good Wikipedians can see that the animosity towards me is only based on POV issues and nothing related to Wikipedia policy.</p> 
<p>Proposal to drop this case.

<dd>Looking at the amount of revenues the Foundation is getting, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an issue of not having enough money; it&#39;s more like an issue of how effectively that money is being spent.

<dd>There are 5-8 people with hardware responsibilities that are paid by the Foundation (only a couple of whom have hardware as their primary responsibility).  In addition there are another handful of volunteers with hardware level access.  Beyond them there are ~100 or so volunteer software developers.  The hardware workers need to maintain ~350 or so physical machines on three continents.  Not an easy task.  In addition, the fact that WMF generally gets ~2/3 of their annual income during the two month fundraiser often encourages bulk hardware purchases to be clustered as well, with purchases at other times being more targeted to specific needs.  Unfortunately, sometimes those needs are not adequately anticipated.  That appears to have been the case here.  You say that in a more accountable organization people would be fired on the spot.  That might be true.  But every one of the other top-10 global websites has revenues at least 20 times what Wikipedia recieves in donations.  We don&#39;t have the resources to dismiss dedicated workers over mistakes like this, nor should we want to.  <a href="" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dragons flight">talk</a>) 18:45, 12 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>How anyone, without knowing the background on this, could call for the firings of employees is beyond me. Aside from that, Wikipedia&#39;s reach and traffic are leveraged far, far beyond its capitalization, mostly because there is more or less no commercial risk in doing so. This is a wonderful way for a privately owned foundation to put forth free content, but it comes at a cost, which is the likelihood of downtime now and then. <a href="" title="User:Gwen Gale">Gwen Gale</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gwen Gale">talk</a>) 20:01, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<dd>No, questioning is just fine. Spewing acid in the face of sysadmins, part volunteers, who maintain one of the largest and most complex websites on the internet on a low budget in a way that has been praised by professionals, by someone who has absolutely 0 clue about how the technology is run, ... that is simply disrespectful to say the least. To counter risks like these (a full Internet eXchange going down, running into a vague performance bug), the budget for technology would have to be tripled or quadrupled at least, and possibly even more. It is perfectly fine to ask questions, but you are passing judgement on stuff you know clearly jack about. If you did know anything about this, you would be there helping solve the problem. —<a href="" title="User:TheDJ">Th&#60;span style=&#34;color: green&#34;&#62;e&#60;/span&#62;DJ</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a>) 21:12, 12 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

When more redundancy or other measures are needed to prevent fallout like this in the future, I&#39;m sure such measures will be taken.

<li>Agreed.  When I was in college taking History of the English language, we had to write an extensive paper on lexicon and morphology based on a single source.  I used the <a href="" title="Oxford English Dictionary">OED</a> and wrote a few thousand words on &#34;cuss words&#34;.  Bottom line from that applies to this: the word shit exists because it evolved from the Anglo-Saxon root &#34;scythe&#34; which in turn goes back to Indo-European roots.  &#34;Bad words&#34; do provide an educational opportunity.  <a href="" title="User:Keegan">Keegan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Keegan">talk</a>) 21:11, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>

<p>As the pejorative of the article states in it’s introduction, “…..&#34;it is one of the few remaining words in the English language with a genuine power to shock.&#34;</p>
<p>It goes on… “The word &#34;cunt&#34; is generally regarded in English-speaking countries as unsuitable in normal public discourse and has been described as &#34;the most heavily tabooed word of all English words.” </p>
<p>So it’s shocking, offensive and unsuitable in normal public use and has managed to disenfranchise thousands of academic and business users due to the <a href="" title="Scunthorpe problem">Scunthorpe problem</a> and people can defend it being stuck up on the homepage! </p>

<dd>You should try Scotland ;-) I grew up partly in England, and moved to Scotland when I was 18 - I was shocked at how often it&#39;s possible to get &#34;cunt&#34; into one sentence. &#34;Nae cunt&#34; is a common idiom, equivalent to &#34;no one&#34; in regular English - think more &#34;nae cunt&#39;s at the bar&#34;, rather than &#34;nae cunt talks to me like that&#34;. On the whole I found England much more refined - I&#39;ve heard folk respond to &#34;cunt&#34; with &#34;don&#39;t f****** use language like that in front of me, you b******&#34;...and that&#39;s more than enough bad language for me today.

<p>Oh no, it&#39;s on the front page. So we&#39;re basically sparing kids an extra click to search for &#34;cunt&#34;, right?

<dd>I don&#39;t think the problem is kids, but people who&#39;re fundamentally decent, not particularly stuck up or prudish, and nevertheless <i>don&#39;t</i> like to be unexpectedly presented with words like &#34;cunt&#34;. Will nobody think of the parents? I will happily exchange swear words with the next guy, but I think this was a poor choice for our front page, and this position shouldn&#39;t be confused with being pro-censorship.

<dd>Aye. I&#39;ve been arguing the toss for much of today with the &#34;won&#39;t somebody please think of the children?&#34;-brigade, but a few sensible complaints have emerged:
<ul>
<li>Placement. Fair enough we reward article improvement by promoting articles to FA status, but we could handle this better. One idea I had was to replace the article &#34;teaser text&#34; and title with a banner explaining that &#34;Today&#39;s FA may be considered offensive, and readers may wish to exercise caution etc etc yada yada&#34;. The banner would link to the article.</li>
<li>Filters. In a perfect world corporations and schools would have sane filters, and they&#39;d trust their employees and students. In an imperfect world large swathes of academia, at least, will have been prevented from viewing Wikipedia today, without students/academics typing in direct URLs.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>I&#39;m not saying I agree or disagree with either of these issues, but there <i>are</i> issues beyond &#34;OMG! Censorship!&#34; and &#34;OMG! Think of the children!&#34;.</dd>

<dd>I agree with Exploding Boy here, while I am sure that the editor/s who brought the article up to FA standard had a few private laughs, the article is nonetheless presented in an encyclopedic way.

<dd>Absolutely. But to accomplish that, we certainly don&#39;t need to stuff them in peoples&#39; faces right when they open the site. Look, I grew up around loggers, mechanics, truck drivers, and such; I&#39;ve got a vocabulary that would probably put anyone vaguely squeamish in their graves. I don&#39;t have an issue with the word. It&#39;s the image that&#39;s my concern. Fact is: people *will* be offended (note the comments from Stifle about OTRS, note the thread on <a href="" title="Talk:Main Page">Talk:Main Page</a>, et al), even if the word in question *is* less stigmatized outside of North America, and that needs to be something that we consider in our choices for the front page. <a href="" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 20:15, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

<p>One of the more fascinating aspects of Wikipedia is how reading up on one topic often leads to clicking a link to another, and another, and another.  So here today, we have a rather interesting article - one of the more interesting FA&#39;s I&#39;ve seen in a while on the main page regardless of the name - that is going to draw people in.  Obviously it will draw them in because &#34;OMG! they said cunt! he he he he!&#34;, but many of those very same children we are trying to think about are going to end up clicking on <a href="" title="London">London</a>, <a href="" title="England">England</a>, etc, and start reading about ...tamer... history.  That, of course, is a good thing.   Or, in short, everyone complaining about the use of a word is missing the point.  TFA is intended to draw people in.

<li>What has annoyed me about this whole debate is that a number of people who have expressed concerns with this (including me) have pointed out that it&#39;s not about keeping this kind of thing away from the kids, it&#39;s about an image issue, and yet most of the response has been claiming an attempt to censor or lay a chilling effect down or something similar. One comment asks why Americans are so puritanical about sex; it&#39;s not about sex, it&#39;s about a common vulgarity that a lot of people don&#39;t like to hear, read or disseminate, and here it is splashed onto the front page of one of the world&#39;s most trafficed web pages. I&#39;m firmly against censorship, I&#39;m strongly in the camp of &#39;sex is normal and natural and should be taught to kids responsibly,&#39; so being lumped into a general group of &#39;censorship because of sex&#39; - which, around here, renders any concerns from that particular group moot - frankly pisses me off.

<p>I&#39;d like to request an IP user be blocked after repeatedly changing statistics without source citations and re-adding inappropriate external links after repeated reversions and warnings.  User is IP 208.104.139.77.  Edits have been mainly to <a href="" title="Rock Hill, South Carolina">Rock Hill, South Carolina</a> but also includes <a href="" title="Hampden, Maine">Hampden, Maine</a> and <a href="" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a>.  Constant edits to add external links.  Most do not seem to be promotional spam so this is unlikely clasified as vandalism, but rather listing lots of individual businesses that just happen to be in a city within that city&#39;s articles (WP is not a link farm and the primary subject of sparse EL&#39;s should about the main subject which would be the city), plus adding lots of links to weather websites for each city, all of which is inappropriate external links.  Also repeatedly changes the population statistics of different city articles without any citations.  Even worse, they leave the old citations in which then become false citations that do not support the content.</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to request a block of IP 208.104.139.77.  Again, I don&#39;t think you&#39;d consider this intentional vandalism but they are repeatedly ignoring warnings both on their user page and in the edit comments.  Plus this is just an unregistered IP address.  I figure if they really want to keep editing on Wikipedia they have to learn to listen to what other editors are telling them (not just me BTW) and it wouldn&#39;t hurt them to register a username either.</p>

I don&#39;t know if it is a right place to write about a Wiki Commons problem or not?

There was not any problem till I put some of them in an article in the Persian Wikipedia. Then I noticed that all those images were deleted in the Commons. It sounds like a Persian Wikipedia administrator who also has administrator&#39;s access to the Commons has deleted those pictures to Censor the Wikipedia! Since it is a very big abuse of Administratorship, I demand immediate investigation and punishmet of the faulty person.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="GFDL.2C_copyvio_and_moves">GFDL, copyvio and moves</span></h2>

<p>After getting involved in a minor move war I have noticed that <a href="" title="U-boat Campaign (World War I)">U-boat Campaign (World War I)</a> started rather abruptly with a huge chunk of text. Some of this (a minority) is based on <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Atlantic_(1914%E2%80%931918)&#38;action=history" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Battle_of_the_Atlantic_(1914%E2%80%931918)&#38;action=history">the history of Battle of the Atlantic (1914&#38;ndash;1918)</a> which was a huge copyvio. My question: should they be history merged given the copyvio nature of the old text?

<dl>
<dd>No, history merges shouldn&#39;t be done unless the two versions are the same or very nearly so. A note on the talk page of <a href="" title="U-boat Campaign (World War I)">U-boat Campaign (World War I)</a> will be enough. However it would be a good idea to keep the edits from the Atlantic article around for attribution purposes. If that&#39;s not possible, then cut and paste the attributions from the page history and note them on the talk page. <b><a href="" title="User:Graham87">Graham</a></b>&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Graham87">87</a>&#60;/font&#62; 13:27, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Exploding Boy is correct, that it is not truly an oversight issue. It is, however, a biography of a non-notable person (she works at a fine arts auction house now, and was a presenter on what was then a very small cable TV channel) that has more BLP-violating versions than one can shake a stick at and, when taking out the BLP-violating material, the rest is poorly sourced.

I believe this entire thread is complete nonsense, it was opened because I didn&#39;t respond within ten minutes because I was at the local Walmart preparing for a camping trip. AFDS are for a community discussion and clearly these malls are not notable. Just because they eist does not give them notability. The American mall or greeat mall that has an amusement park now thats notable. This is just a chance to toot a local horn.

<dd>Well, since you asked... While I agree that it might have been nice to give you more time to respond to the most recent query, after TPH raised the mall question on your talk page, instead of answering him, you sent another mall article to AfD. So I can also understand why he might think you were ignoring him altogether. As to why others (myself included) are concerned, well, the problem of CSD tags isn&#39;t exactly new to you. <a href="#Speedy_reasons" title="User_talk:Hell_in_a_Bucket">User_talk:Hell_in_a_Bucket</a> had quite a bit of information for you about what can be speedied (although ThaddeusB got notability and importance mixed up). <a href="#Splurve_Ball" title="User_talk:Hell_in_a_Bucket">User_talk:Hell_in_a_Bucket</a> had another mention of inappropriate CSD tagging. The concern is that after these two events (and possibly more under your old username -- I don&#39;t feel like looking), most editors would get a clue and read <a href="" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> carefully. My good faith opinion is to take a few minutes to read <a href="" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>, <a href="" title="WP:BEFORE">WP:BEFORE</a> and <a href="" title="WP:DEL">WP:DEL</a>.

<dd>I have been trying to advise Hell in a Bucket for some time now, and we have butted heads several times.  That said, I do think he is acting in good faith and he does seem to be improving.  I have tried to explain to him several times that being not notable isn&#39;t a speedy deletion criteria and that being &#34;important&#34; isn&#39;t the same thing as being notable.  He still doesn&#39;t seem to comprehend our policies fully (<a href="" title="WP:AGF">assuming good faith</a>), but I do feel he has at least tried to improve.  Still, it might be in his own best interest to concentrate on areas outside of deletion until he gets a better handle on our policies - and that is what I&#39;d advise. --<a href="" title="User:ThaddeusB">ThaddeusB</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ThaddeusB">talk</a>) 23:04, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Comment</b> To add to what <a href="" title="User:TenPoundHammer">User:TenPoundHammer</a> has said,I have observed many of the AfDs Hell in a Bucket has brought up, and most fall in the two extremes, either easy deletes or easy keeps. Not much of the borderline cases which leads me to believe that he doesn&#39;t understand the <a href="" title="WP:Note">notability guidelines</a> or the <a href="" title="WP:Before">process of bringing something to AfD</a>. Also some of the CSD taggings are plain absurd, as in the case of <a href="" title="Ellie Cole">Ellie Cole</a>, where there was also a misplaced 3RR warning and his arguments at the AfD. Also, another series of AfDs started with <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Global Adjustments">Global Adjustments</a> - three AfDs within six minutes, one of them within five minutes of the article being created and another within a minute of the article being created, clearly indicating that there was no effort to check on anything before nominating for deletion. While there&#39;s enough speediable material created out there to give a good success rate, some of them are disruptive. Until such time when he understands the processes, it&#39;s possibly best to either set a limit on his CSD tags per day and an AfD limit per week, if not an outright break from these activities for a while. -<a href="" title="User:Spaceman7Spiff">SpacemanSpiff</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Spaceman7Spiff">talk</a>) 00:53, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support Hell</b>  My initial impression was that I did not like Hell in a Bucket.  Hell wrongly or too quickly nominated stuff for deletion.  However, after writing to him, the matter was resolved.  Therefore, my interactions with Hell is that Hell is an ok person, not a troublemaker.  Everyone should work together to resolve things. <a href="" title="User:User F203">User F203</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:User F203">talk</a>) 18:12, 10 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Aye, my initial opinion of Hell was poor, but a bad situation involving Hell was resolved, and Hell seems to have learned from the experience, and demonstrated that they&#39;re capable of learning and moving on. I suspect Hell still has much to learn, but I equally suspect that they are more than capable of doing so. I think Hell is in the wrong here - but I also think they&#39;ll come to realise that, too.

<li>Wow, let me just reconfirm my opinion that this entire thread is idiotic. Yes I am completely calm, but an ani thread because I was gone shopping? Pretty flipping stupid. Thank everyone who defended me that I attempt to be a reasonable person. The entire reason I removed the comments on the page was because Ten Pound Hammer, <b>was trolling</b> and I call things how I see it. I did leave him the option to comeback when he was willing to talk out an issue. He choose to keep throwing everything but the kitchen sinks in links and accusations and I won&#39;t put up with B.S. like that without saying my peace which has admittedly gotten me significant grief then it is worth, so I removed them. I do plan on continuing using CSD&#39;s and AFD&#39;s however as I do tell the people who actually listen to what I say without twisting things, I will continue to learn and progress more ni accordance with wikipedia policies (to which I do not know them all). If anyone doesn&#39;t like that, I can frankly care less because I am a human and prone to error. <a href="" title="User:Hell in a Bucket">Hell In A Bucket</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hell in a Bucket">talk</a>) 01:43, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>  
The fact that this is also related to Andy Murray (see couple of threads above) is purely coincidental. I was checking deletion logs of images transferred to commons as I periodically do and stumbled on something I simply don&#39;t understand. (The following links will require admin rights).
Okay there was an original image (30 August 2006) that was rightly deleted as vandalism because it wasn&#39;t Murray. The file history says <a href="" title="User:Crassic">User:Crassic</a> uploaded the file again (24 June 2007) but the page history doesn&#39;t record any addition of source, license etc. by that user. However it does record <a href="" title="User:Lactics">User:Lactics</a> <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&#38;target=File%3AAndymurray.jpg&#38;timestamp=20070624143215&#38;diff=prev" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Undelete&#38;target=File%3AAndymurray.jpg&#38;timestamp=20070624143215&#38;diff=prev">adding these details</a> at exactly the same time as the upload was made (supposedly by Crassic). Despite the file history suggesting to the contrary, Crassic has <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Crassic" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Crassic">no contributions</a> or <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:DeletedContributions/Crassic" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:DeletedContributions/Crassic">deleted contribs</a>.

<dd>Actually, different font environments even in the same browser.

<dd>A single character name seems problematic, and maybe UfA might be interested.   But in principle weird fonts is your problem, not that editor&#39;s, and the Username might e perfectly good.  (The editors real name, for example), and thus username policy would tend to allow weird fonts.  OBVIOUSLY being foreign doesn&#39;t remove need for complaince with rest of policies.

<dd>Request for comment usernames (or whatever the board is called) has had much discussion about this.  as far as I can tell &#39;consensus&#39; was that usernames can e in any characterset, but must meet traditional guidelines (email addresses are unwise, don&#39;t impersonate anyone else, no racial slurs etc etc) but that it&#39;d be lovely if the editor also had some kind of &#34;ENGLISH&#34; sig.  I use scare quots for consensus ecause some editors were reluctant for the new policy, feeling forced into it by unified login.  A n ew RfC addressing usernames, and sigs, and consequences of poor choices for either, would probably be useful at some point to clear up some evolved weirdness in various overlapping policies. <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/87.113.86.207">87.113.86.207</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:87.113.86.207">talk</a>) 17:42, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

I am indeed trying to do my best to be non-intrusive, I&#39;ve talked with the Wikipedia Research Network and used their suggestions, but as of now there is no truely &#34;legitimate&#34; way to conduct a survey in Wikipedia.  -<a href="" title="User:CMUResearcher">CMUResearcher</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:CMUResearcher">talk</a>) 21:37, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>So who, exactly, is conducting this study? I see no names whatsoever, whether grad student, doctoral candidate, principal investigator, or faculty advisor. And the outside website used for gathering data -- I would have thought Carnegie-Mellon, of all places, might have the ability to pull together a functional webpage -- gives me enormous pause. A simple note to OTRS or the Foundation was too difficult? --<a href="" title="User:Calton">Calton</a> | <a href="" title="User talk:Calton">Talk</a> 17:28, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Calton, I&#39;ve updated my userpage with a list of all the names of the people on our research team, I hope that is satisfactory!  As to creating a survey and card sort from scratch when the software to do that is freely available, we&#39;d like to spend time building software and developing solutions to issues, not reinventing ways of collecting data.  -<a href="" title="User:CMUResearcher">CMUResearcher</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:CMUResearcher">talk</a>) 21:37, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dd>I see the website is quite cited on English Wikipedia, a search reveals 869 links. I was inspired by what was written in the article and I processed the info by myself. In that initial post I brought some serious facts that need discussion. I have hoped a discussion about the lack of interest in dealing with the paid editing and about the monsters that it produced, rather than this initiative of Triplestop, to put racism in front (it is just one of the issues), hoping to avoid such a discussion. <a href="" title="User:Cinagua">Cinagua</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cinagua">talk</a>) 07:30, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dd>Let me clarify, why is the self-published (which I take as being the reason behind the word &#34;publish&#34; as the server) part of such a website being used as fact or useful? There are only 16 links to publish.indymedia.org, most of which are mirrors of this page.

When navigating through that website it is likely to get the articles&#39; links with &#34;publish&#34; in front, for example when searching keywords.

<p>Hello, Admins! I just want you all to go and look to see if the fansite link on Andy Murray&#39;s external links is approprate. Further, go and look at the talk page to see the debate! I am looking for Admin attention because they are trying to make a unique exception for this tennis player, which I don&#39;t think I have ever saw a fansite in external links before on any article not just tennis players. So, just go look at this and determine if this meets wikipedia&#39;s criteria! A similar fansite <a class="externallink" href="http://www.goroger.net/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.goroger.net/">http://www.goroger.net/</a> is not include on <a href="" title="Roger Federer">Roger Federer</a>&#39;s page for good reason because it is a fansite, but it has authority and credibility like <a class="externallink" href="http://www.murraysworld.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.murraysworld.com/">http://www.murraysworld.com/</a> is asserting to get there&#39;s included here.

<dd>This one looks a bit different.  The fansite owner was responsible for heavy pushing to include his link.  AGF he thinks it&#39;s useful, and has made reference to his site being quoted by BBC, Sky, and some newspapers.  There was confusion between external links and sources, but the link is now only used as an external link.  Finally, there seems to be some (AbadF) &#39;odd&#39; editing by some new editors.  So perhaps someone could have a closer look? <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/87.113.86.207">87.113.86.207</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:87.113.86.207">talk</a>) 23:32, 15 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Don&#39;t know when I first noticed, feels like a few weeks on a slow burn, but it seems to be ramping up and certainly seems to be the very definition of wikistalking.   noms numerous items, articles, redirects, etc. that   created or works on for deletion and then, when they aren&#39;t deleted, works at removing content that just survived the XfD. I don&#39;t care <i>why</i> they feel this behaviour is acceptable - it clearly isn&#39;t. Could some non-involved folks take a look and see if this is alarming? Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) has stated in numerous XfDs that this sure feels like being wikistalked. Personally I would take that as a strong hint to back off. <a href="" title="User_talk:Benjiboi">-- &#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px; font-family: cursive;color:#8000FF&#34;&#62;Banj&#60;font color=&#34;#FF4400&#34;&#62;e&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;&#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px;font-family: Zapfino, sans-serif;color:deeppink&#34;&#62;b&#60;font color=&#34;#CC0000&#34;&#62;oi&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;</a> 07:34, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Hmm, I just noticed this too - on checking today&#39;s RfD log every current nomination is one of RAN&#39;s redirects nominated by Drawn Some. Most of them are at least vaguely reasonable rationales, but it&#39;s still rather worrying and does suggest an element of wikistalking. ~ &#60;font color=&#34;#228b22&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Mazca"><b>m</b>a<b>z</b>c<b>a</b></a>&#60;/font&#62; &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Mazca">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 07:52, 14 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I feel rather involved as being pretty active with the Article Rescue Squad which Drawn Some seems to not approve, I think Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) also does ARS work but I only pay so much attention unless something seems troubling, like this situation. Clearing out unneeded items is fine, within reason - they are just redirects so really I&#39;m not sure I agree with the urgency to removed them. Coupled with an ongoing pattern and Richard Arthur Norton (1958- ) statements they feel wikistalked I would say there&#39;s no winners here. IMHO Drawn Some should simply disengage and walk away. <a href="" title="User_talk:Benjiboi">-- &#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px; font-family: cursive;color:#8000FF&#34;&#62;Banj&#60;font color=&#34;#FF4400&#34;&#62;e&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;&#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px;font-family: Zapfino, sans-serif;color:deeppink&#34;&#62;b&#60;font color=&#34;#CC0000&#34;&#62;oi&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;</a> 08:01, 14 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>It does seem odd to start something like <a href="#Richard_Arthur_Norton_.281958-_.29" title="Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts">Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts</a> and to then mass nominate redirects of that user for deletion.  Why complain about an editor and then when the complaint doesn&#39;t build momentum start targetting the articles or redirects he has worked on?  You would think if Drawn Some really was concerned about Richard, Drawn Some would avoid him, not of the millions of articles and redirects we have make it a point to go after those created by Richard.  After all, you will not see me start nominating articles an editor I am in conflict with created for deletion as doing so would be needless escalation if not counter to the purpose of the complaint.

<li>To be fair, I was the one that told him to go to <a href="" title="WP:WQA">WP:WQA</a>, as he seemed to feel the stalking claims were unjustified and I figured that would involve a third party. --<a href="" title="User:Smashville"><b>Smashville</b></a><a href="" title="User Talk:Smashville">&#60;sup style=&#34;color:#03F&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 14:00, 16 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>I&#39;ve unarchived this as it seems to be continuing. I find this wikihounding behaviour quite distasteful, is someone neutral willing to look into this and encourage Drawn Some to disengage? Or any other ideas? <a href="" title="User_talk:Benjiboi">-- &#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px; font-family: cursive;color:#8000FF&#34;&#62;Banj&#60;font color=&#34;#FF4400&#34;&#62;e&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;&#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px;font-family: Zapfino, sans-serif;color:deeppink&#34;&#62;b&#60;font color=&#34;#CC0000&#34;&#62;oi&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;</a> 12:17, 16 July 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>All I see from the past few days is that DrawnSome is nominating a lot of articles and redirects created by Richard Arthur Norton for deletion. I could find no other related behaviour. Since many of the AfD&#39;s and RfD&#39;s are agreed upon by different unrelated users, it seems that he is often correct in nominating those. This means that what he is currently doing is not wikihounding, but proper use of someone&#39;s contribution list: if you believe that someone is making a lot of articles or redirects which don&#39;t belong here, it is acceptable to go through those and list them at the appropriate fora. If your opinion is often supported by consensus, there is no problem with continuing this behaviour. That the person who created these articles and redirects does not like this and describes it as wikihounding is irrelevant. One should not ignore problems to spare the feelings of another editor. <a href="" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Fram">talk</a>) 14:25, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>I agree wholeheartly with <a href="" title="User:Fram">Fram</a>&#39;s analysis above. Surely Drawn Some could be a little more diplomatic in some of comments to/about RAN, but none the less, given RAN&#39;s history of creating articles which ultimately get killed at AfD or RfD,  examining the articles he&#39;s created seems like a good way to root out non-notable articles and questionable redirects. It&#39;d be one thing if DS was XfDing articles which had no chance of being deleted, but in this case the consensus of mostly uninvolved editors is that DS is correct in nominating them for deletion. So let&#39;s all A-a little-GF and stop second-guessing his motives. <a href="" title="User:Yilloslime">Yilloslime</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Yilloslime">&#60;small&#62;<b>T</b>&#60;/small&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;sub style=&#34;margin-left:-1.040ex;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Yilloslime"><b>&#60;small&#62;C&#60;/small&#62;</b></a>&#60;/sub&#62; 19:34, 16 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>Somewhere there&#39;s a lovely line about AGF is not a suicide pact. I think there is more to it than just Drawn Some&#39;s concern for removing non-notable content - all apparently from the hands of RAN. These XfD&#39;s seem split and mostly in the gray areas, IMHO, with deletion likely not needed in any of them. I feel my part was to seek wider input and I have done so. If the community feels this is acceptable then I guess we will all live with where this leads. <a href="" title="User_talk:Benjiboi">-- &#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px; font-family: cursive;color:#8000FF&#34;&#62;Banj&#60;font color=&#34;#FF4400&#34;&#62;e&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;&#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px;font-family: Zapfino, sans-serif;color:deeppink&#34;&#62;b&#60;font color=&#34;#CC0000&#34;&#62;oi&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;</a> 02:12, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>Benjiboi, you stated at the 16th that the problem was ongoing, I then checked his contribs from the two days between the initial post here and the &#34;ongoing&#34; post, and could not find a real problem in them. You claim that the WQA disagrees with me by quoting posts from the 8th of July... So I ask you again, what is the <i>ongoing</i> problem, which edits from between the 14th and today do you have problems with? You claim now that on his XfD&#39;s, &#34;deletion [is] likely not needed in any of them&#34;. But looking at them, I see <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Reuben Wilmarth Hills III">1</a>,<a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Keith McDuffee">2</a>,<a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Simon Addis">3</a>,<a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Peter Pumyea II">4</a>,<a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Unbearable Lightness">5</a> all are headed for deletion at the moment. OF the redirects he nominated, the one <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2009 July 15">here</a> may be in a grey area so far, and of the 7 he nominated <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Redirects for discussion/Log/2009 July 14">here</a>, 2 are in the gray area, the other 5 are headed straight for deletion as well. <a href="" title="User:Fram">Fram</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Fram">talk</a>) 07:44, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<li>Not to belabour this further the issue isn&#39;t that between two set dates <i>X</i> and <i>Y</i> occurred but that an overall pattern seems evident.

I tagged that article for notability, without nominating it for deletion, and noted that it seemed to violate <a href="" title="WP:NOT">not a directory</a>, since lists of soldiers are usually far more select. I now note that RAN was the creator of the article listing a few Revolutionary War officers from New Jersey. I was not aware of any history between Drawn Some and Richard Arthur Norton when I questioned the appropriateness of the article, but a miscellaneous list of individuals of only genealogical interest does not become encyclopedic just because someone is targeting unencyclopedic articles created by an individual. If a lot of articles created by some editor get deleted in AFD, that is a signal that they should comply with guidelines when deciding what articles to create and stop creating inappropriate articles. If a lot of the AFD nominations by an editor are resulting in &#34;Keep&#34; then that editor is nomininating inappropriately. An individual article or AFD nomination should be judged on its merits regardless of who created the article or did the nomination. <a href="" title="User:Edison">Edison</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Edison">talk</a>) 15:39, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>I don&#39;t care which users are involved or even if RAN earned some extra scrutiny by being uncivil. I would be troubled by anyone accusing someone of maliciously creating articles then digging through their contribution and finding only borderline cases bringing those to XfD in what appears to be harassment. From what I can see these are borderline cases, the redirects were placed to do exactly what redirects do, same with the disambiguation pages. The notability of some of these bios certainly is not well spelled out. There is little evidence that RAN is maliciously causing problems deserving of Drawn Some&#39;s campaign - which seems to stem from a fallout they&#39;ve had in X-Y country Bilateral relationship articles - and Drawn Some&#39;s efforts to XfD RAN&#39;s work has resulted in just as many keeps and merges as deletes. My point remains is that this seems textbook wikihounding and should be discouraged. Wikipedia is not a battleground and Drawn Some certainly seems to be engaged in rather pointy XfD&#39;ing against RAN. I would feel the same about <i>any</i> two users or even if RAN was doing this to Drawn Some. <a href="" title="User_talk:Benjiboi">-- &#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px; font-family: cursive;color:#8000FF&#34;&#62;Banj&#60;font color=&#34;#FF4400&#34;&#62;e&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;&#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px;font-family: Zapfino, sans-serif;color:deeppink&#34;&#62;b&#60;font color=&#34;#CC0000&#34;&#62;oi&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;</a> 18:27, 17 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>All looks fine to me - if the AFDs were bad and being rejected out of hand, we&#39;d have a problem but examining another user&#39;s list and then noming many of the articles they have created (because they are unsuitable) seems a perfectly acceptable way to make use of that information. --<a href="" title="User:Cameron Scott">Cameron Scott</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cameron Scott">talk</a>) 18:37, 17 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>(ec) I dunno. If I were Drawn Some, to demonstrate good faith I&#39;d put this XfD effort on hold for a while. All of these comments suggest RAN is not unreasonable in his concern at this, &#38; maybe a brief respite would lead him to realize that Drawn Some isn&#39;t doing this out of malice.

<dd>That&#39;s a great idea!  Wikipedia is such a big place, there is no real need or reason to have to nominate or go after articles created or worked on by an particular editor, especially when concerns arise and as if anything is seriously worth nominating someone else will notice anyway.
