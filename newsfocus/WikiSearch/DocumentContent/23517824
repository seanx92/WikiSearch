<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Nomination">Nomination</span></h4>
<p> &#38;nbsp;– Today I am here to present Juliancolton to the community for consideration for the userright of bureaucrat.  Julian has been an editor since <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&#38;type=newusers&#38;user=&#38;page=User%3AJuliancolton&#38;year=&#38;month=-1&#38;tagfilter=" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&#38;type=newusers&#38;user=&#38;page=User%3AJuliancolton&#38;year=&#38;month=-1&#38;tagfilter=">November 18, 2006</a> and an admin since <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&#38;type=rights&#38;user=Rlevse&#38;page=User%3AJuliancolton&#38;year=&#38;month=-1&#38;tagfilter=" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&#38;type=rights&#38;user=Rlevse&#38;page=User%3AJuliancolton&#38;year=&#38;month=-1&#38;tagfilter=">September 27, 2008</a>.  In that period of time he has committed over 84,000 edits to the database and 14,000 logged actions, which I believe form a proper record for judging his ability. </p>
<p>In those actions, Julian has created <a href="" title="User:Juliancolton/FAs">20 FAs</a> such as <a href="" title="Typhoon Tip">Typhoon Tip</a> and about 60 <a href="" title="WP:GA">GAs</a> like <a href="" title="Hurricane Bonnie (1998)">Hurricane Bonnie (1998)</a>, which places him among the most accomplished active Wikipedians in these areas.  Additionally, he has closed over 2,000 <a href="" title="WP:AFD">AFDs</a> with a high degree of accuracy.  AFD closing requires administrators to use their judgment to ascertain <a href="" title="WP:CONSENSUS">consensus</a> and he has done a fine job there.  Additionally, he founded the <a href="" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Hudson Valley">Hudson Valley Wikiproject</a> and the <a href="" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Non-tropical storms">Non-tropical Storms Wikiproject</a>.  Further, he is highly active clerking at <a href="" title="WP:CHU">Change username</a> and has nominated several individuals for <a href="" title="WP:RFA">RFA</a>. These efforts show that Julian can balance the workload of creating high quality content with performing administrative work.  They also show he is a well rounded contributor who is in touch with the community and adept at acting properly within policy in tasks he performs.  For these reasons, I put him forward today for <a href="" title="WP:CRAT">bureaucratship</a>.   <b><a href="" title="User:MBisanz">&#60;span style=&#39;color: #FFFF00;background-color: #0000FF;&#39;&#62;MBisanz&#60;/span&#62;</a></b> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:MBisanz">&#60;span style=&#39;color: #FFA500;&#39;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 01:13, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Questions_for_the_candidate">Questions for the candidate</span></h4>
<p>Dear candidate, thank you for offering to serve Wikipedia as a bureaucrat. You may wish to answer the following &#60;u&#62;optional&#60;/u&#62; questions to provide guidance for participants:
</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>1.</b> Have you read the discussions on when to promote and not promote? What do you understand the criteria for promotion to be?
<dl>
<dd><b>A</b>. The primary determining factor is whether or not the community trusts an individual with the extra set of tools. The role of a bureaucrat is to judge the discussion, and establish whether or not a consensus has been reached regarding that issue. I&#39;m not too keen on arbitrary percentage limits, but from what I understand, 70%–80% percent falls within the realm of bureaucrat discretion.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>2.</b> How would you deal with contentious nominations where a decision to promote or not promote might be criticized?
<dl>
<dd><b>A</b>. As with all of the RfAs I would close, I&#39;d read the entire discussion, including the talk page, to try to fully understand the situation. I would then weigh the various arguments produced by the discussion, and if at that time I was unable to establish consensus, I would initiate a bureaucrat discussion. If I were the only bureaucrat qualified to close the RfA, however, I would exercise my best judgment and provide a thorough rationale to explain my decision.</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>3.</b> Wikipedians expect bureaucrats to adhere to high standards of fairness, knowledge of policy and the ability to engage others in the community. Why do you feel you meet those standards?
<dl>
<dd><b>A</b>. I feel I&#39;m generally a reasonable admin and editor who has a strong and comprehensive understanding of policy. I contribute to the project several hundred times per day, and I actively participate in community discussions. As MBisanz noted, I have contributed substantial amounts of quality content to the project in addition to my work with various internal processes (such as <a href="" title="WP:AFD">AFD</a>, <a href="" title="WP:CHU">CHU</a>, etc). I have also been trusted with adminship on three other projects, including Commons. But beyond any content or administrative work that I have done, I believe my most  redeeming qualities are that I always strive to be both honest and fair in my interactions with other editors, and that I readily admit to my mistakes and do my best to learn from them.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p><b>Optional Question from Balloonman</b>
</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>4.</b> Julian, when I first discovered that you were still a minor, it shocked me.  I honestly pictured you as a 40 year old middle manager working for some national weather/ocean watching organization.  Thus, I am not concerned about your personal maturity.  The concern I have, is that over the past six months or so, you have emerged as one of the strongest voices against  &#34;ageism.&#34;  Going so far as to co-support an RfC against the most vocal voice criticizing youthful admins.  In one discussion, you wrote, <i>I fail to see how &#34;oppose because candidate isn&#39;t 18&#34; is any different than &#34;oppose because candidate is black&#34; or &#34;oppose because candidate is white&#34;. They&#39;re the same.</i>  First, do you still stand by that statement?  If so why?  If not, what is wrong with it?  Second, can you alleviate my fear that you will be more likely to promote people who are under the age of 18 because of your public views on &#34;ageism&#34;?---<b><a href="" title="User:Balloonman">&#60;font color=&#34;purple&#34;&#62;Balloonman&#60;/font&#62;</a></b> <i><a href="" title="User talk:Balloonman">&#60;b&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;NO! I&#39;m Spartacus!&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/b&#62;</a></i> 07:13, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Indeed, I am a minor within my jurisdiction, and I am against ageist-type views. That said, my views have matured somewhat regarding the matter since last year, when I compared ageism to racism. I still think discriminating based on age is wrong, but I&#39;ve begun to view the issue in a different light as of late. To answer your other question, I always strive to be both neutral and fair in my administrative (and editorial) decisions. Regardless of whether I &#34;like&#34; the candidate for whatever reason, I assure you I would not let my personal feelings get in the way of judging consensus. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 13:03, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><b>Follow-up</b> Can you elaborate on how you&#39;ve started to view the subject in a different light?---<b><a href="" title="User:Balloonman">&#60;font color=&#34;purple&#34;&#62;Balloonman&#60;/font&#62;</a></b> <i><a href="" title="User talk:Balloonman">&#60;b&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;NO! I&#39;m Spartacus!&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/b&#62;</a></i> 13:54, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, I&#39;ll be perfectly honest here. I suppose that since being promoted to sysop, my views on quite a few matters have evolved, as I&#39;ve read through thousands of discussions and made plenty of difficult judgment calls. I now see that age-based discrimination is justified in many cases, particularly in the real-world. I&#39;ve also come to see that editors who oppose RfAs based on age are acting in good-faith, whereas in early 2008, I often thought the direct opposite. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 14:11, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dt>Additional optional questions from [[User</dt>
<dd>Groomtech|Groomtech]]</dd>
<dd><b>5.</b> Do you believe that Wikipedians have rights? If so, what will you do to uphold them?
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> As I said earlier, I did not really wish to answer this question, so I apologize if my answer is a bit shaky. As you mention on your userpage, there are many different kinds of rights that Wikipedians have. The official Wikipedia policy mentions only two in particular, the right to vanish (for users in good standing) and the eight to fork. However, as a community, we have developed many, many additional standards that have essentially become our noncodified rights (in addition to our <a href="" title="natural rights">natural rights</a> and those given to us by our respective systems of government). There are, quite literally, dozens of such rights, including the <a href="" title="Wikipedia:On privacy, confidentiality and discretion">right to privacy</a>, the right to be treated civilly and respectfully, the right not be defamed or discriminated against, the right edit to Wikipedia &#60;small&#62;for editors in good standing&#60;/small&#62;, the right to fair treatment, etc. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 00:47, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd><b>6.</b> How would you close these RfA?  If you opine for a crat chat, please express what you would have said there as the final determination of the outcome.

<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> Probably <b>no consensus</b>; while supports far outnumbered the opposition, there appeared to be too many concerns. Note that I say this purely from a procedural point of view, as Aervanath has been an excellent admin since his promotion. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 20:51, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>

<dd><b>7.</b> Is a trusted candidate who in your opinion will never misuse tools but has no experience in Deletion having taken in less than 10 <a href="" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFDin</a> over 3 years but wants to use the tools in Deletions of articles and images in <a href="" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a>,<a href="" title="WP:PROD">WP:PROD</a> ,<a href="" title="WP:IFD">WP:IFD</a> is opposed in a RFA for that and it comes into the area of discretion?What would you do ?

<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> It depends. If there was no evidence whatsoever to suggest that the candidate would misuse the tools, and is, aside from low levels of experience in deletion, a productive editor, I would most likely support.

<p><b>Optional Question(s) from <a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b>
</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>8.</b> Some questions about the way you close AfDs. 
<dl>
<dd><b>8a.</b> Some days you close over 50 AfDs--and sometimes that is more than one-half the total. Why do you do such a high proportion?-
<dl>
<dd><b>A</b> I&#39;m not sure how to answer this to be honest. I feel I am well-qualified for closing AfDs, but not by any means more well-qualified than other admins. See, when I arrive at AfD, in most cases the straight-forward discussions have already been closed for obvious reasons, and I take on the more difficult or controversial decisions to suppress the backlog. Thus, I do usually end up closing 1/3 to 1/2 of each day&#39;s AfDs. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 17:46, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>8b.</b> You sometimes close before the 7 days have elapsed, sometimes half a day, such as <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mtigwaki_(2nd_nomination)&#38;action=edit&#38;section=T-1" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mtigwaki_(2nd_nomination)&#38;action=edit&#38;section=T-1"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mtigwaki_" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mtigwaki_">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Mtigwaki_</a>(2nd_nomination)&#38;action=edit&#38;section=T-1</a> , or just a few hours , as <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rob_%22Coach%22_Fulton_(2nd_nomination)&#38;action=edit&#38;section=T-1" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rob_%22Coach%22_Fulton_(2nd_nomination)&#38;action=edit&#38;section=T-1"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rob_%22Coach%22_Fulton_" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rob_%22Coach%22_Fulton_">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion/Rob_%22Coach%22_Fulton_</a>(2nd_nomination)&#38;action=edit&#38;section=T-1</a>  (before the change to 7 days, you were frequently closing at 4 days, not 5,) Why? 
<dl>
<dd><b>A</b> No, I don&#39;t view it as a race at all. I&#39;m not a big fan of process creep, so I&#39;m readily prepared to invoke IAR in order to close certain discussions prematurely. Nonetheless, I nearly always let AfDs run their full 7 days. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 17:46, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>8c.</b> You close them at the average rate of 1 per minute, sometimes 2 per minute. Does that give you enough time to consider?
<dl>
<dd><b>A</b> I frequently check the current AfD log, and read nearly all discussions; when it is time for closing, I&#39;m able to make a decision quickly and efficiently. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 17:46, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>8d.</b> When you close, you almost never give any explanation at all.  Why?
<dl>
<dd><b>A</b> I nearly always provide a rationale to explain my more difficult or contentious decisions, but I often leave out detailed explanations when I feel the discussion has been straightforward. This is because in my experience, long and detailed rationales tend to be divisive and drama-inducing. Even so, I&#39;m more than happy to explain my actions upon request. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 17:46, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>8e.</b> Why do you prefer to close AfDs rather than discuss in them?  
<dl>
<dd><b>A</b> Hard to say. I generally try to remain as neutral as possible whenever I go, so I&#39;m able to assist in resolving disputes or such; obviously I&#39;d be far less neutral participating in an AfD than I would be simply closing it. Furthermore, I generally feel more competition closing AfDs than I do &#34;voting&#34; in them. I do occasionally provide my $0.02, however. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 17:46, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dt>Additional questions from [[User</dt>
<dd>Moni3|Moni3]]</dd>
<dd><b>9.</b> You and I often agree, but every now and then we are ideologically opposed. One of these issues is regarding the limitations of your articles. While I respect that level of detail necessary to comprehend weather and cyclones, all of your articles are storm-related (or road-related, another topic with multiple articles that may follow a formula). I would not ask this of an arbitrator&#39;s nomination, but the bureaucrat issue compels me to bring it up. Why do you not branch out? It suggests that you have such a specialized niche that you are unable or unwilling to expand other types of articles. Not only would it benefit Wikipedia, but it would also be personally beneficial for you to take on something you are interested in yet know very little about. My least concern is that you are taking the path of least resistance and it would be frustrating and difficult to construct articles on new topics. My most skeptical assumption is that it is much easier to collect bronze stars when articles are formulaic and can simply have different information plugged in depending on the storm or road. I wanted to give you an opportunity to explain it.
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> Wikipedia is a volunteer project, which means no-one has an obligation to even edit on any given day. As such, editors should work where they feel comfortable; for me, that is primarily the <a href="" title="WP:WPTC">tropical cyclones WikiProject</a>. I&#39;ve been heavily interested in meteorology for 5 or 6 years now, and I feel quite knowledgeable in that field, so I can make a greater impact on the project by concentrating on weather-related articles than improving other random stuff. Roads came as an interest to me when  , one of <a href="" title="WP:NYSR">WP:NYSR</a>&#39;s most productive members, basically taught me how to edit. That said, I don&#39;t just limit myself to meteorology or highways; I often write on lakes, swamps, villages, and whatever else catches my eye. To be honest, I&#39;m not terribly set on getting the bronze FA stars. I contribute to the featured content process in good-faith because I feel it&#39;s a worthwhile endeavor, and a benefit for Wikipedia.  –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 18:10, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>10.</b> You have stated your opinions on ageism on Wikipedia. I tend to avoid this argument unless confronted with it directly. You will have the ability to perform functions, end discussions, and archive or promote RfAs in which ageism and IRC problems leak into the discussions. I think the calls of discrimination are... what&#39;s a nicer word for bullshit? Nevermind. It&#39;s discrimination to people who have not faced real discrimination in my opinion, and a cycle of fallacy that can only be resolved with time and age. Yet in my experience and background (with a master&#39;s in Gifted Education) I also recognize the extraordinary abilities of some young people. Gifted in one area does not equal gifted in all, and it is common for a student to exhibit extraordinary intellectual behavior while simultaneously exhibiting age-level or below-average emotional behavior. Many adults display fairly shameful behavior as well, so there do not seem to be easy guidelines for this issue. Do you plan to implement your ideas about ageism in bureaucratic functions? If so, how might you do this?
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> In short, no—as started above, I wouldn&#39;t let my personal views get in the way of administrative or bureaucratic actions. </dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>Expansion, upon request: The closing bureaucrat&#39;s job is to evaluate consensus as it had exists at the end of the RfX. At the end of this RfA, the final tally sat at 126/32/5, or 79.7%, which is on the very high end of the traditional discretionary zone. The supports mainly thought that FlyingToaster had improved enough since her previous RfA, while the opposers had concerns either over the content work that FlyingToaster had done or over the possible &#34;IRC supports&#34;. Since FlyingToaster had created over 150 articles (remember, Peter Damian had not yet brought up the plagiarism issues, and so the closing bureaucrat would have been unaware of this), there was fairly strong evidence that FlyingToaster did contribute to the mainspace, and so those opposes would not have been enough for me to close the RfA as no consensus.</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>Expansion, upon request: Well, Riana was obviously an extremely trusted user at the time. &#34;Numerically speaking, [the RfB] fell very slightly above the highest % support for an unsuccessful nomination (85.3% - <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship/Quadell">Quadell</a>) and below the lowest % support for a successful RfB (86.7% - <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for bureaucratship/Andrevan3">Andre</a>)&#34; at the time.<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_bureaucratship/Riana/Bureaucrat_discussion" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_bureaucratship/Riana/Bureaucrat_discussion"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_bureaucratship/Riana/Bureaucrat_discussion" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_bureaucratship/Riana/Bureaucrat_discussion">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_bureaucratship/Riana/Bureaucrat_discussion</a></a> The opposition mainly centered on two issues: Riana&#39;s nomination of Kelly Martin for adminship (which ended disasterously) and issues of incivility. I agree with what <a href="" title="User:Warofdreams">Warofdreams</a> said at the &#39;cratchat: &#34;I do not, however, believe that &#39;no significant opposition&#39; has been a rule of thumb, and indeed it is almost impossible to achieve in a discussion involving so many users. In this case, the opposition clearly is significant; the question is whether it is sufficient that this should be closed as no consensus. In summary, this is within the range commonly given particularly close consideration. In my view, a small number of issues have been raised, have been fully considered, and there are nonetheless a large majority in favour of Riana becoming a bureaucrat. It&#39;s a finely balanced one, but I would call it as just sufficient to constitute a consensus.&#34;</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd><b>12.</b> What is your philosophy on what votes and rationales (oppose or otherwise) may be disregarded, or afforded less weight, and how will you apply this?
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> No good-faith votes should be completely disregarded in my opinion, as nearly everyone is welcome to voice their opinion at RfA. However, a key part of determining consensus is judging which opinions hold more weight. <i>In general</i>, arguments supported by policy should be given generous weight, but obviously there are exceptions. It depends on the situation, really. Apologies for this answer being sort of dull, but I can&#39;t think of much else to add at the moment. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 18:26, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There are <i>no</i> specific examples of good-faith votes you would discount? You can think of none? Especially given the recent discussions on WT:RFA, of which I note you have been a not insignificant participant. And to which policies must votes be related to be given weight? What are some of the exceptions? <i>÷<a href="" title="user:seresin">seresin</a></i> 18:45, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Sorry, I should have been clearer. There are many good-faith votes to which I would assign very little weight, but none that I would disregard without even considering, as that goes against the spirit of consensus in my opinion. </dd>
<dd>On the other hand, votes supported by any number of conduct policies and specific examples of inappropriate behavior receive extra weight; opposes with little to no evidence, unless the reason for which is extremely obvious, often contribute little to the discussion. If you asked me about specific examples of votes, I would be able to explain in greater detail. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 18:46, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I hate to be a bother, but you&#39;re not actually saying anything. <i>There are many good-faith votes to which I would assign very little weight, but none that I would disregard without even considering</i>. You seem to have drawn a distinction between &#34;discount&#34; and &#34;assign little weight&#34;; since I only used the former word I see why you chose to only specify there. So if I could trouble you again: to which votes and rationales would you assign less weight, or even &#34;very little weight&#34;? The only reason we have bureaucrats instead of bots in charge of promoting is so that we can have someone qualify rather than quantify the votes and reasons. I want to know how you plan to qualify oppose votes. <i>÷<a href="" title="user:seresin">seresin</a></i> 23:33, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, everything as far as qualifying opposition votes generally goes case-by-case. If the communtiy had previously expressed serious concerns about a particular type of vote and that vote was not backed up by policy (DougsTech, Kurt Weber), those votes would be discounted. Several other types of votes I would assign little weight: oppose votes demanding quite ridiculous standards (eg. 2 years of experience, 20,000 edits) that have been deemed inappropriate by the community; votes focusing on where a particular candidate stands on certain internal political debates; opposes with no rationale; and votes that came as a direct result of canvassing. Hopefully this is a more adequate response, but feel free to request further clarfication. Again, I must say that it is more of knowing it when you see it, so particular examples as to what in particular you wish to hear my opinion of about would be good. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 01:11, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dt><b>Optional Question from Jarry1250</b> </dt>
<dd><b>13.</b> Do you think that your two own unsuccessful RfAs - or your &#34;landslide&#34; third request - will affect how you close other people&#39;s requests for adminship? If so, how?
<dl>
<dd>Not necessarily. My first two RfAs (which both closed within a day) showed me that failing an RfA is usually a stressful and disappointing situation, but the closing bureaucrat can&#39;t help that. Again, I don&#39;t think it&#39;ll affect how I close other RfAs. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 18:34, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd><b>15.</b> How old are you? (I&#39;m 53, and I don&#39;t consider myself ageist. However, if you are 14, I&#39;m concerned; if you are 17 and nearly 18, I&#39;m less concerned. It&#39;s not a deal-breaker, but you&#39;re putting yourself forward for election to a highly responsible position at the world&#39;s most significant information site, and it&#39;s unusual for a minor to do so. At issue are breadth of emotional experience, maturity, and in legal terms, the likelihood of exposure to the nastier elements of WP. Please don&#39;t take offence.) 
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> The Internet is a very unsafe place, so I prefer not to disclose my exact age; however, I will say that I am between the ages of 14 and 18. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 16:12, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd><b>16.</b> To what extent would you discount supports or opposes based on (i) a candidate&#39;s writing ability, (ii) the extent and breadth of a candidate&#39;s content editing, and (iii) claimed insufficient knowledge of some policies (e.g., <a href="" title="WP:NFC">WP:NFC</a>)? The obverse of these questions are (i) what <i>kind</i> of writing ability does an admin need to perform their duties well? (ii) Is it important for an admin to have had a moderate amount of experience at content editing? and (iii) Does an admin need good knowledge of <i>all</i> of the major policies? In each case: why or why not?
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> All of these are valid concerns, and should not be completely disregarded. In my opinion, admins should have the ability to write reasonably well, both in the mainspace and within discussions; content building and effective communication are key. In terms of content contributions, while I like RfA candidates to have at least some recognized work under their belt, it really comes down to trust. If the community has shown through consensus that it trusts a candidate with little in the way of content creation, the result would be to promote. As for the final questions, yes, I believe admins should be <i>familiar</i> with all major policies. I don&#39;t expect admins to be able to recite each policy word-for-word, but they should be able to understand the rules they&#39;re enforcing. Thus, opposes based on lack of knowledge of policy should be given significant weight. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 16:12, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd><b>17:</b> Can you please explain the IRC incident mentioned in the oppose and neutral sections? While Jennavecia has already given an explanation, and not that I don&#39;t trust her, it would be best if you could provide an explanation to clarify what right now looks like a series of misunderstandings by multiple users. 
<dl>
<dd><b>A:</b> I think Jennavecia is correct for the most part. My IRC connection was shaky, and as a result my client repeatedly and automatically re-joined, thus flooding my personal channel. Not knowing it was me, I suggested it might have been another person, who had been disruptive in the same channel earlier that day. A few other users perceived it as a malicious attempt on my part to get said person banned from the channel, but indeed, it was little more than a misunderstanding. Hopefully this makes sense to non-IRC gurus. –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 23:50, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dt><b>Optional Question from [[User</b></dt>
<dd>MLauba|MLauba]]</dd>
<dd><b>18:</b>How do you see the admin role within Wikipedia?
<dl>
<dd>Admins should be role models for other editors, and should follow nearly all policies, conduct or otherwise, whenever possible. They should be friendly and willing to help, and they should use their tools to the benefit of the encyclopedia. They should be able to resolve disputes calmly and professionally, and should have broad experience with the project. They should understand Wikipedia&#39;s goals, and work to meet them.

<dd>Theres a flip side to that Killer,  which is the negative attacks on candidates has likely  been having the affect of making some afraid to put themselves up for promotion in the first place.  Questioning oppose opinions can result in a discussion which addresses all concerns,  setting  opposers minds at rest,  leading to them change their vote.    Surely most of good faith would welcome such discussion at it clearly improves the quality of our overall decision making? Granted  those opposing on false pretences will likely be hostile to questioning,  but surely we dont have to change our processes to pander to folk who oppose due to politics, grudges, or simply as they get off on  putting folk down?  If theyre  not up for a little discussion,  they dont need to  step up.   </dd>
<dd>Also Julians a cool guy,  no way will he hold a grudge against someone whos  opposed!</dd>
<dd>PS.  Sorry if this sounds unsympathetic,  from what little Ive seen youre a very protective puppy and ive no doubt youre motivated by good faith,  i just dont think we can let  opposers have a free hand while restricting supporters.

<dd>The whole point of the Rfb is that we promote people we trust to be able to judge. Taht&#39;s why its &#34;not a vote&#34; - because the &#39;crats can weight arguments. Support, he&#39;s trustworthy +1. Oppose, I don&#39;t like his userpage 0. Oppose, he is rude (dif, dif, dif) -1. It is <b>not</b> so that the oppose&#39;s can be badgered and harassed by an over-eager campaigner. Your suggestion that the person who emailed me, who specifically said <i>&#34;...fear of potential retribution within this kind of interpersonal environment...&#34;</i> get &#34;tough&#34; is not helpful, IMO. It is up to Julian to not be so aggressive that he intimidates editors so much he scares them away from voicing their concerns.

<li><b>Strong Support</b> There are two or three users that helped ease me into the Wikipedia community and JC is the one that deserves the most credit. Being somewhat local and editing many of the same pages, he supported me in many of my endeavors, including (successfully) nominating me for adminship. I owe him a lot and much of my work here can stem back to his graceful patience with me as a bit of an unofficial adopter in my early days; even today, he&#39;s always there to immediately answer a question for me on IRC. That speaks to his character, but his contributions speak to his efforts and skills here as what I would legitimately call the <b>paragon of sysops</b> on the English Wikipedia; he edits at a level that all sysops and editors should strive for, consistently keeps a cool and level head, and offers clear and clever insight into any issue he is involved in. &#34;Net positive&#34; isn&#39;t even an argument here because I know for a fact that he will be one of the most successful bureaucrats this project has ever seen.

<li><b>Strong Support</b> I have worked with Julian in multiple areas: When I was a new editor, he helped encourage me, and guide me in policy and guidelines to be followed, as well as what was considered common sense.  In matter related to BLP issues, he continues to help me on a regular basis.  As a new admin, he has given me valuable advice and assistance.  I&#39;m not quite sure how he does it, but he always manages to find time to help with even the most trivial matters.  He appears exceptional in his ability to gauge consensus, and I believe he would make a positive addition to the community in fulfilling that role. — &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #000000;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;&#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:Ched Davis">Ched</a>&#60;/b&#62; : <a href="" title="User_talk:Ched Davis">&#60;font style=&#34;color:#FFFFFF;background:#0000fa;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;?&#38;nbsp;&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 05:10, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Julian is a fine editor who constantly strives to improve the encyclopedia. I have not always agreed with him, and it is likely that I will disagree with him multiple times in the future.

<li><b>Support</b> There is a reason I had preemptively watchlisted this RFB and I&#39;m glad to see Julian finally went for it. A great contributor who has time and time again shown that he is one of the most clueful, patient and helpful admins on this project, whose insight and impartiality should be an example to us all (they are to me). I might not agree with everything he says or does but I can always be sure that he will not let his personal opinions interfere with his tasks as an admin. Julian has the necessary knowledge in most of the crat areas, is an active clerk at <a href="" title="WP:CHU">WP:CHU</a> and an active contributor to <a href="" title="WP:RFA">WP:RFA</a> and I am more than convinced that he will do an impressive job as a crat.

<li><b>Support</b> As one of the people who helped Julian find his footing on wikipedia, I have had great pleasure in watching Julian grow from strength to strength as an editor. The experience he has on wikipedia is clearly indicated by his success at being able to balance admin tasks and content editting. 20FA&#39;s is a great achievement by anyones standards and he activity at AFD is also exceptional. He is one of the most exemplary admins we have and the most important thing is that I do not believe that giving him the extra bits will affect the positive contributions to the project that he gives. He has an extensive experience of consensus discussions and I raise a point that judging consensus is more than just counting !votes and is more about looking at the merits of the discussion.

He knows which supports are strong and which opposes are meaningful. I can definitely trust in him to be a Crat that would discount things that are &#34;votes&#34; in their truest sense - obvious and blatant canvassing, off topic statements without any real weight, biased supports that are done merely to counteract some oppose or votes done out of spite or revenge. <a href="" title="User:Ottava Rima">Ottava Rima</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ottava Rima">talk</a>) 14:07, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Weak Support</b> per answers to my questions. Just to clarify, I was prepared to oppose JC because of his comparisons of ageism to racism. I think the comparison is abhorrent, but the comment was made about a year ago and I&#39;m going to give him the benefit of the doubt that he has matured in this regard. I would, however, advise him to refrain from promoting candidates who are known to be minors (at least at first.) His advocacy on the subject of ageism does raise some concerns, but again not enough to push me into the oppose camp.---<b><a href="" title="User:Balloonman">&#60;font color=&#34;purple&#34;&#62;Balloonman&#60;/font&#62;</a></b> <i><a href="" title="User talk:Balloonman">&#60;b&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;NO!

<dd>My two cents is that sometimes the best description of what&#39;s not working in a given situation is that someone is acting too young, and if you&#39;re sufficiently gentle, then it&#39;s not a sin to say that; it would be abhorrent to say they&#39;re acting too black.  I interpret comments I&#39;ve seen (this year) from JC as an attempt to be supportive of younger editors who were either getting beat up or feeling that way; that interpretation is the one that is in line with everything else I&#39;ve seen Julian say, not the interpretation that he&#39;s got a manifesto about a new social order where kids are in charge that he&#39;d like to push; that doesn&#39;t sound like JC at all to me. - Dank (<a href="" title="User talk:Dank">push to talk</a>) 15:29, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></li>

<li>Per Balloonman&#39;s comments in Q4, and Julian&#39;s answer. Julian almost always shows great judgment, he&#39;s active in several areas, and from a review of his AFD work, he seems to judge consensus there in a well thought out way.  Even where I disagree, I can understand and accept his rationale. Consistently knows exactly what he&#39;s doing and what needs done.  However, I was concerned that as a &#39;crat, he would discount good-faith opposes based on what he considers &#34;ageism&#34;. His answer to Q4 convinces me that, even in cases where he disagrees, he now sees such opposes as legitimate opinions.  Therefore, I am happy to support. --<a href="" title="User:Floquenbeam">Floquenbeam</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Floquenbeam">talk</a>) 15:33, 7 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b>  I actually like how the <a href="" title="WP:Ageism">WP:Ageism</a> thing played out. Many people think the way he did around that age, and I find that young people who express their opinions strongly about it the way he did usually are pretty bright. They tend to get frustrated because they know they are smart and can&#39;t understand why their age should matter. Then, as they grow up a little, they start to realize that no matter how smart you are, there&#39;s no substitute for experience. I think he&#39;s at the point where this realization is taking place, and I think he&#39;s smart enough to know when he might need input from others. It seems to me that Juliancolton is nothing more than a precocious young person who tries to do the right thing, almost always does, and is able to recognize when he might be making a mistake. He&#39;s also simply one of those people around here that I&#39;ve always had a good feeling about.

<li><b>Support</b> As per many of the reasons cited above. My own interactions with Julian have always been helpful and civil and I think he would continue doing a fine job. On the issue of age I tend to follow a quote from one of my favorite authors <a href="" title="Robert A. Heinlein">Robert A. Heinlein</a>.

<li><b>Support</b> – I&#39;m late to the party, but I&#39;d like to join the supporting crowd. Julian is diligent and active in the right areas, has a good sense of what he&#39;s doing and what he seeks to achieve, and certainly appears to have the necessary impetus to fill the position. I just hope he doesn&#39;t burn out; as the candidate himself notes, he edits several hundred times a day, which must be (in a virtual sense) exhausting.

<li><b>Support</b> I have seen a lot of Juliancolton&#39;s work at closing AfDs as well as the occasional comment in them and his work there is pretty much irreproachable.  There have even been a couple of times when a close-call closure was against my strong opinion but his comments convinced me that he made the correct decision.  I am sure he has made errors  but I haven&#39;t seen them.  Age is indeed an issue and unfortunately that is something no one understands until they are no longer young but that is much outweighed by the repeaatedly-demonstrated fact that this is a person we can trust to make correct decisions.  In some decisions, being young is a benefit but unfortunately that is something few understand when they are old. Closing RfAs is very important work and I trust him to do it properly. <a href="" title="User:Drawn Some">Drawn Some</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Drawn Some">talk</a>) 00:16, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support.</b> All of my interactions with this user have been extremely positive, and I&#39;ve seen Julian do good work throughout Wikipedia, in many different locations. The main reason for opposition seems to be about the candidate&#39;s age and their ability to explain themselves, but I don&#39;t have any major concerns about that. While it is certainly true that younger admins/crats are more likely to make poor decisions, this is only a generalization. If someone, no matter how young, proves to be an intelligent and mature user, I think we can trust them with the tools.

<li><b>Support</b> (switched from oppose). My own reasons for opposing were hardly quantifiable, and I&#39;m not swayed by maturity concerns that have been put forth. Since I can&#39;t support the rest of the opposers, I&#39;m giving Julian the benefit of the doubt. At the very least, I figure he can grow and will admit mistakes. --&#60;font color=&#34;#cc6600&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:David Fuchs">Der Wohltemperierte Fuchs</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; &#60;nowiki&#62;(&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;small&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#993300&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;nowiki&#62;)&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 01:16, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b>. Absolutely.

<li><b>Support</b> - Obviously he knows what he&#39;s doing in technical terms, he has an admirable record of content creation and seems a moderate, thoughtful young chap. A careful review of his performance as an editor and an administrator puts the spear through suggestions that his age renders him unsuitable for promotion. His unwillingness to answer Q5 indicates to me that he is a little more cautious than I might like, but I doubt that will be an impediment to his performing the role of a bureaucrat, which seems a rather mundane task to me. <a href="" title="User:Craftyminion">Crafty</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Craftyminion">talk</a>) 03:04, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> Have encountered him from time in article areas (not RfDs etc, where I haven&#39;t tended to participate), and has seemed diligent and level-headed. Based on what I have read here today, I would encourage him to write a little more in closing summaries etc - I&#39;m guessing this is something likely to be (even?) more important as a &#39;crat than it has been in the admin role.

<li><b>Support</b> – It seems that the brunt of this RFB regards JC&#39;s AFD closures. Wrt to Q8a, if the desire is to let other admins close AFDs to get a more representative sampling from the admin community on XFDs, then that&#39;s a very weak reason to oppose at most. Admins and crats must judge whether or not consensus for deletion in XFDs (or adminship for RFAs or flagging bots for BRFAs) and should refrain from adding any notes in closures that gives them the impression that their closures were more indicative of an !vote (which, IMHO, was what MBisanz looked at, and why he nominated JC for this RFB). Finally, although process is important, IAR ensures that we&#39;re not dwelling on clear cases, allowing us to move on to other ventures and pressing issues on the encyclopedia.

But I <i>like</i> Juliancolton. He&#39;s a genuinely good-humoured and collegial editor and a pleasure to interact with.

<li><b>Support</b> I only wish that half the editors here were as mature as Juliancolton. (Count me among those who pictured him as in his 40s. Just goes to show that there are some very mature teens, and some very immature adults in this world.) He&#39;s clueful, has a brain, communicates well, and is always open to discussion. He has the best interests of the encyclopedia at heart.

<li><b>long winded support</b>I should be !voting in the oppose section because (a) he&#39;s too young (b) he closes too many Afds or (c) he needs more experience - all of which I kinda sorta agree with. But (a) I&#39;m amazed, flabbergasted, shocked, dazed, that he&#39;s so young! He&#39;s not exactly invisible and if he&#39;s a drunk pretending to be sober he&#39;s definitely doing an excellent job - clearly they don&#39;t make youth the same way as they did when I was 14-18! Also, if maturity comes with age (and I do believe it does, or at least one learns not to take oneself overly seriously), then he can only get more mature from here on and we&#39;ll have a mature bureaucrat who&#39;ll only get better - what&#39;s wrong with that? (b) I think juliancolton is a serious young man trying to responsibly make his way in the world and efficiently clearing admin tasks is one of these responsibilities that he&#39;s fulfilling. With time, he&#39;ll learn that discretion is the better part of valor, but, in the meantime, I think the analogy between RfAs and AfDs is a tad stretched (a slight difference in number and backlogs!). At worst, a couple more RfA closes than normal - though, after this RfB, even that&#39;s unlikely - before other bureaucrats start begging for a chance to close an RfB. (c) He does need more experience and this is probably the one thing that would give me pause except that I see no harm in his gaining the experience as a bureaucrat. The worst case scenario that I can see is that he&#39;ll err once or twice on the side of seeing a consensus to promote in an RfA where its not totally clear and not only is that the worst case it&#39;s also not totally a bad thing. Overall, I see him as a stayer - someone who will stay with the project and is not climbing the rungs because they&#39;re there, as an overall asset to the project that we should be loathe to lose, as a young person who will grow into the role, and as a responsible editor who says what he means. All in all I&#39;d rather err on the side of making him a bureaucrat a wee bit early rather than risk losing him and so I fall solidly in the support column. --<a href="" title="User:RegentsPark">RegentsPark</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:RegentsPark">sticks and stones</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 03:23, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

I have never thought of him as being immature, and nor have I seen him being so (as far as my shoddy memory can remember). I fail to see how age comes into such a matter as this when all this position infers is an extension of the tools he already has -- he has clearly demonstrated a use for the bureaucrat bit, and has not let the community down through his use of his current extended set of tools. Julian is a huge positive input to this project, and I believe that giving him the &#39;crat tools would merely allow him to excercise this positive input on a wider scale.

<dd>I think part of what Polargeo might be taking issue with is your suggestion that you see a lot of &#34;bullshit and hypocrisy&#34; in the oppose section. Even if that&#39;s how you feel, and even if it&#39;s true, it&#39;s utterly non-helpful to point that out here. Of course it&#39;s fine to think those opposing are making bad arguments, but I think most of the !votes in that section are in good faith and reasonably thoughtful. For what it&#39;s worth, I think one of the reasons that many editors (including myself) avoid participation in RfAs is because they frequently devolve into pissing contests between opposers and supporters. Since I&#39;m opposing this RfB, I disagree with those supporting for the most part, but at the same time I completely respect your views and those of everyone else in the support camp. I think it&#39;s possible to discuss and disagree here without being disrespectful, and I don&#39;t think your comment is helpful in that regard. --<a href="" title="User:Bigtimepeace">Bigtimepeace</a> &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User_talk:Bigtimepeace">talk</a> |  <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Bigtimepeace">contribs</a>&#60;/small&#62; 07:11, 11 July 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Support</b> Considering his contributions and overall record there is no reason to oppose. I don&#39;t care if he  were 10 (which he&#39;s not), as his judgement is good and he&#39;s a net positive to the encyclopaedia. His answers to queries are well thought out and well worded. I am sure he will take on board any criticisms raised that are actually <i>valid</i>, and overall I believe he&#39;d be an excellent crat. My only concern is he would do less admin and editor work, but otherwise he&#39;s a safe bet. <a href="" title="User:Nja247">&#60;em style=&#34;font-family:Trebuchet MS;color:#6600CC&#34;&#62;<b><i>Nja</i></b>&#60;/em&#62;</a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Nja247">&#60;em style=&#34;font-family:Trebuchet MS;color:#63D1F4&#34;&#62;<b><i>247</i></b>&#60;/em&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 09:27, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Support</b> Over several years as editor and admin I have seen Julian working on many, many occasions, and have been consistently impressed by his judgement. I did not know his age; it did not and does not seen relevant.

<dd>Given that this RfB is ending in just a few hours and that it looks like this RfB will not promote Julian to a &#39;crat, do you really feel the need to make posts like this, Off2riorob?

<dd>I can assure you there is no kicking at all. Although it isn&#39;t much practiced, if we oppose, then we also have a responsibility to question the supports. As for the closure the percentage is currently at 77.5% so lets not prejudge the closure yet. As it has recently been brought to my attention that all support votes are counted, I feel that by not questioning the weak ones that is allowing them all to be blindly accepted when some of them are relativly and assuming good faith, of little value.

<dd>Just to clarify; I have never met him in person, I was asking for him to close a deletion discussion that was withdrawn, and had not been acted on.  I am supporting him because he helped me learn Wikipedia when I was a n00b, not that long ago, and that is the main reason.  I am also a minor, and think that the <a href="" title="WP:Ageist">WP:Ageist</a> opinion is not justified if the editor has proven that they know a large amount about a subject, and most importantly cite sources.  I knew that it was an issue in the discoussion, and hoped that a perfectly capable editor wouldn&#39;t be denied a leadership role, solely because of age.  Here in the US, we have just elected Barack Obama, one of the youngest Presidents in history.  Age is really no reason to keep someone from doing something.

<li><b>Support</b> I&#39;ve worked with and observed him for some time and have never been concerned. I find many of the opposes, particularly those of Peter Damian and Prodego to be little more than tendentious personal ax grinding. The age crap is particularly mind numbing as well.

Julian works diligently to make Wikipedia better, and he does so in a communicative and even handed manner. That&#39;s all that matters.

<li><b>Support</b> - I&#39;ve put a great deal of thought into my vote, read all of the oppose section, including participating in some of it, and really considered Julian overall. I&#39;ve gotten to know Julian pretty well and I&#39;m impressed with his editing and his judgment. He keeps a cool head in heated situations and he&#39;s able to look at the big picture when others often are not. He has a firm grasp on policy and experience in the &#39;crat areas. He&#39;s always willing to help and I trust his word. I believe that because of his personality and his desire to please people, gain and hold their trust, and be respected, if there were any issues to arise from his use of the &#39;crat tools, he would make the necessary moves to improve upon the situation. I believe, from private conversations with Julian, that he takes criticisms to heart and is genuinely desirous of addressing valid concerns, proving opposers wrong through good action, and making his supporters proud. He has always been respectful and courteous in all my interactions with him, and I believe he would make a wonderful &#39;crat. <a href="" title="User:Jennavecia">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Lucida Handwriting;color:#9B30FF&#34;&#62;<b>ل</b>enna&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Jennavecia">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Lucida Handwriting;color:#63B8FF&#34;&#62;vecia&#60;/span&#62;</a> 16:58, 13 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b>. His tendency to close no-consensus AfDs as <i>Delete</i> when he feels the article doesn&#39;t deserve to be kept doesn&#39;t instill much confidence in me.

<dd>Another, more recent example can be found <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Charlie the Unicorn (2nd nomination)">here</a>, where presumably Julian saw the lack of consensus as an invitation to cast his own, deciding !vote as the closing admin. To clarify, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s any ill intent on his side. I&#39;m sure the <i>Delete</i> arguments <i>did</i> sound more convincing to him. Arguments tend to sound more convincing when one is already predisposed to agree with that side.

<dd>I see these examples of JC&#39;s strengths. The three cited AfDs are extremely close calls and the delete arguments <i>do indeed</i> outweigh the supports. That said, you cite two places where another editor questions the closure. How can one complain about a response like, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOwenX&#38;diff=285267104&#38;oldid=280583361" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AOwenX&#38;diff=285267104&#38;oldid=280583361">&#34;Perhaps it would be best to initiate a discussion at DRV, so we can get some outside opinions&#34;</a>? (one of your cited links); it&#39;s <i>precisely</i> the response he should have given. Additionally, I think <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Juliancolton/Archive_13#Please_reconsider_your_closure_of_Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion.2FExaile" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_talk:Juliancolton/Archive_13#Please_reconsider_your_closure_of_Wikipedia:Articles_for_deletion.2FExaile">this</a> shows that JC is only human, and will fix his mistakes when made aware of them.

<li><b>Strong oppose</b>.  On grounds of #1 above, but let me talk about this.  Drunk people <a class="externallink" href="http://www.actingatwork.com/journal/?p=6" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.actingatwork.com/journal/?p=6">famously</a> try not to act drunk, they try to act sober.  They concentrate on acting as soberly as they can: speaking precisely, not stumbling, not swaying, putting their full attention into not appearing drunk.  Similarly young people try not to act young, and try to appear old.  They are particularly obsessed with concepts like &#39;maturity&#39; - when I look at any of these RfA&#39;s and people comment on how &#39;mature&#39; someone is or judge people by their &#39;maturity&#39; I recognise straight away the people concerned are probably under 21, at least.   (Note the word &#39;mature&#39; has already been used in the discussion above <i>9 times</i>).  I didn&#39;t know how old Julian was until today, but he always struck me by his trying-to-appear-mature manner, which I find irritating.  Sometimes people need to act in an &#39;immature&#39; way, or rather, to express their opinions in a strong and forceful way, possibly to cause offence, if that is necessary.  True maturity is about expressing yourself in whatever way is necessary and efective to produce the outcome that is <i>right</i>.  People who are always <i>trying</i> to appear mature (in the form that they imagine maturity takes), will not be effective in producing such an outcome.  So, very sorry, but I must oppose.

<dd><b>Further reason for oppose</b>.  Once again, we are seeing a candidate with claims to good and featured articles, so it is time to look at some of these articles.  Colton claims <a href="" title="User:Juliancolton/FAs">here</a> to have significantly contributed to a number of featured articles of which, one - <a href="" title="Meteorological_history_of_Tropical_Storm_Allison">Meteorological_history_of_Tropical_Storm_Allison</a> - he claims to have &#39;written from scratch&#39;.  Let&#39;s have a look.  The first thing that strikes you is the odd style. I challenge anyone to read it all the way through.  It is painfully dull: it reads exactly like a weather report.  Which is because it is in fact a weather report - see <a class="externallink" href="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2001allison.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/2001allison.html">here</a>.  Please note, this is not plagiarism on the scale of the FlyingToaster RfA.  The wording of each of the copied sentences has been changed so that the end result is not identical.  But the basic structure and style is the same.  For example, Colton&#39;s version reads &#34;The low-level circulation dissipated, though the mid-level circulation persisted. &#34;, whereas the original reads &#34;The low-level circulation weakened ... whereas the strong mid-level circulation remained intact&#34;.  But you have to ask what this is doing in an <i>encyclopedia</i> where our duty is to summarise information in a way appropriate to an encyclopedia, rather than a weather report.  <a href="" title="User:Peter Damian">Peter Damian</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Peter Damian">talk</a>) 14:02, 7 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I do not see how that article is plagiarism <b>at all</b>, nor do I see how it is inappropriate for an encyclopedia. The latter seems to be merely a matter of opinion, so I won&#39;t argue that. The accusation of plagiarism is another matter. </dd>
<dd>With regard to the article&#39;s structure, I would be interested to see your suggestions on a different structure for the article. Some topics do not lend themselves to a wide variety of organizational strategies. A tropical cyclone has a definitive start, end, and various notable events in between. There is no even remotely logical structure for the article other than the one that the source (and Julian) used. </dd>
<dd>With regard to his writing style, this particular storm did not have a tremendous impact compared to some storms. As a result, Julian was forced to rely mostly on National Weather Service reports to write the article. While this fact obviously influenced his style, he did not plagiarize his sources.

Julian did neither of these. He read through the sources and included what he thought was useful <b>using his own words and including inline citations</b>.

All Colton has done is to take a very dull weather report, filter out some of the detail, then replace some of the words with near synonyms.  An easy way to get an article (though why something so dull and useless got near an FA is beyond me). Repeat 50-10 times over and then a bunch of clapping seals such as we find here will vote him in.  That was what I objected to in the FT affair.  Simpy copying stuff with the logical structure intact, without even thinking about thread, structure, relevance, context and all that.

<dd>I have a question, Peter, if you really care about this (and how dull the article is) - also I am not a particular fan of this article because Allison&#39;s destruction is more notable than its lifetime - go complain somewhere like on <a href="" title="WT:WPTC">the Wikipedia WikiProject Tropical Cyclones talk page</a> and such. I don&#39;t think this is the right venue. Also, as of recent, I have been telling another user, who doesn&#39;t have the strength Julian does, that copying from the Tropical Cyclone Report - your second link, is totally plagarism. I actually did the same thing in the early stages of 2006 in <a href="" title="Hurricane Erika (1997)">Hurricane Erika (1997)</a> now a Featured Article written by someone else, and well, I heard about it. I do be plagarism is a problem, but if you read the article, sounding like and being the same are two different things. If it was word-by-word, then I would think plagarism applies to this article. I would just like to know if we could switch venues for this discussion?

<dd>I&#39;ve had a week to consider this candidacy and feel I should expand my rationale a little. When I cast a vote in RfXs I weigh up what I&#39;ve seen of the user, their suitability to the role applied for and the positives and negatives the community has brought up. My impression of Julian is not an unfavourable one, but I have a niggling doubt that stops me offering my support. Some of the rationales of the users in the opposing camp have made persuasive arguments in regards to closing AfDs and I am in agreement with them; I feel that this trait could carry over into cratship. In a bureaucrat, I like to see that the candidate has a good sense of insight, fairness and thoughtfulness and I&#39;m not sure I see all three of these attributes in Julian. Whilst Julian has many good qualities, I&#39;m unsure if his skill set will transfer to bureaucrat. <a href="" title="User:Seraphim">&#60;font color=&#34;CC0033&#34;&#62;Seraphim&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User_talk:Seraphim">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;&#38;hearts;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 00:01, 14 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>&#60;s&#62;While I appreciate Julian&#39;s work as an editor and admin, I&#39;m not sure if his perception of consensus agrees with mine (which I feel is true to the letter/spirit of the law, but which I&#39;m sure he and others would disagree if we had a roundabout talk, but that&#39;s something for another venue and time :P) While RfAs are rarely the sort of difficult close that AfDs are, I&#39;m just not comfortable enough. This is more a &#34;gut feeling&#34; statement then I would like, but *shrug* there it is. --&#60;font color=&#34;#cc6600&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:David Fuchs">Der Wohltemperierte Fuchs</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; &#60;nowiki&#62;(&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;small&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#993300&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:David Fuchs">talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;nowiki&#62;)&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 14:58, 7 July 2009 (UTC)&#60;/s&#62; see above section, --01:13, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li>

<li><b>Strong Oppose</b>.  I agree with Friday.  Julian strikes me as an extremely intelligent and precocious teenager who is, nonetheless, a very young teenager.  I&#39;m concerned, for example, by the answer to question 11.  It seems to me that the word <i>explain</i> is italicized for a reason.  &#34;This may be a bit of a controversial answer, but after reading through much of the discussion, it seems there is a fairly clear consensus to promote&#34; is absolute garbage as an <i>explanation</i>.  Reconcile why there&#39;s controversy if there is fairly clear consensus.  It&#39;s not about being <i>right</i> or <i>wrong</i>.  One of the most important skills of a bureaucrat is the ability to explain the tough calls.  The reason WJBScribe was a great bureaucrat is because he could provide sensible explanations of his thought process.  I sense none of that here. --<a href="" title="User:JayHenry">JayHenry</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:JayHenry">talk</a>) 21:47, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Changed to strong oppose.  The candidate did not understand my point at all, which is only part one of why I&#39;m making the somewhat symbolic shift to strong oppose.  More importantly, I had not seen the RFC against Friday.  How can anyone in good conscience support a bureaucrat candidate who in the past week has endorsed a frivolous and misleading RFC primarily because of disagreement with the victim&#39;s RFA ideology?

<dd>You&#39;re talking about two different categories. There are things that are disruptive enough that I&#39;d address them directly and immediately. Then there are things that are relatively minor in the grand scheme of Wikipedia, but make me uncomfortable in the context of being granted an extremely high level of access - one which is basically irrevocable. Julian&#39;s contributions to that thread fall into the second category for me, not the first, which is why I haven&#39;t brought them up before now. I <i>did</i> look at some of Julian&#39;s responses to similar questions of ageism/maturity, in particular Moni3&#39;s, which I thought were particularly eloquent formulations of the issue. I was impressed with Julian&#39;s composure, but not particularly reassured by the content of his answers.

By default, AfDs close to keep, and I&#39;m not liking the fact that you look the other way. &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:X!">&#60;span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;&#62;X!&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;·&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:X!">&#60;span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>) &#38;nbsp;·&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="Swatch Internet Time">@103</a> &#38;nbsp;·&#38;nbsp;&#60;/small&#62; 01:28, 8 July 2009 (UTC)&#60;/s&#62;

<dd>Not being on IRC, I have no idea what - if anything - is so egregious about Mr. Colton&#39;s behavior therein to warrant these whispers of improper behavior. In your case, Majorly, another editor called attention to the existence of the Wikipedia Review comments, which was easy to review since the contents of that web site, unlike IRC, are open to the general public to ponder. In this case, unlike yours, no links are being provided to back up the problems that two of our editors insist to be troublesome. There are only hints of impropriety and no black-and-white presentations. Since Mr. Colton has given permission to his detractors to express themselves at greater depth, I suggest that we listen to what they have to say and judge this situation based on their input. <a href="" title="User:Pastor Theo">Pastor Theo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Pastor Theo">talk</a>) 02:44, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Okay, so I just asked Julian, because it&#39;s sort of ridiculous that it&#39;s been presented as it has been, to let others guess at what may be the issue. Understandable, however, considering what the &#34;issue&#34; is, as people could not possibly assume it was something of less consequence than it really is. Julian&#39;s connection to IRC was breaking up considerably causing him to be disconnected. Having auto-reconnect and auto-join set for his own channel, he was flooding his channel with leaves and joins. IRC users know what I&#39;m talking about. Julian considered the possibility that a particularly disruptive editor may be causing this and expressed this. Prodego assumed Julian was being malicious in an attempt to get this user, who is currently banned from the channel for unrelated disruptions, banned. Now, let me clarify the most important point in this entire situation. The channel in question is Julian&#39;s own channel. So, if he wanted someone banned, he could just op himself and do it. In that he even bothered to bring up his concerns, it showed he wanted other&#39;s opinions on the matter, because it was only a possibility he had considered. <a href="" title="User:Jennavecia">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Lucida Handwriting;color:#9B30FF&#34;&#62;<b>ل</b>enna&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Jennavecia">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Lucida Handwriting;color:#63B8FF&#34;&#62;vecia&#60;/span&#62;</a> 17:02, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>This is not exactly correct. In short, what happened was a situation in which the most likely interpretation is an attempt to frame another user. The auto-connect/auto-rejoin part of Jennavencia&#39;s summary is not accurate, the connections were not made in such a manner that would be consistent with any sort of automatic action. There is no suitable alternative explanation except an attempt to defame or otherwise tarnish another&#39;s reputation, which leads me to question Juliancolton&#39;s maturity. And yes, the channel is Juliancolton&#39;s personal IRC channel. The a simplified sequence of what happened follows: 1) 3 users join the channel. Due to the way they do (many users, rapidly) it is likely they are malicious. 2) Juliancolton blocks these users from continuing 3) Juliancolton comments that these users are &#34;probably&#34; a certain other person 4) Checking, I discovered that these users were actually juliancolton himself. I can think of no way in which one can, without any indication, join an IRC channel on a web client (no autojoining) multiple times. Given the comment that this was &#34;probably&#34; someone else, the only plausible explanation I&#39;ve seen or can imagine is malicious intent.  <a href="" title="User:Prodego">&#60;font color=&#34;darkgreen&#34;&#62;<i>Prodego</i>&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Prodego">&#60;font color=&#34;darkgreen&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 04:01, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>At the time, I had figured Julian was just pulling a prank, trying to make us think the room was under attack by a <a href="" title="botnet">botnet</a>, just for the fun of it, since botnet attacks had been occurring with some regularity on other Wikipedia channels. This puzzled me because it really was out-of-chracter behavior for him.  Some days later, though, a similar flood of joins occurred in which there were 3 different IP addresses mixed together, of which one was Julian&#39;s and two belonged to nobody I can recognize.  (Freenode IRC masks the IP&#39;s of regular users; I only know what Julian&#39;s IP is because it sometimes shows up after an accidental disconnect.)  I still don&#39;t really know what really happened, but it doesn&#39;t seem possible to me for Julian to be responsible.  Prodego and I talked about this on IRC for awhile yesterday and we still disagree.  To be fair, I think that Prodego&#39;s main reason for mistrust is that Julian seemed to want to blame the event on a certain other user, irregardless of whether Julian had been the one really responsible or not.  Thus, I don&#39;t think anything that is said here will cause Prodego to change his mind. -- <i>&#60;B&#62;<a href="" title="User:Soap">Soap</a>&#60;/B&#62;</i> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Soap">Talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62;/&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Soap">Contributions</a>&#60;/sub&#62; 03:15, 10 July 2009 (UTC) </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<dd>Just my opinion of course, but to me that falls under the &#34;Thank god someone is doing it.&#34; category. Afd is/was always backlogged and its great to see someone doing that much work there. As with Wehwalt he can definitely have my share. -<a href="" title="User:Djsasso">Djsasso</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Djsasso">talk</a>) 13:28, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I think DGG&#39;s larger point is well taken. Most of what an admin does involves judgement calls (should I protect for 1, 2,4 weeks? block for x time period? give more weight to this argument over that?) The more admins contributing the more the variance in these calls (which is good!) and it is probably not a good idea for one admin to dominate any one area. I think juliancolton is probably more interested in backlog reduction rather than monopolization but what DGG says is reasonable. --<a href="" title="User:RegentsPark">RegentsPark</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:RegentsPark">sticks and stones</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 14:35, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>But as a grounds to oppose a RfB it is questionable.  Wikipedia works this way.  People step up to do things, improve the article on the Acme Widget Company, close AfD&#39;s, whatever.  Julian stepped into a vacuum here, a situation where there was a need, and he did the work.  In the absence of any diffs showing that this caused hard feelings, I have to assume his actions were welcome among those who close AfD&#39;s.  And since DGG is an admin, all I can say is that if he feels Juliancolton is unfairly carrying too much of the load, he needs to lift that barge and tote that bale!--<a href="" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wehwalt">talk</a>) 14:45, 8 July 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I wouldn&#39;t oppose based on this because I think the candidate&#39;s motivation is backlog reduction rather than an attempt at monopolization but I think it is important to note that DGG has specifically referred to a high number of early closures in his question (early closures are preemptive and make it hard for other admins to step up to the plate and excessive early closures actually discourage participation). You or I may not oppose for the same reason but the oppose is reasonable. --<a href="" title="User:RegentsPark">RegentsPark</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:RegentsPark">sticks and stones</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 14:56, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>DGG - if he is &#34;monopolizing&#34; AfDs, why not give him another set of tools that would take away from his time at AfD? If he is &#34;monopolozing&#34; AfDs, why not close some yourself and take away from his ability to close AfDs? If he is &#34;monopolizing&#34; AfDs and it causes a problem, why not perform a Deletion Review? There are many options, but none of these involve an oppose. Sheer amount of administrative actions is not a legitimate oppose. You seem to be arguing that he does his job too well.

<li><b>Regretful oppose</b>.  Largely per the answers to the sections of question 8.  I cannot claim to know how the process works on the candidate&#39;s end but the answers - along with a perusal of closure behavior at AfD - lead me to believe that the candidate demonstrates an occasionally cavalier attitude toward the closing of discussions.  I understand that he has given what appears to be a rational answer to the questions, and I don&#39;t believe that there is any inherent problem with how he has been handling the closing of deletion debates, however I am not certain that sort of behavior is something I want to see applied to the far more delicate issue of closing a request for adminship.  A fantastic administrator to be sure, but doesn&#39;t quite instill the amount of faith I need to support this request.

<li>Reluctantly.  I like this user a lot.  He has generated a tremendous amount of high quality content and should be applauded for it.  His admin log is highly impressive with respect to the effort he has put into maintaining the encyclopedia.  There are few who are so dedicated to the project, which is why I find it difficult to oppose here.  My rationale for opposing is twofold: (1) I have not been convinced by either the nom or the answers to the questions (particularly those posed by DGG) that this user has the adequate judgment to gauge consensus for promoting admins (the Friday RfC linked to above signed off by this user was also worrisome wrt judgment); and (2) I have been sufficiently dissatisfied by bureaucrat judgment to set a far higher bar than I ordinarily would at RfB. -- <a href="" title="User:Samir">Samir</a> 06:53, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> I can see that Juliancolton is a good admin who I have found to be polite but in the two major cases I have come across Juliancolton I have found that his reasoning is a bit flawed. He passed a GA for <a href="" title="Tropical Storm Nana (2008)">Tropical Storm Nana (2008)</a> after I had suggested on the talk page that it had notability problems. The discussion on notability was then carried out after the article was passed rather than getting consensus first. On the other occassion I felt he AfD&#39;d <a href="" title="Mass rape in the Bosnian War">Mass rape in the Bosnian War</a> when it should have been cleaned up. I felt his motivation was probably a battle with sockpuppets (annoying I will concede) rather than a clearly thought out case as to why the article should not exist. <a href="" title="User:Polargeo">Polargeo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Polargeo">talk</a>) 10:15, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yes but they are the only two cases I have personally been involved with Juliancolton on wikipedia enough to assess his actions. I thought his judgement was off on both occassions. Therefore I believe that he is not ready for even more responsibility. Please <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Assume_good_faith">assume good faith</a> and don&#39;t throw vague accusations at me in the hope of slurring my name. I came across the Balkan article in an AfD proposed by Juliancolton.

<dd>Okay, &#34;OR&#34; makes it vague. No deletion review needed, result no consensus I moved the article myself to avoid another round of debate.

<dd>I should point out, Polargo, that both the GA and FA criteria do not mention notability, which is a separate issue. Articles have been passed at FA that didn&#39;t meet notability criteria (rare, but it happens.)

<dd>Okay thanks for the clarification on that. Anyway based on both cases I still feel that his judgement is off and he is not quite ready for the bureaucrat role.

<dd>Another note. If you read my interaction with Julian on <a href="#Notability" title="Talk:Tropical_Storm_Nana_(2008)">Talk:Tropical_Storm_Nana_(2008)</a> you will see that it is not really just a technicality of passing the GA I am at odds with. It is that I believe upholding Not the news takes wikipedia beyond a dumping ground for information. Taking fleeting tropical storms that don&#39;t make land to GA and even FA shows that Julian is fundamentally going against what I believe is valuable in the project. I am happy for the tropical cyclone people to clone articles and add a few weather forecasts in as secondary references to make them &#39;notable&#39; but I would prefer not to have people with those inclinations at bureaucrat level with even more influence, even if only a bit. I hope Julian comes away from this line of work and concentrates on becoming an excellent admin and maybe I will vote for him in the future. <a href="" title="User:Polargeo">Polargeo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Polargeo">talk</a>) 21:48, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose</b>, reluctantly because I believe Julian is a fine editor and a decent admin, but the comments above raise too many questions for me to have absolute confidence in his judgement when deciding consensus in the borderline cases. A secondary concern is the impression given by the many positons he already holds - admin here and on Simple English Wikipedia, Simple English Wikiquote, and Commons - that he&#39;s perhaps spreading himself a bit too thinly. I can&#39;t think of another way to put this so I hope I can say it without causing offence to Julian, but I get the impression that he&#39;s <a href="" title="WP:MMO">levelling up</a>. <a href="" title="User:EyeSerene">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:#4B0082&#34;&#62;EyeSerene&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:EyeSerene">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#6B8E23&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 12:02, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you for your reply, and for understanding the tenor of my comment. I value your contributions highly; I&#39;ve often seen you around (especially at GA with another of those damn hurricane articles!), and you&#39;ve certainly proved yourself as an editor and an admin. As Hammersoft notes below though, you haven&#39;t been an admin for a year yet, and with your additional commitments to other projects I don&#39;t see how you&#39;ll have the time to devote to doing the job of a bureaucrat properly. You have many, if not most, of the qualities I&#39;d like to see in a &#39;crat, but I suspect that the reason for some of the issues raised is that you haven&#39;t always taken (or been able to take) the time to examine an issue thoroughly before acting - and the consequences increase with increased authority. Beyond a certain point I believe racking up positions as you have (even though undoubtedly well-earned), is counter-productive, and performance inevitably suffers. If I accept your assurance that you&#39;re not trophy-hunting, I must still question your judgement in standing for RfB given the many other calls on your time. <a href="" title="User:EyeSerene">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:#4B0082&#34;&#62;EyeSerene&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:EyeSerene">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#6B8E23&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 17:22, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

Despite this, I spend the majority of my time at enwiki, as I believe it&#39;s the project that needs my attention the most.

It&#39;s the lack of creating an actual encyclopedia article, and just regurgitating a weather report in slightly modified form. Also per oppose 14, DGG. I&#39;m fearful of him monopolizing the RfA process and doing so in a way akin to his work at AfD, which flows into another reason to oppose; his answers to the questions 8a-e, especially &#39;c&#39;.

<li><b>Oppose</b> - From my experience Juliancolton is an excellent admin, but I don&#39;t think he is ready to be a &#39;crat.  I am also troubled by the issues raised by DGG in Q8.  The combination of ignoring process to close many &#34;tough&#34; AfDs early combined with the sheer number JC closes gives me the distinct impression that he feels his own judgment is best.  It doesn&#39;t help that he almost never explains his rationale; often it is not at all clear to the average user why a given AfD is a keep/delete when numbers are close.  No offense is attended, and my impressions may well be wrong, but I am uneasy enough with JC to oppose. --<a href="" title="User:ThaddeusB">ThaddeusB</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ThaddeusB">talk</a>) 20:53, 8 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I don&#39;t ignore process or consensus, and I wish participants here would understand that.

<dd>By &#34;ignoring process&#34; I meant closing AfDs early.  I do realise it is very common practice to start closing them at ~6.5 days, but I the guidelines do say &#34;discussions are expected to run for at least seven days.&#34;  The fact that most people choose to ignore it doesn&#39;t make it right to do so, IMO.  Yes the extra hours are unlikely to make a difference in 95%+, but that is equally an argument to let them run their course as it is to allow them to close early.  At bare minimum, I do not feel that &#34;close calls&#34; should be closed early.  To me regularly closing close calls early, gives the impression that you &#34;know best&#34; and are concerned an admin who happens to be around at the 7 day mark might not agree.  This is probably not your actual motive, but it is the impression this gives.  Assuming your rationale is to keep a backlog form forming, that can be accomplished just as easily by closing at 7 days + 1 hour as 6 days + 12 hours or 6 days + 20 hours.  To be clear, I am not saying that you actually believe your judgment superior to others - I can&#39;t know your actual feelings and wouldn&#39;t try to guess them.  What I am saying is that is the impression I get form your actions.  My opposing based on my impression of your behavior is no different than someone supporting based on their impressions. --<a href="" title="User:ThaddeusB">ThaddeusB</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ThaddeusB">talk</a>) 22:33, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>I understand that you don&#39;t like some of Julian&#39;s AfD closing practices, but I can&#39;t see how AfD closures have anything to do with his abilities to close RfAs, approve bots, or rename users.

<dd>Flagging bots is extremely no big deal, as BAG does the actual approving in all cases, as far as I know. Renaming users requires a slight bit of judgment, but is mostly not a big deal as well. However, how a user closes AfDs if the best available evidence of how he/she is likely to close RfAs.

<li><b>Oppose</b>. I&#39;ve only been aware of Juliancolton as an editor here for a month or two, and while I&#39;ve seen some good work in that time I&#39;ve also been generally concerned about his judgment on several occasions. I&#39;m not going to bother with diffs since this is my subjective opinion, but this impression is strong enough (and has developed over time rather than being based on one or two incidents) to make me oppose here (I rarely participate at this page in either RfBs or RfAs). Additionally, I&#39;ve seen Julian at AfD (I close them from time to time) and like DGG have been concerned by the sheer quantity of his closes, and the tendency to provide no (or very little) explanation of possibly controversial closes. I&#39;m more interested in quality rather than quantity in AfD closes, and I think all but the most obvious closes deserve some level of explanation as to rationale. Julian seems to feel differently (though I note and appreciate the comments that he will work to improve on this), and I can imagine this issue carrying over to closures of AfDs as a bureaucrat. The preceding <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_bureaucratship%2FJuliancolton&#38;diff=301062790&#38;oldid=301062442" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3ARequests_for_bureaucratship%2FJuliancolton&#38;diff=301062790&#38;oldid=301062442">comment</a> by JC essentially reinforces my opposition, particularly when he notes &#34;I don&#39;t ignore process or consensus, and I wish participants here would understand that.&#34; Maybe that&#39;s true, but it&#39;s a topic open for debate, and I find it rather unseemly that Julian would essentially say &#34;please understand that I do a good job because that is a fact&#34; here on his RfB. The response to OwenX&#39;s oppose above is similar, as Julian justifies <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Charlie the Unicorn (2nd nomination)">this close</a> (which itself had the extremely weak, begging-the-question, rationale of &#34;the arguments for deletion are stronger than those for keeping the page&#34;) by saying &#34;consensus seemed clear to me.&#34; That&#39;s unsurprising, but presumably it was not clear to others, and I see a pattern here where Julian seems to justify his decisions by essentially saying &#34;the decision was justified.&#34; Given that, I don&#39;t think it appropriate to elevate him to the &#39;crat position. I don&#39;t enjoy opposing folks here, but I do think it was necessary in this case, and I would conclude by saying that Julian clearly does a lot of great work here (more so than most of us) and I think it&#39;s important to acknowledge that. --<a href="" title="User:Bigtimepeace">Bigtimepeace</a> &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User_talk:Bigtimepeace">talk</a> |  <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Bigtimepeace">contribs</a>&#60;/small&#62; 21:23, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> I&#39;ve been trying to decide if I want to oppose or if I really care enough to participate in this. I cannot ignore the maturity issues, compounded by Julian&#39;s assertions that skepticism of the judgment of teenage admins is tantamount to racial discrimination. As I previously stated, I think such comparisons (akin to two editors I&#39;ve witnessed claiming perceived unfair attacks were &#34;gang rape&#34;) are evidence that these folks clearly do not understand what these wholly unpleasant things mean. Further, Julian&#39;s specialized niche in articles limits his perceptions of greater article constructing issues. I completely respect the articles Julian has constructed, but without branching out and staying in a topic that may never get put on the main page and may never be confronted by content disputes does not offer the kind of forethought and understanding I would like to see in a bureaucrat. Lastly, although I could thrust both arms in a meat grinder and still count on one hand the number of other editors I admire and defer to, Julian is not one of them. That&#39;s not necessarily bad (apparently nearly statistically impossible, but not his fault), but that&#39;s my ounce of pretention. I agree with Bigtimepeace. I dislike opposing, but these things are worrying me. --<a href="" title="User:Moni3">Moni3</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Moni3">talk</a>) 21:54, 8 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Julian could have nipped this in the bud by telling us in the first place how old he is. I have to ask why he said his age-range is 14–17, if he&#39;s not 14 years old. It&#39;s all a little coy, when what we want from a crat is crystal-clear judgement and expression in potentially complex situations. Majorly, for a 15-year-old to be sufficiently mature to handle the complex situations s/he needs to deal with at WP would be very, very rare. A social genius, in fact. I can only voice my concerns that promotion to crat is a special thing, and I wonder what the rush is for such a young person, when there are so many ways in which he is already helping the project and acquiring expertise.

<li><b>Oppose</b> I&#39;ve debated off an on since this RfB started whether I wanted to chime in or not, and finally decided that I might as well. My main reason to oppose is per   as I totally agree with his/her point that &#34;I do feel very strongly that WMF should not be granting extra rights to those who are not of the age of majority in the jurisdictions in which WMF operates&#34;. Yes, this is ageist, but it is my opinion and it is no less valid than any other opinion voiced here. The concerns raised by EyeSerene are also valid to me as I also get the impressive that you&#39;re trying to take on too much and spread yourself too thin. I also agree with DGG in that the monopolization of AfD bothers me, as well. Your age wasn&#39;t enough to oppose off the bat, but coupled with the other concerns expressed here, leads me to this conclusion.

<li><b>Oppose.</b> Unlike DGG, my concern is not the <i>number</i> of AfD Juliancolton closes, as such - indeed, he should be complimented for doing a lot of difficult admin work that tends to get one yelled at rather often. My concern is that he admits to closing many AfDs out of process, i.e., too early (even if only by hours or minutes). I feel that this is a serious problem, because this leads to a situation where most AfDs are closed by a minority of admins who are willing to ignoring proper procedure, and few if any (<a href="" title="WP:AFD/Old">WP:AFD/Old</a> is most often empty or almost empty at the time it is refreshed by a bot) are closed by the majority of admins who do observe process. This is not desirable. This pattern of conduct, and his answer to DGG&#39;s question 8b (a mere reference to <a href="" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a>) may be indicative of a somewhat cavalier attitude to process that I believe would be most inappropriate in a bureaucrat – I am not keen to see admin candidates promoted &#34;per IAR&#34;. &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Sandstein">&#60;font style=&#34;color:white;background:blue;font-family:sans-serif;&#34;&#62;<b>&#38;nbsp;Sandstein&#38;nbsp;</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 14:34, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>RfAs have a more definitive time limit than AfDs; AfDs are recommended to stay open for seven days, though they can be closed earlier if consensus is clear.

<li><b>Oppose</b> - Julian is obviously a very valuable contributor and administrator. However, I have concerns about age (sorry, but I do) and about issues raised above of closing non-concensus AfDs as delete.

<li><b>Oppose</b> JC is a fine fellow, one for whom I have a good deal of affection, who is a good contributor and valuable member of project, and with whose views I am often in sympathy.  I am concerned, though, per DGG, et al., that he not infrequently fails properly to interpret consensus-based discussions (although his answers to most of the &#34;how would you close?&#34; questions strike me as correct).  I am not at all sure that I would not again support him were he a candidate at RfA (I didn&#39;t !vote in RfA 3, being disinclined to participate in discussions of which the outcome is certain, unless I&#39;ve something unsaid to note, but I thought it clear that JC&#39;s sysop[p]ing should be a net positive), but, for various reasons, not least the difficulty of the community&#39;s readily reversing bureaucrat error, we apply a more rigorous standard at RfB; on a full consideration of the candidate&#39;s record, then, I cannot conclude with sufficient confidence that the net effect on the project of his being promoted should be positive, noting once more that I regret that I&#39;ve to reach that conclusion and that it is one that I should be pleased to reconsider in the future.  <a href="" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Jahiegel">talk</a>) 20:37, 9 July 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>I have been thinking about this one for a while. I believe the age concerns are absurd and boil down to being nothing more than irrelevant canards, and they bear no influence in my opinion. However, what really concerns me here is the raw volume of contributions, and the speed at which they are done. Adding more hats to JC&#39;s head—and specially the bureaucrat bit, the most exhausting hat in Wiki outside the arbitration committee—would probably result in premature burnout. Additionally, I have some concerns about stubbornness, from my interactions with him in <a href="" title="WP:WPTC">WikiProject Tropical Cyclones</a>. Finally, JC has been an admin less than a year; I consider a one-year adminship tenure a prerequisite for bureaucratship.

<dd>Well, I often use automated or semi-automated scripts, which results in a high quantity of edits. This isn&#39;t a bad thing in my view; we have millions of articles that require some sort of cleanup, so I think automated editing is an absolute necessity if we want to preform said cleanup efficiently. I don&#39;t particularly care about my editcount, however, so you can be assured I don&#39;t suffer editcountitis. :) –<b><a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT;color:#36648B&#34;&#62;Juliancolton&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#38;nbsp;&#38;#124;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User_talk:Juliancolton">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:gray&#34;&#62;<i>Talk</i>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 22:53, 9 July 2009 (UTC)

<dd>As I pointed out on Moni3&#39;s talk page, Julian has helped me in various pages that I have worked on, which include literature, biography, history, and theatre. He was a great help on and off Wiki on <a href="" title="Christopher Smart&#39;s asylum confinement">Christopher Smart&#39;s asylum confinement</a>, for example. He has obviously spent time on both the weather and roads wikiprojects, but he does work on MilHistory articles also.

<dd>Yes, but it&#39;s so much different when the article&#39;s primary author is the focus of complaint or what the primary author has produced is called into question. Helping out is nice, but unless the work being called into question is the product of hours, weeks, or months of Juliancolton&#39;s time, effort, money, intelligence, reading comprehension and writing skills, he&#39;s just  patiently explaining Wikipedia policy to someone who may not understand. He can disengage at any time, and the article&#39;s content is no reflection on him. How likely is it that someone will announce on a tropical storm article page, &#34;Bullshit, Sunny Jim. Your sources are awful and you can&#39;t read them anyway. This article is full of errors and your POV is beaming out of the article like the morning sun.&#34; But, you know, four or five talk page archives of that. ANI threads, RfCs, dispute resolution, mediation, ArbCom. There are articles I might be very tempted to write except for the time and effort it might take just to get through the talk pages.

<dd>Actually, Moni, I was involved along side of JC in a content dispute that split the weather project.

I respect your judgement, but I respect Moni3&#39;s judgment too, and I don&#39;t have the benefit of a history of personal interaction with Julian, or much observation of him that I could call upon ... all of which is making this rather difficult. I am looking for my zip now, so I can neatly divide myself in two halves. ;) This RfB will still stay open for a good few days; let me think about it, I&#39;ll keep watching the page.

<dl>
<dd>The &#34;aura of authority&#34; that you are speaking of relates to admins&#39; opinions in content disputes, on noticeboards, and so forth. While their <i>opinions</i> are not weighted any more than other users, administrators are given wide leeway to interpret and implement applicable policy through blocks, deletions, and protections. Bureaucrats can have a far greater impact even than administrators as they must determine whether there is consensus to promote users in extremely close RfAs and RfBs. For better or for worse, the promotion of any user to sysop or crat can have a tremendous impact on the entire project. Since admins and crats are allowed, even encouraged, to use their judgment to implement policies, this does translate to some form of authority; at some point in time, they <b>will</b> be asked to make a decision of which option to choose in closely contested arguments. As with any position, that authority (whether it is merely implied or not) comes with the responsibility to use your user rights wisely and fairly. I believe Giano is saying that he does not think that Julian is old enough to be able to fill the role of a bureaucrat well, because the amount of responsibility placed on bureaucrats is very great. <a href="" title="User:J.delanoy">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;J<b>.</b>delanoy&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User Talk:J.delanoy">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;gabs&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a><a href="" title="Special:Contributions/J.delanoy">&#60;font color=&#34;blue&#34;&#62;&#60;sub&#62;adds&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 15:14, 10 July 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If you are talking to me, I would respectfully point out to you that you should treat all users comments with respect, my oppose was well considered after 4 days of watching the thread develop and reading the comments and talk. My oppose was in direct response to Julians answer to question 4, where he himself says that his opinions are fluid  and still developing. Another of my unwritten rules is that nominees for Bureaucratship should have at least two years of exemplary service as an Administrator. My oppose is further encouraged by the (Imo) aggressive interrogation of the opposes by the friends of the nominee. I also don&#39;t oppose reluctantly, I oppose with confidence.(<a href="" title="User:Off2riorob">Off2riorob</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Off2riorob">talk</a>) 17:26, 11 July 2009 (UTC))</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></li>

<li>I&#39;m impressed by his devotion to the project and the amount of work he obviously puts into it.  In fact, I recently supported his adminship at Commons. But I do believe that &#39;crats should ideally be drawn from our most experienced admins. He&#39;s had the mop for less than 10&#38;nbsp;months, and I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s long enough. As he himself acknowledges in Q4, his views are becoming more tempered as he is gaining more experience as an admin. Experience is a valuable teacher and I&#39;d be happy to support him for &#39;crat later on, but not just yet. Very sorry, Julian. &#60;i&#62;&#60;b&#62;&#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid black;padding:1px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:JGHowes">&#60;font style=&#34;color:white;background:#008000;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;JGHowes&#38;nbsp; &#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;blue&#34;&#62; &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:JGHowes"><i>talk</i></a>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/i&#62; 13:39, 11 July 2009 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I must say that I, too, read JC&#39;s comment as an endorsement of the thinking set forth in the close, not just as a celebration of the result, for which no one would fault him, or a generic appreciation for a bureaucrat&#39;s making a thoughtful close in a contentious discussion, whatever the outcome (that reading may be much too broad, and I am sure that someone will ask Julian how, were he uninvolved, he would have closed the instant RfA, such that any confusion should be resolved).  The major concern of many of those opposing is that the candidate too often misreads consensus (unintentionally, to be sure), and his apparent agreement with an RfA result in which the closer substituted his judgment for that community is not unworthy of note (and, to my mind, at least a bit problematic).  <a href="" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Jahiegel">talk</a>) 21:25, 11 July 2009 (UTC)

In this case enthusiasm to help the project is perceived by some as (perhaps youth-related) impatience/eagerness. This could easily be addressed by waiting six months or so.

Note that this objection is separate from the simple maturity arguments (on which I take no position) but really has to do more with working conditions for minors.  It is not prudent of the community to ask self-admitted minors to take on tasks of combatting libel, copyright violation, obscenity and profanity, and threats of various kinds.

<li><b>Oppose</b> Julian, I&#39;ve waited until the last minute for this because I really didn&#39;t know how I was going to !vote. Looking at the current tally, I don&#39;t suppose this makes much difference, and that is okay, because there&#39;s only a few niggling things that are stopping me from supporting. It&#39;s odd, because I always thought that if and when you had an RfB, I would wholeheartedly support, but after a long consideration I just don&#39;t feel comfortable enough to do so. It isn&#39;t a decision I&#39;ve come to lightly; I regard you as a good friend, an excellent administrator, and an excellent editor. Every single interaction I&#39;ve seen you involved in, you&#39;ve been polite, civil, respectful, you don&#39;t rush into decisions (except perhaps some AfD closures!), you can hold your own when you believe in something, and for your age, highly intelligent. I&#39;ve come to you a few times for advice re admin-related matters, even though I&#39;m almost twice your age and became an admin a few months before you. You do your fair share of admin work, and a lot of other admins&#39;s share of work, too – mine included if I&#39;m being honest; however, after saying all that, I don&#39;t think that you should be a bureaucrat yet. Yeah, it&#39;s just a couple more buttons, and there&#39;s not that much more you&#39;ll be doing, but what you will be doing and the decisions you&#39;ll be making are IMO far more important than those of an administrator, and I think it would be better for our crats to be of majority age. The other thing goes back to my point about doing more than your fair share of admin work, you&#39;re active in many many places, both on Wikipedia and three other sister projects. While I don&#39;t have a problem, per se, with this, because you seem to be coping, I think adding Crat to your <a href="" title="CV">CV</a> would be spreading you a little too thin. We&#39;ve seen it a few times when crats stop becoming editors and admins, and I think it would be a loss if that happened in your case. I was going to put this in the Neutral section, but there&#39;s no point being indecisive and wishy-washy about it when I&#39;ve decided not to support. I wish it was a support, but right now I like the idea of you as an admin more than I do you as a crat.

<li><b>Oppose</b> User is very industrious and helpful but still a child.  More importantly, DGG brought up some valid concerns about JC&#39;s hasty, high-volume approach to closing AfDs.

<dd>Hi, have you considered he&#39;s never been advised about concerns over the high volume closures before? Either on his talk page or admin review.  It sucks that the community was happy to have him expending all that energy to do a thankless job keeping down backlogs in that key area, only to have it held against him now.  I&#39;ve found julian to be very responsive to community concerns, but he&#39;s not psychic! No way would he rush to close RfAs, theres no similar preasure to AfDs and the community has now made its desire for thoughtfull closures known. <a href="" title="User:FeydHuxtable">FeydHuxtable</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:FeydHuxtable">talk</a>) 13:28, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose</b> - It isn&#39;t &#34;ageism&#34; to say that I believe it&#39;s in the best interest of Wikipedia to have people in positions of trust who are legally of age.  Yes, plenty of teenagers are more mature than my 30-something coworkers, but that isn&#39;t the point.  Also, I&#39;m not thrilled with the notion on the talk page that Juliancolton raised about only working with changing usernames and not handling RFA closures.  There&#39;s no such thing as a partial bureaucrat - there is a substantial risk if the tools were ever misused - a rogue bureaucrat could potentially wreak havoc on the server and so we shouldn&#39;t be handing out this position lightly or to someone who is only partially trusted. --<a href="" title="User:B">B</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:B">talk</a>) 14:11, 13 July 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose</b>.  The position of bureaucrat, I should think, is properly regarded as one of very significant responsibility for the community as a whole.  IMO, this promising admin needs more time to develop further and more opportunity to demonstrate long-term stability and a keener depth of insight into the kinds of issues that bureaucrats are regularly expected to confront. Neither Julian&#39;s record as admin to date nor his responses to questions presented above on this page, IMO, reflect the level of depth of insight that bureaucrats need possess in order to function effectively in that capacity. I&#39;m not saying Julian isn&#39;t capable of possessing these, but IMO an appropriate level of long-term competence and insight into the issues simply hasn&#39;t been adequately demonstrated to the community to date. ... <a href="" title="User:Kenosis">Kenosis</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kenosis">talk</a>) 15:43, 13 July 2009 (UTC) &#60;br&#62;.....

<li><b>Oppose</b> reluctantly.  I&#39;ve mostly observed Julian at AfD.

<dd>&#60;s&#62;Neutral for now&#60;/s&#62;Moving to <b>support</b>. My limited interactions with Juliancolton before recently have left me with confidence that he know what he does. The interactions around Davemeistermoab&#39;s RfA do leave me with a lot of respect for the way he&#39;s standing up for his nominee even if I don&#39;t agree with it. We are however not on the same wavelength in terms of defining adminship, which at present bugs me enough for a neutral vote for a crat role, in other words, where the very definition of what adminship is about will guide closures. <a href="" title="User:MLauba">MLauba</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:MLauba">talk</a>) 22:11, 7 July 2009 (UTC)

While I would normally support based solely upon the latter, some of the opposes, especially the AfD ones, deeply concern me. While I still believe that I can trust him in closing RfA&#39;s&#38;mdash;while similar, editor promotion/no promotion seems rather different to me than AfD&#38;mdash;I am on a seesaw right now and cannot decide.

<li><b>Neutral</b>. I tend to agree with some of the opposers, especially Sandstein and DeanB. In my experience, Juliancolton is a good admin, and we don&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) require perfection here. However, one of the main tasks of a bureaucrat is to explain thought processes when performing actions, and it appears that Julian tends to avoid that. I can only remember one time I&#39;ve interacted with Julian personally; he reverted me when I&#39;d removed (what I thought was) an unnecessary disambiguator from <a href="" title="Tropical Storm Nicholas (2003)">Tropical Storm Nicholas (2003)</a>; there is no article at the plain title, and no ambiguity. He was kind enough to leave a note on my talk page (see <a href="#Tropical_Storm_Nicholas_.282003.29" title="User talk:Dekimasu">User talk:Dekimasu</a>), but when I explained my reasoning in detail, he declined to engage. He appeared to agree with me, but then stated he felt the disambiguator should remain in place. We both left it there. There&#39;s nothing really wrong with that on an editorial level; it&#39;s a normal interaction between two editors. On the other hand, for this position, we need people who are willing to engage in detail on matters of process.
