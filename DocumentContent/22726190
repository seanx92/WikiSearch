<p>WP:REALNAME states the following:

<dl>
<dd>&#34;You should not register under any name that would lead others to assume your account is associated with any person other than yourself.&#34;</dd></dl>
<p>However, now that online personalities (ie <a href="" title="List of YouTube celebrities">YouTube &#34;stars&#34;</a> and <a href="" title="moot (4chan)">moot</a>) are increasingly becoming well-known in the media and Wikipedia itself, this policy seems to require some broadening. It is no longer only real names but also usernames that are in need of protection. Of course, such a policy would be required to adhere to notability guidelines (so <a href="" title="Philip DeFranco">sxephil</a> would be protected, but, say, &#34;darkchaosknight&#34; wouldn&#39;t). Thus, I am proposing the addition of new policy concerning using not only notable real names, but also notable usernames. If this has already been propsed, 죄송. &#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;border: 1px solid&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Aar"><b>&#60;span style=&#34;background-color:White; color:#003333&#34;&#62; &#38;nbsp;Aar&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</b></a><a href="" title="User talk:Aar">&#60;span style=&#34;background-color:#003333; color:White&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;►&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 21:14, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>This already falls under <a href="" title="WP:IU">the &#34;misleading usernames&#34;</a> clause of the policy. At least that&#39;s how I would interpret this case.

<p>There are various kinds of articles on Wikipedia, if an article is a biography about someone and part of this biography outlines their thoughts but isn&#39;t about the &#34;Philosophy of&#34; this individual - there are in fact other articles specifically about their philosophy, where is it stated in Wikipedia policy that &#34;all significant viewpoints&#34; means it&#39;s considered appropriate to cite criticisms of their work and thoughts in the biography. As opposed to meaning that facts about their lives and the fact that they authored certain works should be accurately presented - or if there&#39;s dispute about certain details that viewpoints regarding those factual disputes are represented?<a href="" title="User:TheDarkOneLives">TheDarkOneLives</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TheDarkOneLives">talk</a>) 22:05, 22 April 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, it makes a difference. By looking at the actual article and article history we can form our own judgments about the facts, rather than relying on the characterizations of involved editors. <a href="" title="User:Dlabtot">Dlabtot</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dlabtot">talk</a>) 23:30, 22 April 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I&#39;m trying to understand your question... are you asking whether the <a href="" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a> article should have a <a href="#Literary_criticism" title="Ayn_Rand">Literary criticism</a> section? <a href="" title="User:Dlabtot">Dlabtot</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dlabtot">talk</a>) 23:58, 22 April 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I&#39;m asking if the &#34;all significant viewpoints&#34; means it&#39;s considered standard practice that an article that&#39;s supposed to be a biography should include criticism regarding the person&#39;s works - and if so where specifically this is addressed in policy? The Ayn Rand article is one I&#39;m looking at. I&#39;ve noticed people will cite &#34;policy&#34; in ways that don&#39;t seem supported by what the policy actually says.<a href="" title="User:TheDarkOneLives">TheDarkOneLives</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TheDarkOneLives">talk</a>) 02:19, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would have to say that an author&#39;s WP article should include coverage of their works and significant viewpoints about those works, yes. For example, in the <a href="" title="Leo Tolstoy">Leo Tolstoy</a> article, you can see criticism of Tolstoy&#39;s works from Dostoevsky, Chekhov, Woolf, Joyce, Mann and others... of course the criticism of Tolstoy is a bit more positive than that bestowed on Ms. Rand... <a href="" title="User:Dlabtot">Dlabtot</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dlabtot">talk</a>) 02:38, 23 April 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But my question is where is this addressed specifically in policy that &#34;all significant viewpoints should be represented&#34; means critiques of an author belong in their biography?<a href="" title="User:TheDarkOneLives">TheDarkOneLives</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TheDarkOneLives">talk</a>) 03:51, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

<dd>There are lots of examples.  A person is a philosopher, and their biography is mostly about their philosophy.  Examples:  <a href="" title="John Rawls">John Rawls</a>, <a href="" title="Alonso Church">Alonso Church</a>, <a href="" title="Saul Kripke">Saul Kripke</a>, <a href="" title="Donald Davidson">Donald Davidson</a>.  Seems to be the standard.  Sometimes, someone else&#39;s viewpoints are included, but often, not all significant viewpoints.  What I wonder about is just how much trivia is to be tolerated in articles like this when there are no citations for it (like, if someone started talking about what <a href="" title="Ayn Rand">Ayn Rand</a> likes to eat or what music she liked, but there are no sources.  It&#39;s easy to find sources for the philosophical content and for disagreements about the philosophical content, not so easy for personal details, but still the details often remain.  There are many philosopher-bios that contain absolutely no viewpoints besides the one of the person who is the subject (and some of those are self-edited).  Makes writing those bios really challenging, but interesting.  People should be encouraged to put up the various significant viewpoints that disagree with the person&#39;s viewpoint, in question.<a href="" title="User:CDart">CDart</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:CDart">talk</a>) 23:01, 23 April 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;ll try to clarify further. There are two aspects regarding someone&#39;s biography. The historical facts of their life - born on this date, went to this school, married to this person, etc. There can also be their thoughts, their works. Is it <i>specified</i> anywhere that the &#34;all significant points of view&#34; is supposed to apply to both historical and intellectual aspects?<a href="" title="User:TheDarkOneLives">TheDarkOneLives</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TheDarkOneLives">talk</a>) 10:25, 24 April 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Rand is notable for her books and her philosophy (which are of course closely related). Considering how incredibly controversial both were (and are) it absolutely makes sense for criticism to be included in the article about them. <a href="" title="User:TallNapoleon">TallNapoleon</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TallNapoleon">talk</a>) 07:01, 28 April 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That doesn&#39;t answer the question. Cite where it&#39;s specifically stated that &#34;all significant viewpoints&#34; is applicable to the thoughts of the subject of an article, rather than just historical facts.<a href="" title="User:TheDarkOneLives">TheDarkOneLives</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TheDarkOneLives">talk</a>) 06:49, 29 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>May I suggest you read <a href="" title="Wikipedia:The rules are principles">Wikipedia:The rules are principles</a>, an excellent essay that encourages people to focus on the intent of our policies and guidelines and not on the &#34;specific&#34; language.  We should always express all significant points of view in all of our articles... biographies included.  </dd>
<dd>That said, I would agree that Rand&#39;s work is complex enough that we should probably not get into details on her works and thoughts in the Bio article... and should have a seperate sub-article devoted to discussing that work (an article which would include in depth discussion of that work... including criticisms).  The Bio article itself would focus primarily on the <i>events</i> of her life, and less on her works.  While a short paragraph on her works should be included, it should be in summary style... and point the reader to the article that discusses her works in more detail.  In short... note the criticism in passing in the bio article, and point the reader to a seperate article where more in depth discussion is found. <a href="" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Blueboar">talk</a>) 01:57, 5 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Automatic_removal_of_admin_bit_from_inactive_users">Automatic removal of admin bit from inactive users</span></h2>

<p>I call to everyone&#39;s attention <a href="#4chan_hacked_admin_account" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/Incidents">Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/Incidents</a>. I have also made a similar opinion at <a href="" title="WT:RFA">WT:RFA</a> but before the above-linked ANI incident. I think we should consider, as already done with the CheckUser privilege (see <a href="" title="WP:CHECKUSER">WP:CHECKUSER</a>, as mandated by WMF policy), that any user account with admin privileges that has been inactive for an arbitrary length—my recommendation is more than 1 year—should have the admin bit automatically removed; those desysopped in this fashion (i.e. not desysopped due to misuse, abuse, etc.) may simply ask someone, i.e. a Bureaucrat, to restore admin privileges if the user wishes to become active again. I think the likelihood of stuff like the above happening (that is, admin accounts becoming compromised) would be greatly reduced if something like this were to be in place. Any thoughts? <a href="" title="User talk:MuZemike">MuZemike</a> 16:35, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The probability of any given admin account&#39;s password being hacked via brute force is dependent on the strength of the password, and nothing else. Therefore the probability of someone hacking an admin account is dependent solely on the ratio of the number admin accounts with strong passwords to the number of admin accounts with weak passwords. (It only takes one admin account with a weak password for you to be successful, and your chances of finding such a password is only dependent on the ratio of strong to weak passwords.) Unless a convincing argument can be made that a disproportionate number of admin accounts with weak passwords are inactive, the probability of someone successfully hacking an admin account would not be changed by reducing the total number of admin accounts. In fact, by far the easiest way to hack an admin account would be to gain access to a computer with the account already signed in or to intercept the password of someone signing in with a hardware or software keystroke logger, both of which are only possible with an active account. Therefore a reduction in inactive admin accounts would in all likelihood have virtually no effect on security whatsoever.--<a href="" title="User:Dycedarg">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000&#34;&#62;<b>Dycedarg</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b>&#60;span style=&#34;color:#000000&#34;&#62;&#38;#x0436;&#60;/span&#62;</b></a> 17:12, 29 April 2009 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>No it does not. I&#39;ll try to explain my logic more carefully: If one is going to brute force hack an admin account, all one needs is to find <b>one</b> admin account with a weak password. Lacking the password hashes that should only exist inaccessibly on the servers, the hackers have no better means of finding accounts with weak passwords than to pick passwords at random, try to hack them until they have determined that the passwords are strong, and then try again. The chances of their obtaining a weak password in their random searches are not determined by the total number of weak passwords in the available pool of passwords, but by the number of weak passwords when compared to the number of strong passwords. If deactivating the inactive admin accounts does not affect this ratio (and there is absolutely no reason I can see that it would), then it will have no effect on the effectiveness of such a search, and therefore have no effect on the security of the site. The chances of their getting an account with a strong password in any give search remain the same. If anything, decreasing the total pool of admin accounts reduces the number of searches that are likely to be necessary before an account with a weak password is found. Note further that the preceding method of password hacking is the least efficient method of gaining access to an admin account in existence, and if one wanted a password to an admin&#39;s accounts there are numerous easier methods of getting one, and all of said methods that I can think of would require the admin account to be active in order to have any chance of success.--<a href="" title="User:Dycedarg">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000&#34;&#62;<b>Dycedarg</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b>&#60;span style=&#34;color:#000000&#34;&#62;&#38;#x0436;&#60;/span&#62;</b></a> 02:41, 30 April 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Which of course raises the point that the devs have undoubtedly considered the possibility of brute force attacks on admin accounts, and have taken appropriate precautions. I simply find the whole concept of &#34;inactive admin account=security risk&#34; to be rather silly; there is quite simply no demonstrable, tangible, provable risk to having them. Any security gains would be ridiculously minuscule, and utterly not worth the effort of even <i>holding</i> another adminship removal discussion, let alone the effort of implementing such a policy in the unlikely event that someone finally rams it through.--<a href="" title="User:Dycedarg">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000&#34;&#62;<b>Dycedarg</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b>&#60;span style=&#34;color:#000000&#34;&#62;&#38;#x0436;&#60;/span&#62;</b></a> 03:32, 30 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<dd>If the only route by which an inactive admins account could be hacked was by cracking the password then I agree that deactivating the account wouldn&#39;t have a security advantage. But as there are also other ways then yes there would be a security gain to autodesysopping accounts that haven&#39;t edited in 12 months. I think we could have a fairly light touch system on this, auto desysop any admin account that hasn&#39;t edited in 12 months but with the proviso that any crat can restore tools after a months return to activity - that should be enough both for the returning admin to get up to speed with changes on the wiki and for a crat to be able to tell that the user is if not the same editor at least a competent one.  <i><a href="" title="User:WereSpielChequers">&#60;span style=&#34;color:DarkGreen&#34;&#62;Ϣere&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:WereSpielChequers">&#60;span style=&#34;color:DarkRed&#34;&#62;Spiel&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;span style=&#34;color:DarkOrange&#34;&#62;Chequers</i>&#60;/span&#62; 11:05, 2 May 2009 (UTC)

<p>I don&#39;t know if there is a log of times when admins have looked at deleted contributions, or if there is a log who is monitoring, it but as far as I&#39;m aware it is an invisible action though not an invisible change. However I have heard that the power to look at deleted contributions is one of the admin tools that justifies having such a stiff test at RFA. </p>
<p>There is one minor argument for expiry of passwords that is safe to discuss publicly because it is an opportunistic one rather than a loophole available to anyone reading this. Old harddrives especially personal ones are rarely destroyed or erased in a secure manner.  I still have all the PCs I&#39;ve bought in the last ten years, any credit card numbers on the old ones have long had their expiry dates changed, but yes there could be passwords remembered on them for sites and accounts that I haven&#39;t used in years.</p>
<p>Personally I regard 30 day and 45 day expiry of passwords as counterproductive because they encourage people to use post it notes and other aides memoire to keep track of them, but a 6 or 12 month expiry on passwords does sound sensible to me. <i><a href="" title="User:WereSpielChequers">&#60;span style=&#34;color:DarkGreen&#34;&#62;Ϣere&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:WereSpielChequers">&#60;span style=&#34;color:DarkRed&#34;&#62;Spiel&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;span style=&#34;color:DarkOrange&#34;&#62;Chequers</i>&#60;/span&#62; 11:30, 4 May 2009 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>You are correct about the lack of logging for viewing deleted contribs; that&#39;s why I said &#34;almost everything&#34;. I do not feel that the ability to view deleted contribs is of particular consequence at this point. Back when personal information was merely deleted typically instead of oversighted, it might have been a bigger deal, but these days virtually anything that&#39;s been deleted can be requested by an interested third party anyway; the only exception I can think of off-hand would be copyright infringements. It certainly doesn&#39;t seem like the sort of thing you&#39;d hack an account over; hackers seem more interested in the excitement of ruining something than trollng through thousands of deleted revisisons on the off chance that something interesting will come up.</dd>
<dd>You do have a point with that old hard drive thing, but that case presents a particularly minor danger in my view. The person who happens upon that password will be doing so via sheer luck. The probability of that person being someone who both wants to harm Wikipedia and knows how to do so in more than a superficial fashion is so utterly remote that it&#39;s not even really worth mentioning in my opinion. I&#39;m worried about ways that a vandal can actively employ to get a password, not how some random vandal out there might by some miracle happen upon a computer previously owned by an admin who forgot to delete his password. Besides, in the absence of password rotation it is if anything more likely to happen to an active account than an inactive one.</dd>
<dd>That said, I agree that making admins rotate their password every six months to a year makes sense. It&#39;s not that onerous a requirement and it would improve security.--<a href="" title="User:Dycedarg">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000&#34;&#62;<b>Dycedarg</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b>&#60;span style=&#34;color:#000000&#34;&#62;&#38;#x0436;&#60;/span&#62;</b></a> 04:59, 5 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Making_Wikipedia_a_more_reliable_source.">Making Wikipedia a more reliable source.</span></h2>

<p>Currently I am undertaking a research project and I am using Wikipedia articles as reference. Public perception of Wikipedia as a cited source is very low because of the reliability of the information. People understand that there can be erroneous information posted by people that can compromise the integrity of the work that has cited it. I feel that Wikipedia needs to stand behind the articles that are complete and properly referenced with a Certified Seal. This means that the article and the information contained there-in is complete and up-to-date. Obviously leaving room for changes and updates to be made but pages that have been certified would be more heavily scrutinized when any edits are made. I feel this is one positive step in Wikipedia establishing itself as a trusted source. Obviously stubs and incomplete articles or improperly referenced articles would not be certified. I hope that you will consider my suggestion.

<dd>Yeah, I&#39;m with Cameron. I think this is exactly the kind of commercial use of Wikipedia content we want to actively encourage. The only thing they get by feeding us money is cooperation from us for live feeds of new content, as opposed to reading it from old stale database dumps.

<dd>Donations will continue to make up the vast majority of WMF&#39;s revenue, this is simply an additional revenue stream. In fact, as part of our relationship with Orange, we hope we&#39;ll find opportunities to make people more aware of the fact that Wikimedia is a charity supported by donations (and that Wikipedia is an encyclopedia supported by volunteers). We&#39;ve had much smaller business partnerships before, such as the live feed we&#39;ve provided to answers.com, but now that we actually have some capacity to think strategically about these kinds of business relationships, we can develop them at a scale and in a way that makes sense.--<a href="" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 23:15, 1 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I would be very interested to see some more specific information about the consideration in this partnership, partly out of curiosity and partly as a way to judge the philosophical position of the Foundation on the issue of being paid for content use. There is, and has long been, tension between the ideal of the maximum free use of our content and the utility of additional revenue for the Foundation. Some would say that we should, as part of our overall goal, give unfettered content access to organizations (including for-profit corporations) while accepting only reimbursement for costs incurred in facilitating that access. Others would argue that if we are to allow profit-making organizations to use Wikimedia marks and content, some of that profit should redound to the Foundation. I&#39;m curious to know where the Foundation has officially come down on this issue. </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>If the idea is that the Foundation ought to receive revenue from content reuse but not content <i>use</i> (i.e. revenue from repackaging by other services, but not from our own direct service), I&#39;d be curious to know what control the Foundation has in this case over <i>how</i> the revenue is generated. If we were hosting our own ads, as an example, we would have complete control over the nature of our advertisements. With ads placed by Orange, in this instance, what is to say that someone viewing the <a href="" title="Fox News">Fox News</a> article through an Orange service won&#39;t see an embedded ad for <a href="" title="Bill O&#39;Reilly">Bill O&#39;Reilly</a>?

There are many specific trademark QA provisions in our relationship with Orange. In addition, we&#39;ll work with them to emphasize the charity status of Wikimedia, the fact that the projects require volunteer support, etc. That doesn&#39;t mean everything will necessarily work out perfectly, of course, but we&#39;ll do our best to support the process.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Ultimately the real value proposition from the point of view of the Wikimedia community is that, in addition to the fact that agreements like this help sustain WMF, a multinational multi-billion dollar company is throwing its weight behind making our content more widely known and used. Yes, those users could come straight to us, and indeed, the likeliest audience for the Orange properties are the people who aren&#39;t currently Wikimedia users, or the contexts where Wikimedia&#39;s penetration is still limited (e.g. mobile use). This is not an exclusive agreement, it won&#39;t affect the experience on Wikimedia itself, and it doesn&#39;t preclude us from improving the user experience for users going to Wikipedia.org itself from a mobile phone (e.g. improving our own <a class="externallink" href="http://m.wikipedia.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://m.wikipedia.org/">mobile portal</a>).--<a href="" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 22:07, 6 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>(unindent) Maybe it is something like how some web pages on one site are piped into &#34;frames&#34; on another domain. With the logos, icons, and everything of both sites and domains. </p>
<p>Otherwise, <a href="" title="Orange Telecom">Orange Telecom</a> could just pay for a daily data dump to their own servers or something. But that would require some investments in servers and staff, I would think. And especially an investment in time setting it all up. Piping it directly from Wikipedia servers probably requires much less in the way of skilled staff and setup time. Wikipedia already has the highly skilled server staff, and everything is already set up. </p>
<p><a href="" title="Answers.com">Answers.com</a> already had a lot of servers and staff, I believe. Do they get some kind of regular data dump from Wikipedia? Is that how they are doing it? </p>
<p>Is Orange Telecom basically wrapping Wikipedia-served pages into Orange Telecom pages on their own channels and devices? I guess since they are nonpolitical (I assume) this doesn&#39;t bother too many people. It doesn&#39;t bother me. </p>
<p>I don&#39;t see why we don&#39;t add some relatively safe, nonpolitical, noncontroversial, opt-out ads directly on Wikipedia pages served piping hot. :) ... and not just piped through places like Answers.com and Orange Telecom. </p>

<dd>yes, and no, but I suppose I should keep it on the bigger picture.    I do see this all the time myself.  The problem, I think, is function of limitations in self-expression: expressing a thought clearly is something that takes a lot of practice.  what I imagine happens (psychologically speaking) is that Editor A reads something that s/he finds unbalanced and decides to correct it by introducing a contrasting viewpoint.  all well and good to that point, but it starts to suffer because:
<ul>
<li>most people don&#39;t know how to integrate opposing viewpoints in a sophisticated way.  juxtapositional contrast is the easiest form, because it relies on the interpretive powers of others (put X next to Y and wave your hands suggestively, and in most cases other people will figure out what you mean), so that gets used a lot.</li>
<li>most people are aware of the <i>classes</i> of viewpoints in a given argument, but don&#39;t really have a good sense for the <i>interrelation</i> or <i>weight</i> of those classes.  so, Editor A knows that what s/he has read represents a particular viewpoint, and knows that there is another viewpoint out there that contrasts, and can even identify that other viewpoint.  but s/he doesn&#39;t have a good sense for who holds that viewpoint, or how the viewpoints developed with respect to each other, or where they locate in the universe of ideas.  and so you get more hand-waving via weasel words (&#39;some scholars say...&#39;, &#39;advocates hold...&#39;, &#39;it has been suggested that...&#39;, etc.) because the editor is trying to get the idea out there, and leaving it up to the rest of us to work out the details.</li>
<li>most people reason semi-emotionally, rather than intellectually, about topics that concern them.  it is more important to them to get a word in edgewise that defuses something they don&#39;t like than to make sure that the bigger picture is balanced and neutral.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>the best hope is that these issues will get played out on the talk page (where people with more practice at self-expression can help people with less practice figure out how to express things), but if you look at the page you cited, well... it&#39;s been around since 2006 but the talk page only has one archive, which either means that there hasn&#39;t been a lot of discussion about the article at all, or the discussion has all been in edit summaries on the main page.

<dd>I was thinking something along the lines of an essay/policy specifically reminding editors to avoid &#34;getting a word in edgewise&#34; and turning an article into a back-and-forth debate. Even if people do read MOS and the NPOV pages, it&#39;s helpful to have a WP: link that can be referred to instead of editors having to repeatedly synthesize a point out of all that text.

<p>In most instances, a scholarly organization will not allow students to cite Wikipedia articles, while they may or may not allow users to cite articles from other, less open, encyclopedias. </p>
<p>In my own personal experience, the most common complaint seems to be that &#34;anyone can edit it&#34;. </p>
<p>As no one can edit history pages, as they are backup pages, perhaps we can look to the history logs to solve this issue.</p>
<p>We can start by making the history easier to use and more readable, but more importantly, a new banner which would declare whether or not the edit was made because the article had spam or misinformation, and perhaps a quote of the reason for editing the article. <a href="" title="User:The8thbit">8bit</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:The8thbit">talk</a>) 01:00, 6 May 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, so long as we&#39;re discussing ways to make Wikipedia seem more reliable, the plugin which displays the quality rating of the article, and changes the color of the title accordingly could make Wikipedia seem more reliable if turned on by defualt, for all users with or without an account.

<dd>The problem is that even if you cite a specific revision of an article, you still don&#39;t know for sure whether all of the information in that revision is correct - you&#39;d have to check it all against another source. As for determining the reason an edit was made, we have what&#39;s called an <a href="" title="WP:Edit summary">edit summary</a> where you describe what you&#39;re editing in the article. Admittedly, edit summaries aren&#39;t always used and they can be quite brief. The plugin you&#39;re mentioning could be useful but it&#39;s not a good idea to rely on an article solely because it has a high assessment.

<dd>It is very rare for someone to say they are an admin in discussions, and I have never seen it in a signature. The reason is that it is not important in most discussions whether someone is an admin or not. And if it was important for some reason, the admin would choose to mention why. Using it in discussions on talk pages would imply an authority, which in theory at least, admins do not generally have. There is also a script <a href="" title="User:Ais523/adminrights.js">here</a> which can highlight who is an admin on talk pages, for those who are interested. -- <a href="" title="user:zzuuzz">zzuuzz</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="user_talk:zzuuzz">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 17:53, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>It&#39;s generally accepted here (I think) that admins shouldn&#39;t mention that they are admins unless its actually relevant <i>and</i> isn&#39;t obvious from context. Putting it in a signature would go against that. Of course, English WP admins <i>qua</i> admins are broadly considered &#34;janitors&#34;, not &#34;super editors&#34;, while the Spanish term bibliotecario (&#34;librarian&#34;) suggests editing authority. Maybe it&#39;s just a word, but that seems a quite different conceptualisation and if Spanish WP is happy to go with that, then flagging this status in the signature may be appropriate. Otherwise, maybe the name should be changed! <a href="" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:rd232">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 19:03, 3 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Actually the term librarian was chosen to avoid misunderstanding as sysop (system operator) or administrator (managing) implied authority, whereas a librarian just helps you find information.

<dd>Fine, but &#34;librarian&#34; sounds to me like it implies authority to do with knowledge, whereas &#34;admin&#34; doesn&#39;t imply authority (to me), or insofar as it does, it&#39;s in relation to technical matters.

<p>As an admin, I refuse to identify myself as such in my signature. I would rather present myself as just a person. That being said, I am sure a javascript applet could be made to identify the signatures of admins, I am fine with this. <a href="" title="User talk:Chillum">&#60;font color=&#34;Green&#34;&#62;<b>Chillum</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> 05:07, 5 May 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>(I&#39;m not an administrator.) Generally, administrators are meant to refrain from administrative actions on pages they&#39;ve edited. So when on the talk page of a page they&#39;re editing, administrative status should be irrelevant, while indicating it might be seen as &#34;pulling rank&#34; on newcomers and might provoke a few older editors who are averse to bureaucracy. In technical and policy discussions, an administrator usually has no more say than any other editor even though the administrator might at some point in the future have to implement or enforce any consensus that&#39;s reached. Administrators have often mentioned their status when recalling relevant experience or the way they&#39;ve reached decisions when they&#39;ve felt it relevant to the discussion. <a href="" title="User:Shakescene">—— Shakescene</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Shakescene">talk</a>) 09:16, 5 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I would change &#34;edited&#34; to &#34;interested party&#34;. An admin shouldn&#39;t have to refrain from taking administrative action on a page if he once reverted some vandalism there or corrected a typo. Same with discussions such as XFDs. He can still close it if his edits to the discussion are relistings or deletion sorting but he hasn&#39;t taken a position.

<p>Adminship, at least as advertised here at en.wikipedia, is supposed to not be a big deal. There is no reason to make it as such. Besides, admins are also editors just like anyone else, and they may not always be acting in admin capacity (the same applies to the other special types of users here, such as bureaucrats, CheckUsers, or even arbitrators). It goes against what some users (including myself) that adminship is not some special status or whatnot – it&#39;s just some extra tools. <a href="" title="User talk:MuZemike">MuZemike</a> 04:41, 6 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with MuZumike that being an Admin is not a big deal, but yet whenever I see a vote on a new admin there&#39;s always at least a few that <b>oppose</b> that seem to think that admins are a big deal. Plus has anyone ever tried to get an admin removed from being an admin for violating policy or bad behavior or misuse of the tools? If admin was just a bunch of tools that werent a big deal, then it shouldnt be so hard to remove them, but alas it is 100 times harder to lose your adminship than to gain it from what I have seen. I agree that it is nothing more than a bunch of tools, but I also agree that since their function is like a janitor here on en.wikipedia that their name should be changed TO <b>janitor</b>, administrator sounds like they are an administrator of rules, which wikipedia does not have &#34;RULES&#34;, and gives newbies the wrong impression. Where in our lives do we first encounter the word administrator? In school and in college where that word is used for people IN CHARGE who make the rules and enforce them.<a href="" title="User:Camelbinky">Camelbinky</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Camelbinky">talk</a>) 20:28, 10 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Policy_as_a_whole">Policy as a whole</span></h2>

<p>I would like to propose that Wikipedia looks at the policies it has in place, as a whole, and begins a system of reform. In my opinion, there is too much in the way of regulation and unneccesary policy here, that could be cut back. The policy of retaining pages for historical purposes is one such policy I have called for discussion on, since not all subpages are really needed.

<p>I don&#39;t have an axe to grind or a dog in this hunt, but as a newcomer am just curious about something: Let&#39;s say there&#39;s a <a href="" title="WP:FA?">FA</a>, <a href="" title="WP:FL?">FL</a>, or <a href="" title="WP:GA?">GA</a> article and someone attempts to add something which, though it adds relevant, useful, and appropriate content to the article, is of lesser quality and could cause the article to drop down to a lower quality status ranking. Can an article be <a href="" title="WP:OWN">&#34;owned&#34;</a> to the extent needed to justify deleting that content so as to revert it to a particular quality level even if the reversion removes useful and appropriate information which would be acceptable in a lower-ranked article? Or does this question just raise a silly impossibility? (Full disclosure: I&#39;ve asked basically this same question on <a href="" title="User talk:Mendaliv">Mendaliv&#39;s talk page</a>, but while waiting for his answer [and with <i>absolutely</i> no offense intended to his expertise], I&#39;d like to hear what others think, too.) <a href="" title="User:TransporterMan">TransporterMan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TransporterMan">talk</a>) 20:14, 7 May 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>How could an edit which adds properly sourced material &#34;cause the article to drop down to a lower quality status ranking&#34;? The people who rank articles do have some discretion and I don&#39;t believe they would lower an article&#39;s ranking on account of such an addition. In the event such an event came up, I believe editing the new material, so as to increase its quality, would be the proper course of action. <a href="" title="User:SMP0328.">SMP0328.</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:SMP0328.">talk</a>) 22:30, 7 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>It&#39;s easy to imagine (and I have seen it happen) a top-quality article having a big chunk of material added, which is relevant and verifiable, even though it is badly sourced, badly written, disorganized, and partly overlapping with other parts of the article.&#60;br&#62;
I would suggest that rather than just deleting such an addition, you should move it to talk space, write a note (in the edit summary and a talk comment) explaining where it was moved and why, and try to cooperate with the originator in gradually working it back into the article.&#60;br&#62;
Or maybe leave it in the article, and adorn that section with one of those <a href="#Tag_consolidation" title="Wikipedia:Template messages/Cleanup">templates like <i>&#60;nowiki&#62; &#60;/nowiki&#62;</i></a>&#38;nbsp; while it is being worked on. --<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/83.253.250.70">83.253.250.70</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:83.253.250.70">talk</a>) 14:39, 10 May 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>There is an existing policy, found at <a href="#Heritage" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)</a>.  Earlier in the history of Wikipedia, we spent over 6 months hammering out a clear and concise policy. It was ignored by random editors that don&#39;t bother to read and understand policy. Over 2 more years at <a href="" title="WP:CfD">WP:CfD</a>, a better compromise form was adopted after much discussion (and I was not involved).</p>
<p><b>Fooian Barians</b> has been replaced by <i>&#34;<b>Fooian</b> people of <b>Barian</b> descent&#34;</i> for clarity.</p>
<p>The older policy wasn&#39;t easily workable and readily apparent in practice. Folks had difficulty distinguishing adjectival usage. Many names simply are unworkable in either <i>Fooian Barians</i> or <i>Fooian-Barians</i> forms (such as, &#34;Puerto Rican&#34;, &#34;Dominican Republic&#34;, &#34;Saint Vincent and the Grenadines&#34;).</p>
<p>The updated policy prevents arguments, and long, slow motion, edit wars using   between hyphenated and unhyphenated forms. All to the good!</p>
<p>Over time and much discussion, all of the subcategories of <a href="" title="Category:People by ethnic or national descent">Category:People by ethnic or national descent</a> have been updated to this new form. All of the subcategories of most nationalities have been updated to this new form. For example,
</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="" title="Category:People of British descent">Category:People of British descent</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Category:British people by ethnic or national origin">Category:British people by ethnic or national origin</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Category:People of Canadian descent">Category:People of Canadian descent</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Category:Canadian people by ethnic or national origin">Category:Canadian people by ethnic or national origin</a></li></ol>

<p>Some American subcategories have been updated.  For example, <a href="#Category:Polish-Americans" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2008 June 29">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2008 June 29</a>. Now, there are some editors (having lost the previous debate) that want to change back at <a href="#Category:Americans_of_Polish_descent" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2009 May 3">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2009 May 3</a>.</p>
<p>See also <a href="#Category:Turkish_Americans" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2009 May 2">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2009 May 2</a>, where an editor surreptitiously used category redirect to reverse repeated CfD decisions at:

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Dispute_tags">Dispute tags</span></h2>

<p>Is it maybe time to discontinue the use of &#34;disputed&#34; tags on policy and guideline pages? My experience is that people who are making genuine, constructive efforts to reach consensus to change policies or guidelines almost <i>never</i> use these tags. The tags are generally used by those with a personal axe to grind, and serve mainly to discredit some text that those editors don&#39;t like. If the tags could be used as described in <a href="#Proposing_change_to_guideline_or_policy_status" title="WP:POLICY">WP:POLICY</a>, i.e. when there&#39;s a genuine concern that a page or section has just been made into a policy/guideline without consensus, and if such disputes were quickly settled, then that would be fine. But there seems little point allowing people to decorate policies with tags that appear to say &#34;you don&#39;t necessarily want to take any notice of this&#34;, but in fact mean nothing more than &#34;there&#39;s something here that at least one person wants to change&#34;.--<a href="" title="User:Kotniski">Kotniski</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kotniski">talk</a>) 10:00, 9 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Right. Perhaps there should be a BRD-like principle that once such a tag is removed, it can only be restored by consensus, or by an admin or similarly neutral user on the basis of arguments showing that there really is a substantial dispute?--<a href="" title="User:Kotniski">Kotniski</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kotniski">talk</a>) 08:45, 12 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>The existing policy linked above already uses clear, explicit language to cover this: &#34;If you have grounds to claim that a section was recently added or substantially altered in breach of the proper procedures for establishing consensus, then you may use   instead.&#34;
Preventing the &#60;tt&#62;disputedtag&#60;/tt&#62; from being re-added once anybody removes it, unless solid consensus can be demonstrated that parties agree a dispute <i>exists</i>, whereupon it may be re-added so the underlying dispute (not the dispute that there is a dispute) can continue, seems unlikely to work well in practice.&#38;nbsp;–<a href="" title="User talk:Whitehorse1">Whitehorse1</a> 09:14, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Well, our experiences will obviously have differed (and ironically I <i>have</i> placed one myself), but in almost all the cases I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s been one person trying to get attention to their personal grievance, leading to edit wars with others trying to enforce the policy which you quote.--<a href="" title="User:Kotniski">Kotniski</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kotniski">talk</a>) 10:41, 12 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>The tags are fine, the people removing them need to use more care rather than just blindly assuming they have support from the community. It&#39;s always driven me nuts how a small handful of editors can declare no dispute exists when obviously at least one person thinks something is wrong and needs to be discussed. —<a href="" title="User:Locke Cole">Locke Cole</a> • <a href="" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 10:47, 12 May 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Well, on the other hand, why should that &#34;one person&#34; be allowed to unilaterally declare that there is a dispute of such magnitude that it is worthy of advertisement on the page? In many cases that person doesn&#39;t even state clearly what the dispute is about, and doesn&#39;t even set the template parameters that indicate where the discussion is taking place (often because there isn&#39;t one). There is, of course, the   template and similar, which are generally far more suitable.--<a href="" title="User:Kotniski">Kotniski</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kotniski">talk</a>) 11:41, 12 May 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It&#39;s often not unilateral, although it may appear that way. These templates are a companion to the BRD cycle; they can be used when a change has been made, but no consensus can be reached on whether to keep or reject the changes. As for the lack of a discussion section on talk (and link in the template), that should be easy to resolve by using #if to require a section be specified for the template to operate. But it&#39;s a sad state of affairs indeed when there&#39;s a dispute over whether there&#39;s a dispute... —<a href="" title="User:Locke Cole">Locke Cole</a> • <a href="" title="User talk:Locke Cole">t</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Locke Cole">c</a> 12:29, 12 May 2009 (UTC)

<li>My opinion: In a reference, an external link should only be used when it allows the reader to actually view the reference. A link to Amazon doesn&#39;t do that, unless they have a thing like Google Books. Same goes for links to any other online bookseller, or to the author&#39;s or publisher&#39;s website for that matter: if you can&#39;t read the book online there, it&#39;s just linkspam. You even have to be careful with Google Books links, it seems too often I click the link only to have Google Books tell me &#34;you have reached your viewing limit&#34; &#60;small&#62;(WTF? This is the first time I looked!)&#60;/small&#62;.&#60;br /&#62;This is not to be confused with the External links section of the article about the book, where a link to the author&#39;s or publisher&#39;s website might be appropriate. <a href="" title="User:Anomie">Anomie</a><a href="" title="User talk:Anomie">⚔</a> 11:07, 14 May 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Interesting timing, as just yesterday I added a link to Amazon. I was editing the <a href="" title="Ed Viesturs">Ed Viesturs</a> article, because it had the notice asking fro more citations. One of the unsourced claims was that he had written a book. The Amazon link supports the claim that he did, indeed write the book. I thought about whether to use the <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/">ISBN c</a>ite (thought very briefly, I&#39;ll hasten to ask) and decided that if the claim referred to the content of the book, then a reference to the book would be warranted, but the claim was simply that he was an author of a book, so I felt the easier path was sufficient. My reasoning is, admittedly, weak, so if the consensus is that I should use the <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/">ISBN l</a>ink, I&#39;ll make the change, but I am interested to hear whether my distinction makes any sense to anyone else.<a href="" title="User:Sphilbrick">Sphilbrick</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Sphilbrick">talk</a>) 13:32, 14 May 2009 (UTC) After reading more of the discussion, I decided to change the link to an <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/">ISBN l</a>ink. <a href="" title="User:Sphilbrick">Sphilbrick</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Sphilbrick">talk</a>) 14:01, 14 May 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>We absolutely do not link to individual booksellers in references. Putting a link to an Amazon page just favors that commerical entity over all other commercial entities who also sell it. The <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/">ISBN c</a>ode allows people to find multiple ways to get at the book, including library links.

In addition to inappropriately favoring one seller over another, this is a worldwide encyclopedia, not a country-specific one.

</p><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Proposal_for_standardizing_warning_templates">Proposal for standardizing warning templates</span></h2>

<p>I propose that warning templates only approved on one page (or through the wikiproject on warning templates), approved through consensus be used and that we discourage the use of warning templates constructed by individual users on their own and not discussed and &#34;adopted&#34; as &#34;official&#34;. I believe it is potentially harmful for users to change the templates and potentially, I&#39;m sure in good faith, change the language subtly that may perhaps be more offensive or taken the wrong way. Only through consensus here can we be sure templates are being stated with the appropriate harshness/sensitivity. I think creating new ones in sandboxes and user pages are good, but the actual use and implementation of those new ones without first bringing them to be discussed and agreed upon by the community is dangerous. I bring this up due to a comment on the talk page of the wikiproject on warning templates of the editor who created warning templates and has had good results using them, yes he may have had what he believed to be good results, but what about the many other users who make their own and end up alienating newbies and established users alike. Perhaps treating new warning templates like drug companies treat new drugs would be a good way to find new ones. Let people create and improvise but then bring them to a central place and let the community as a whole decide whether or not they should be used on a &#34;trial basis&#34; and then after an arbitrary time of use that editor (and others who want to use the trial warning template) comes back there with the results and the community decides whether or not to keep the new template. There have been other suggestions on how to regulate warning templates on the wikiproject talk page, where I first brought my proposal about a 6 days ago. Most editors there (which consists obviously of people who are interested in warning templates in the first place) seem to agree that something is needed to standardize and regulate warning templates, but seem to be afraid that the community at large may be against a new level of bureaucracy or the wikiproject taking too much responsibility. I argue that we already let the wikiproject on stub templates regulate, decide what stubs are acceptable, and what the standardization of them; warning templates are much much more likely to be both intentionally and unintentionally used wrongly and/or abused. Even changing but just one word on a warning template could potentially change its meaning from well intentioned warning to violating wp:BITE. After 5 days I&#39;ll revist and see what everyone has to say, any questions for me needing answer before then, contact me on my talk page.

<dd>It may not be helpful, but it is relevant. Your proposal is far too wordy; it&#39;s like an incipient essay. This would be better: &#60;blockquote&#62;User warning templates are generally rather official-looking communications that appear to have a certain stamp of authority, especially to new users.

I therefore propose that new user warning templates (that is, templates which look as official as the <a href="" title="Category:Standardised user warning templates">current uw- templates</a>; templating clearly personal messages is excluded) should be discussed with the community before being used.

<li>I am absolutely against a new layer of administration, especially one that attempts to systematically force recent changes patrollers to adhere to arbitrary bureaucratic standards. RCPers can write whatever they want to a user&#39;s talk page as a warning. They can do this by hand every time if they wanted to. If they use their own templates to make this faster, so much the better. Now, if you object to the content of these warnings, you should object to what the user said, <i>not</i> the fact that they communicated it with a template. Would you intend to also ban writing warnings by hand in every case, thus forcing every warning into a restricted list of generic boilerplate messages? If someone&#39;s userfied templates are too &#34;BITE-ey&#34; or otherwise problematic, bring it up with the individual users on a case by case basis and use common sense. It is not necessary, nor is it acceptable, to think that we should make RCP any more difficult or complex than it already is. --<a href="" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;b&#62;talk&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 10:54, 16 May 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>The <a href="" title="WP:CSD">Criteria for Speedy Deletion</a> policy’s A7 category is currently used for deleting clearly non notable <b>real persons, organizations and Web content</b>. Technically taken pages can only be tagged if they fall under the previous three categories – If they don’t, they should be <a href="" title="WP:PROD">prodded</a> or taken to <a href="" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a>.</p>
<p>The problem with this definition is that other blatant non notable articles do not technically fall under this guideline. Articles about pets, furniture or products must therefore be tagged with CSD or PROD templates to be removed.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="The_problem_of_CSD_and_PROD_templates">The problem of CSD and PROD templates</span></h4>

<p>It seems to go against <a href="" title="WP:UCS">common sense</a> that we can remove people, organisations and web content as not notable without discussion, while subjects such as pets, Which are almost never notable, have to go trough a lengthy process. </p>
<p>PROD and AFD themselves have problems in their own right. Starting an AFD means that users will have to spend time commenting on them to determine if an article should be removed. In case of a pet this is a dull and time wasting task as there is truly no chance of a favourable outcome. In other words, it is a waste of editor time.</p>
<p>PROD templates have the difficulty that they may be removed – by any user – after which they may not be replaced. Since a PROD template has a standard duration of 7 days an article tagged with them must be checked back after that time elapsed, and tagged for AFD should the template be removed (in case of disagreement with the removal). As of such it is possible for articles that should clearly be removed to stick around. </p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Current_Situation">Current Situation</span></h4>

<p>Currently these articles are handled in two ways: Either they are simply tagged for CSD and an admin removes them trough applying the <a href="" title="WP:SNOW">snowball clause</a>, or they have to go trough the long route if the admin follows the guidelines exactly. There is no certainty that two admins will handle an identical tagged with A7 the same way. As of such I witnessed some editors make it a habit to tag these articles under a not so relevant category just to evade the A7 issue.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Summary_and_proposition">Summary and proposition</span></h4>

<p>Extend the A7 category to include <i>blatant</i> cases of non notable articles. This would be articles that have no chance to survive an <a href="" title="WP:AFD">WP:AFD</a> regardless of the people who voted. Currently protected categories such as Software, Books and schools could never fall under this extension unless the article itself claims otherwise (EG: “Hi World2 is an application I wrote during school yesterday!!”) . This would not truly change the currect process – but it would rather formalize a procedure used in practice. <a href="" title="User:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;191970&#34;&#62;<b>Excirial</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; (<a href="" title="User talk:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contact me&#60;/font&#62;</a>,<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 19:30, 15 May 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>&#60;s&#62;<b>Oppose</b>&#60;/s&#62; Yes, it is indeed strange that we can speedy obviously non-notabe persons or bands but not pets. The reason that is the case is that the CSD policy page is taken to be a bureaucratic rulebook, to which we must slavishly adhere to every dot and iota.  Since people think that they need policy to authorize every obviously good thing they do, or that if they are challenged they will need to cite policy to justify their actions (rather than a common sense ground that what they did was good for the project of building the encyclopedia), they feel like they have to list every possible item that might need to be speedied (persons, bands, pets, plants, cars, screwdrivers...) and pack it into the policy. There is no other policy on Wikipedia that does more to create the false impression that it is a bureaucratic firm rule, and I would be in favor of any revision to the policy that reversed this trend, rather than made it worse. --<a href="" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;b&#62;talk&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 20:18, 15 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd><b>Very well said</b> - perhaps i should start writing an essay about this behavior over CSD bureaucra(c/z)y. However, the proposal was to remove (and NOT add) limitations on the article categories the CSD template can be user for. So instead of &#34;a real person, an organization, bands, pets, plants, cars, screwdrivers ect etc&#34; and i don&#39;t know what else it would be valid for every type of article, as long as there is a blatant lack of notability. Those blatant cases are often being swiped under other categories or deleted trough PROD&#39;s and AFD&#39;s anyway. If we trust an admin can make valid decisions over the currently allowed categories, we must trust their decisions on other categories as well.   <a href="" title="User:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;191970&#34;&#62;<b>Excirial</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; (<a href="" title="User talk:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contact me&#60;/font&#62;</a>,<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 20:45, 15 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;m not really sure what the best way to handle it is. If I had my druthers I would rewrite the policy from scratch, but I know that would be way too radical for most people to handle. I recognize that your change gives administrators more leeway; I think the reason I am/was opposing it is that I object to the tacit assumption that administrators can&#39;t do the right thing unless the policy authorizes it. Judging by most of what goes on at <a href="" title="Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion">Wikipedia talk:Criteria for speedy deletion</a>, it seems most people editing this policy (and handling CSD nominations) have forgotten that entirely. I&#39;m glad that you and I agree that this is a fallacy, so maybe it would be best for me to pursue this crusade of mine somewhere else. On other policy pages I have simply used the <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Bold, revert, discuss">Wikipedia:Bold, revert, discuss</a> system to great effect, but I worry that CSD is so intensely bureaucratic in nature that it may be intractable without starting over. We&#39;ll see where it goes; in the mean time, I&#39;ll withdraw my objection to your proposal. --<a href="" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;b&#62;talk&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 00:14, 16 May 2009 (UTC)  </dd></dl></dd></dl></li>
<li>I disagree. There are unfortunately people over at CSD who are trigger happy nominating things for deletion without even giving people a chance to finish writing articles. Therefore CSD is deliberately written to cover only the obvious cases where articles should be deleted without discussion. Having said that, I&#39;d support extending A7 as proposed to cover all subjects which make no assertion of notability. I&#39;d question whether the debate should be here or over at the CSD page. <a href="" title="User:AndrewRT">AndrewRT</a>(<a href="" title="User talk:AndrewRT">Talk</a>) 22:08, 15 May 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The ones selected were selected on the basis that any two people could safely tell that there was no possible notability, and usually that does work fairly well. For other type of things its really much harder, and there is no way to write this to keep it from getting extended. People often write really bad articles on notable books for example, &#38; it won&#39;t be spotted unless someone recognizes it, which will happen in Prod, but not CSD. We need to cut down the opportunities for making mistakes. In an ideal world, no admin would delete without a full search for notability in all likely sources, but that doesn&#39;t happen here. The ones listed are those which are safe to go by appearances, because by and large, that is what happens. &#34;blatantly&#34; means nobody will disagree in good faith, but there is no way to tell that without seeing if they do. (anyone writing about their cat usually has the article deleted as a test page or vandalism--or as no context because there&#39;s no way to tell just what cat it is; if an article about a computer program says no more that what was above, it&#39;s likely to get deleted as no context as well.).<b><a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> (<a href="" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a>) 23:31, 15 May 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>
<p>&#60;s&#62;<b>Strong Oppose, this idea is lame.</b>  Speedy Deletion is overused anyway.  Why give these summary deletionists any more leeway.  The CSD policies are written to prohibit the summary deletion of many types of articles.  If the writers of the policy intended for speedy deletion be applied to pets, they would have expressed so in the policy.  Furthermore, I see not the &#34;waste of time&#34; the misguided original poster spoke of, as all discussion is <i>voluntary,</i> not forced like jury duty.

<p><b>Comment</b> The problem with the A7 policy is that we seem to have forgotten what the core reasoning for creating such a policy was. The core reason is that we should be able to remove articles that would clearly never meet any keep consensus when taken to <a href="" title="WP:AFD">Afd</a>. Instead we hammered the policy into some form of ugly compromise between deletionist and inclusionist stances; We allow removal tags the majority of the articles for removal without discussion, not based on quality of the article, but rather on the type of article. In a sense A7 is currently used to remove might be notable pages on people and companies, while disallowing tagging clearly non notable subjects due to the wording of the policy. Thus: the policy itself has become the reason for the policy, rather then common sense.</p>
<p>My personal opinion is that the policy should be altered to reflect the reason behind the policy. Perhaps the change i suggested is not the correct way to achieve this, but as its said: there is more then one road to Rome.  The problem  lies in the way the policy is executed, which we subsequently tried to prevent by limiting the scope of the policy. Thus, we tried telling ourself that allowing people to remove a smaller subset of possibly notable articles would remove the problem, as long as we counterbalance it with disallowing it on other subject area. As for removing clear notability issues in those non allowed categories we also found a solution - either go trough a long process of discussion better saved for possibly notable articles in the categories we allow, or we just throw it as glass in a container meant for paper. Should it really work that way? No. But it is probably better to solve this structurally then trough applying damage control.  <a href="" title="User:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;191970&#34;&#62;<b>Excirial</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; (<a href="" title="User talk:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contact me&#60;/font&#62;</a>,<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 09:00, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I have to admit that what you&#39;ve said makes a great deal of sense to me, and I find myself in absolute agreement with everything you wrote. It sounds like you may be tending to agree with my suspicion that what is needed at CSD is a more radical overhaul of the policy than merely tinkering with the wording. Since the current policy is evidently a frankenstein of compromises over literal and bureacratic interpretation of syntax that has grown more bloated over time with every tiny debate leading to a new clause, a new category, and a new compromise... we need to cut the head off this dragon. I thought I was the only one who felt this way, but now I am starting to suspect that others have been frustrated with the ludicrous complexity of the CSD policy, but nobody ever did anything about it because it was too much of a hassle and seemed to represent &#34;consensus.&#34; I may begin to make <a href="" title="WP:BOLD">bold changes</a> to the policy in order to <a href="" title="WP:BRD">stimulate discussion</a> since I have found this to be a successful means for re-drafting policies that had become overly complex. If this sounds like a good idea to you, I suggest we move this to the CSD page itself, and I would be grateful for any input or assistance you could offer on this. --<a href="" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;b&#62;talk&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 10:41, 16 May 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>I would strongly recommend not making bold changes to fundamental policy. To quote from the BOLD guideline:  &#34;Although it is acceptable to be bold in updating articles, it is easier to cause problems in other namespaces by editing without due care. The admonition &#34;but do not be reckless&#34; is especially important in other namespaces.&#34; and &#34;Often it is easier to see that something is not right rather than to know exactly what would be right.&#34; As for the current rules, i see them as a series of adjustments to meet problems and achieve balance. They are not perfect, but the real problem isn&#39;t the rules, but the failure of admins to follow them, and the various barriers to dealing with that--some unavoidable, such as  the need for us admins to be polite to each other. <b><a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> (<a href="" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a>) 04:35, 17 May 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As for the bold edits I intend to make, I can assure you that I don&#39;t intend to be reckless; the objective is to stimulate discussion by making a bold edit and then seeing who reverts and on what grounds. See <a href="" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a> for an explanation of the logic behind this. I appreciate that you don&#39;t want radical overhauls of policy to occur too quickly, and so I would suggest that if you disagree with any of my policy edits, you should revert them, and then we can discuss the details on the talk page. As for the problem with rules, the problem with the rules is not that people aren&#39;t following them, but that there are too many of them. If people aren&#39;t following the rules then that should indicate to you that the rules are too complicated and are getting in the way of building the encyclopedia. It is incomprehensible that admins &#34;failing&#34; to &#34;follow the rules&#34; could be a problem. Any admin who &#34;fails&#34; to obey rules is probably doing the project a service by concentrating on what matters -- building the encyclopedia -- instead of focusing on stifling bureaucratic policy wonkery.  --<a href="" title="User:Ryan Delaney">Ryan Delaney</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Ryan Delaney">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;b&#62;talk&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 05:20, 17 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I think part of the problem is that there isn&#39;t much overlap between the people discussing and controlling the development of the policy and the people actually implementing it. The people writing the policy assume that the people applying it will automatically shift their behavior at every single change but the people using the policy aren&#39;t following the continuous discussions and wording changes, they&#39;re going by memory and whatever short notes the tools they use give. This all goes back to the idea that policy isn&#39;t proscriptive. The new page patrollers are using the CSD policy like any other policy; they follow the general spirit and do what works for themselves and everyone else and they don&#39;t use the exact wording of the policy to guide their every action. The difference with this policy though, is that the people writing it expect them to follow the exact wording rather than the spirit. &#60;font face=&#34;Broadway&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.</a><a href="" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man"><b><i>Z-</i></b><i>man</i></a>&#60;/font&#62; 05:42, 17 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Two_New_Ideas">Two New Ideas</span></h2>

<p> 
 
1) In order to save wikipedia server space and user resources, we should streamline the article deletion process.  We should require that a user that seeks an AFD must have at least tried to get the article deleted through the &#34;PROD&#34; procedure as a necessary condition precedent.  That will lessen the workload at AFD since many of the articles that would have gone through a full 7 day AFD under the old system will be deleted.  If any user attempt an AFD without fufilling the condition precedent of listing the article as a PROD, then his AFD will be stricken, without prejudice, for failure to perform a necessary condition precedent.</p>
<p>2) Wikipedia needs money.  The commission can sell advertising OR raise money through auctions, donations, and charity contests like it does now.  However, since the &#34;rollback&#34; function became more of use to the non admin classes an idea arises how to make money and democratise wikipedia in one fell swoop?  One proposal is to auction or sell admin, steward, and sysop rights to the highest bidder.  Another intelligent proposal is to not sell the access level as a package, but sell different individual privileges (summary deletion, rollback, checkuser, etc) a la carte at set prices.  I am sure people would be willing to pay well over a thousand dollars for admin rights on english wikipedia.  The checkuser privilege may fetch a pretty penney as well.  In this way we can keep wikipedia free of advertising and other evils. <a href="" title="User:Yardleyman">Yardleyman</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Yardleyman">talk</a>) 02:29, 16 May 2009 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd><b>Nonsense.</b> Server load would not be reduced by forcing a PROD over an AFD. Prod templates can be legally removed by anyone and don&#39;t come in to effect until 7 days after it is placed. As of such the person placing it would need to check his tagged articles to see if the PROD template has been removed - not only is this an annoyance to track, but it also requires server load to check such a page. If the prod IS removed we still need to go trough the entire AFD proces. Besides, what if we striked an AFD? Should it simply go trough the proces i previously mentioned just to end back at an AFD? Besides, PROD templates are meant for pages that don&#39;t fall under CSD guidelines, but won&#39;t need discussion for removal (Such as the guidelines is <a href="" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>). AFD&#39;s are for creating community consensus over a page; Therefore, not every page can or should be prodded first. </dd></dl>

<p>Being a long-term contributor of Wikipedia, I just have come to realization that Wikipedia is simply an aggregator. It does not create new information. In a sense, it is akin to Yahoo or MSN or other even pre-Internet aggregators that enlist resources on different subjects. These aggregators are no more relevant because you can Google anything, does Wikipedia still relevant? And if it does, can it sustain without the resources it relies upon? What if the website with a resource is taken down? Several sites? Many of them? The information becomes unverifiable. I think Wikipedia should reconsider its stance on original research and allow more of it, and less of dependency on external sites. As of now, Wikipedia does not increase the amount of knowledge, it only provides a convenient access to it. <a href="" title="User:Mikus">Mikus</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mikus">talk</a>) 21:01, 13 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>If the problem is that online sources for verifying articles disappear over time, the solution is not to lessen requirements that articles are verified by external sources.  Ideally, articles should cite to more than just links to external websites, such as books or print periodicals.  Cites to external websites should at least give the date and title of such links so we can know what the URL once referred to (which will hopefully have a print version, in the case of cites to newspaper websites).  Otherwise, your observations about Wikipedia being a secondary source, and not a generator of knowledge, are largely accurate&#38;mdash;Wikipedia compiles, centralizes, and organizes information that has already been published elsewhere.  <a href="" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Postdlf">talk</a>) 21:13, 13 May 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I would like to point out that at the start of the height of his career <a href="" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a> was asked to contribute to an encyclopedia an article on his newest breakthroughs on quanta, relativity and such, BEFORE they were proven correct. If Wikipedia had existed a little less than 100 years ago (this sometime before between 1900 and 1920) and Einstien had attempted to contribute to an article on these discoveries, Wikipedians would have shouted him out with &#34;original research&#34; and &#34;conflict of interest&#34;. Encyclopedia articles, especially in the more respected ones, are written by experts who often use their own original research. I think we all need to understand that. If original research is CORRECT and published research is wrong, then the published research should be removed as FALSE info, even if we shouldnt put the original research in because of our policies. <b>TRUTH</b> above <b>references</b>.<a href="" title="User:Camelbinky">Camelbinky</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Camelbinky">talk</a>) 01:08, 16 May 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your example fails to recognize the difference in the trust models employed by traditional encyclopedia&#39;s and Wikipedia.  There is no practical means available on Wikipedia to verify the identity and expertise of our many contributors.  As a result we do not rely upon individual expertise to form a basis for determining the &#34;TRUTH&#34;.  In a traditional encyclopedia the publisher controls who is allowed to contribute and to which entries each individual is associated.  This allows a traditional encyclopedia to verify individual areas of expertise and utilize the personal knowledge of experts in a variety of fields.  Contributions to Wikipedia however lack this control.  Instead a wide variety of individuals with no verifiable expertise and potential conflicts of interest are allowed to anonymously contribute to any article they desire.  Because of this difference, Wikipedia relies upon previously published sources to perform the data screening and fact checking functions.  --<i><a href="" title="User: Allen3">Allen3</a></i>&#38;nbsp;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Allen3">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 01:38, 16 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>If you want to get your original research in Wikipedia, get it published first so that an organization that has the means to do so can verify that you&#39;re not just making stuff up and so that the actual methods behind your research can be published somewhere (all Wikipedia cares about are the conclusions). If your methods are sound, your results repeatable, and you really can prove an established theory wrong, I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have no trouble getting published. Wikipedia though does not have the resources to do all the necessary verification, which is why we rely on publishers who do. &#60;font face=&#34;Broadway&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.</a><a href="" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man"><b><i>Z-</i></b><i>man</i></a>&#60;/font&#62; 01:59, 16 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>You downgrade Wikipedia to a mere aggregator of information, basically to a consumer of someone else&#39;s efforts to verify/publish/confirm the statements. I for one don&#39;t want just to dig through someone else&#39;s stuff all over the Net just to aggregate it. I have some information of my own that I can contribute. This information is not a relativity theory or a nuclear research, this is small stuff that is absolutely of no interest to any magazine or paper, these are just bits and pieces of information that I happen to know, and I happen to be able to verify. Here is case in point: Panasonic has released a new digital camcorder, the TM300, which can record in 24 frame/s progressive mode. Question arises: is this native progressive mode or done through 2-3 pulldown process? Different -- and very few so far -- sources on the Net give different info on this account. Whom to believe? I went to a store myself yesterday and checked the camcorder. I found out myself -- yes, this is original research -- that it uses 2-3 pulldown. I can prove it, I can provide raw files and screenshots from my editing program. Now what? You want me to write a blog entry on the subject and then link Wiki article to it? Lame. So why cannot I simply edit the relevant arcticle in Wikipedia and put this info in: this camcorder records in this particular mode, period. If someone else will be able to disprove it, fine, change the entry. But this will be unlikely as more and more people will verify my statement themselves.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

In the case above, one does not even have to buy the camcorder, one can go to a store and play with it for two minutes, then bring the memory card home and analyze the files. Easily verifiable original research should be allowed. Also, Wikipedia has policy on commonly accepted knowledge. Here, something that started as original research, can quickly become common knowledge as more and more people verify it.<a href="" title="User:Mikus">Mikus</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mikus">talk</a>) 17:49, 19 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>The point I was trying to make is that if info has been published somewhere but if it is blatantly FALSE then it should be removed regardless of if no source refutes it. I&#39;m sure we can find sources that call Washington, DC a town, but we dont then go around saying it is a town and a city; it is a city period and ignore (using common sense) the fact that there is a colloquial use of the word &#34;town&#34; versus a political technical definition (in many states) of town or township (or civil township). <a href="" title="North River Steamboat">North River Steamboat</a> is a case in point, even though a VAST majority of RELIABLE sources say the boat&#39;s name was the Clermont, but the truth of the matter is that the boat had no name at first and was originally referred to in its advertisements as the North River Steamboat (because it was THE only steamboat and it was on the North River/Hudson River). All the reliable sources can be traced back to one source which was considered THE authoritative work on the subject and it got it wrong and that wrong info was carried through time. At least that is what the article says, I take it with a grain of salt and havent had the time to check out the references further. If the article is <b>correct</b> then the &#34;Original Research&#34; of actually looking at ads for the steamboat from that period show that the name of the boat was NOT the Clermont originally then it doesnt matter if you have 3,000,000 sources saying that the Clermont was the original name because primary sources show it wasnt.<a href="" title="User:Camelbinky">Camelbinky</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Camelbinky">talk</a>) 19:42, 19 May 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Actually, looking at the ads of the time is not original research.  You are still proving a fact using a published, verifiable source.  And that, of course, is the opposite of Mikus&#39; example above, where the issue also does not revolve around original research, but rather, verifiability.  In his case, the information likely exists in a technical reference for the product, but unless that can be produced, we can only go on an individual&#39;s say so.  I think your example here proves out why we MUST insist on referencing to reliable sources.  There are a lot of people who reuse our content, and if we allow a falsehood to stand because an editor &#34;verified it in person&#34;, then we run the risk of propogating that falsehood into the real world, where invariably it gets picked up somewhere by someone who didn&#39;t do their own fact checking.  Suddenly, this false statement made on Wikipedia has a source in an otherwise reliable publication, and Wikipedia has suddenly reinvented the truth.  <a href="" title="User:Resolute">Reso</a><a href="" title="User Talk:Resolute">lute</a> 03:26, 20 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>No, an unpublished work centuries old would be in the public domain; publishing it after its copyright lapses doesn&#39;t change that.

Anyway, the OP is asking an academic question because it&#39;s public domain either way.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id=".26quot.3BProleptic_calendars.3F.26quot.3B">&#34;Proleptic calendars?&#34;</span></h2>

<p>I feel that a &#34;conceptual&#34; mistake concerns the Islamic years in en.wiki: before 622 the <a href="" title="Template:Year in other calendars">Template:Year in other calendars</a> shows a digit followed by BH (I suppose &#34;Before <a href="" title="Hijra">Hijra</a>&#34;). But as far as I know, in the Islamic world there does not exist anything like the Christian &#34;BC&#34;. Even in historical texts written by muslims I only find dates according to the Common Era, but never &#34;Before Hijra&#34;. For Muslims, the time before Hijra is <i><a href="" title="jahiliyyah">jahiliyyah</a></i> (&#34;ignorance [of the revelation]&#34;), and it has no sense to speak of such times in a historical way. So, I feel that for every year preceding 622 this template should not calculate negative dates, but simply show one and the same word <i>jahiliyyah</i>.&#60;br /&#62;Moreover, I see that this template calculates years in the &#34;Islamic&#34; way (<i>i.e.</i> shorter than solar years) even before Hijra, while, before the revelation, the years were (probably) regulated on the sun and not on the moon (in the same way of the Jewish calendar). I feel that even Muslim scholars would be puzzled about the &#34;right&#34; way to calculate such dates. This pitfall shows how improper is trying to extend the Islamic calendar back before its creation. The only solution is writing &#34;jahiliyya&#34; or simply erasing the &#34;islamic calendar&#34; from older dates.&#60;br /&#62;
Similar problem with the <a href="" title="Iranian calendar">Iranian calendar</a> (and maybe other calendars which have a historical beginning but disregard the very concept of use &#34;backwards&#34;). What should we do with such calendars, which have a sense &#34;after&#34; their beginning but none &#34;before&#34;? I think that forcing them to express &#34;negative&#34; years is inappropriate and probabily mistaken. --<a href="" title="User:Vermondo">Vermondo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Vermondo">talk</a>) 12:14, 22 May 2009 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Short-term_topic_bans_.28similar_to_3RR.29">Short-term topic bans (similar to 3RR)</span></h2>

<p>Okay, I have an idea floating around in the back of my head and you people are tasked to tell me why it&#39;s a stupid one. Here goes: We have a system in place, namely <a href="" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, that is designed to avoid edit warring, no matter who the person violating 3RR is. Sometimes, looking at ANI or similar noticeboards, I wonder whether we need a similar policy to handle people who keep on repeating the same statements in discussions and their continued participation is more disruptive than helpful, although their behavior does not allow a block. With my idea, a group of editors trusted to be neutral and uninvolved (I&#39;d suggest crats and/or ArbCom members), could issue, where needed, a short term topic ban to any editor who has continued to repeat their statements without adding anything new (like continuing to call for some user to be punished whenever someone disagrees with that proposal). Such behavior is usually quite tiresome and not helpful. If someone were to add the same content to an article over and over again despite disagreement, they&#39;d be blocked for violating 3RR. I think when the same happens with statements on a discussion, then it should be equally possible to &#34;block&#34; an editor from participating in that discussion for a short time.

<li>Sorry, couldn&#39;t pass that up.  I do think the idea is valid, but it&#39;s going to get <i>really</i> subjective really fast.  Much more than most admin actions frankly.  And sometimes it&#39;s important to actually repreat things.  The FT RfA discussion I think had a user that might have been blocked from the discussion by that definition and i think it would have been a shame.  The only cases I&#39;ve seen where I think it would have been useful are those who are arguing with things on the other &#34;side&#34; from me.  That really makes me worry about the overly subjective nature of doing this.  Just too scary and I&#39;ve almost always seen these things work themselves out over time.  The real problem is when there are two of them (one on each &#34;side&#34;) that things get ugly. <a href="" title="User:Hobit">Hobit</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hobit">talk</a>) 00:37, 23 May 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<dd>Guido den Broeder please tell me you were being sarcastic when you said &#34;in the correct version, of course&#34;, because no matter what a version is protected it&#39;ll be the &#34;wrong version&#34; and the person blocking it will be accused of &#34;favoritism&#34; (and called really bad names), I&#39;m sure we&#39;ve all seen that happen. As for the proposal it is sometimes important to repeat yourself, too many editors who come into a discussion in the middle or towards the &#34;end&#34; only skim the points made and/or really read the last comment or two and make stupid comments supporting or disagreeing without really knowing the full &#34;story&#34; and therefore one side or both feels compelled to &#34;inform&#34; the newbie to win them over. And other times the other side is just plain stupid and doesnt get the point and needs to be curmudgeoned with it. There are policies in place to deal with disruptive editors who threaten or harrass, as long as an editor in a discussion is keeping TO THE TOPIC at hand then why ban them? Not a rhetorical question, anyone can answer if they think it will help me understand, I&#39;m open to learning and changing my opinion. Of course there is always an editor&#39;s personal ability that we all share, and that ability is simply to ignore the stupid. Blocking for repeatly putting info back into an article is appropriate because that disrupts encyclopedic content that non-editors will see, blocking someone for repeating themselves in a talk page (which non-editors are rarely going to go to) is overblown because it doesnt &#34;hurt&#34; content of the encyclopedia.<a href="" title="User:Camelbinky">Camelbinky</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Camelbinky">talk</a>) 02:51, 23 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The idea that there is no correct version is a myth created by poor/lazy admins. In most cases it&#39;s easy.

The correct version to protect is that of the first user (rather than the version of the admin&#39;s buddy).

<dd>This is where I disagree. It recently came up (but is certainly not limited to) the FAC of <a href="" title="2004 World Series">2004 World Series</a>. The logo of that series in no way enhances my ability to learn about the topic, and yet there it is in all of its fair use glory. That image does not pass WP:NFCC policy 8 and yet there it is (not to mention the logo for every World Series, Stanley Cup Finals, Super Bowl, etc.) Whoever is cutting these &#34;gratutious&#34; images are not going far enough. I&#39;m not worried about legal issues, I&#39;m just wondering why we continue to pretend this is a free encyclopedia. &#60;span style=&#34;font-family: tahoma&#34;&#62;<b><a href="" title="User:Blackngold29">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;black&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Blackngold29">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#B8860B&#34;&#62;ngold29&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#60;/span&#62; 21:48, 20 May 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agreed with EVula. The goal is to be free, but the goal is also to be <i>complete</i>, and frankly, the latter cannot occur if we adhere to Fasash&#39;s extremist views on the former.  I also disagree somewhat with BlacknGold&#39;s view.  Such logos are a visual representation of the event as it occurs.  Strictly necessary? Perhaps not, but helpful, even if only a little.  Where it would cross the line would be if team logos were added to the World Series article, or the World Series logo was atted to the team articles, as that would be blatantly gratuitous. It all comes down to balance, imo. <a href="" title="User:Resolute">Reso</a><a href="" title="User Talk:Resolute">lute</a> 22:12, 20 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Right, but my point is that the criteria states &#34;used only if its presence would <i>significantly</i> increase readers&#39; understanding of the topic, and its omission would be detrimental to that understanding.&#34; Removing the logo of the World Series doesn&#39;t decrease my knowledge about it one bit. When I nominated <a href="" title="PNC Park">PNC Park</a> as an FA this was brought to my attention for the first time, and after removing the park&#39;s logo I came to realize that the article actually looks better without it. Wouldn&#39;t it be more beneficial to the reader to see a picture of the Series&#39; MVP? Or (when avalible) a picture from a game itself? I think people get lazy, they just say &#34;We&#39;ll throw the logo in the infobox.&#34; When there are a number of possibilities that are free and actually improve the article. All that being said, when it comes to team logos or albums I tend to be more lenient. &#60;span style=&#34;font-family: tahoma&#34;&#62;<b><a href="" title="User:Blackngold29">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;black&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Blackngold29">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#B8860B&#34;&#62;ngold29&#60;/span&#62;</a></b>&#60;/span&#62; 01:24, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>(As an aside, many logos are treated as nonfree when they should actually be tagged with <a href="" title="Template:PD-textlogo">Template:PD-textlogo</a>...)  Whether an image is significant or insignificant to an article topic is really a matter for discussing on that article&#39;s talk page.  But generally speaking, and as Dcoetzee expresses below, it&#39;s certainly reasonable that the logo by which a commercial enterprise has been presented to the public is a significant part of how it&#39;s identified, and that how that enterprise was branded is relevant information.  Companies use logos exactly because they perform that function.  <a href="" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Postdlf">talk</a>) 02:01, 21 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>All of the image examples given above are noncontroversial and well-established uses of non-free content, and all very sound legally.  Obsessing over these is completely nonproductive, particularly given that non-free content isn&#39;t limited to images.  Non-free content also includes quotations from copyrighted text and even summaries of copyrighted fiction.

<dd>It is, however, a matter of principle.  I agree with the Fasach Nua that we are <i>far</i> too liberal in our non-free content policy.  My view has always been that we should only have non-free images that are essential to an understanding of the topic in hand.  You can&#39;t have the article <a href="" title="Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima">Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima</a> without a non-free photograph; most pages will survive quite happily without non-free images that are essentially decoration.  The fact that the use of such media is <i>legal</i> is quite beside the point: the free encyclopaedia should be as free as it possibly can be.  <a href="" title="User:Sam Korn">&#60;nowiki&#62;<a href="" title="Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a>&#60;/nowiki&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Sam Korn">(smoddy)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 22:34, 20 May 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>This is largely a philosophical discussion, but I think the <i>status quo</i> is just fine - &#34;free&#34; is not an end in itself, but a means to an end: a way of enabling wider reuse under a variety of circumstances. Fair use images are okay because: 1. there are many contexts in which they can be safely reused; 2. because they can be systematically removed. One should not underestimate the value of images that appear to be &#34;decorative&#34; such as logos - a logo is, in effect, another <i>name</i> used to recognize the subject. I believe it&#39;s a critical part of a subject&#39;s representation. <a href="" title="User:Dcoetzee">Dcoetzee</a> 23:35, 20 May 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Postdlf states <i>&#34;All of the image examples given above are noncontroversial and well-established uses of non-free content...&#34;</i>, which is entirely true, however the use is not consistant with nfcc. The problem I see is the inconsistancy between policy and well-established practice and one of the two needs to be modified, either a more liberal FU policy, or the application of the existing one <a href="" title="User:Fasach Nua">Fasach Nua</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Fasach Nua">talk</a>) 05:56, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Well perhaps the problem then is with NFCC itself. NFCC #8 - which is liberally over-applied as a bludgeon against all sorts of images by some editors - is utterly subjective. While there is certainly a need for an image to be relevant and contribute to the article in some way, the clause is clumsily written and just begs a fight. Two different editors can quite honestly and legitimately come to the table with one saying an image does not enhance my understanding, while the other says that it does indeed help my understanding. NFCC #8 needs to be re-worked and should not be - as it currently stands - in and of itself sufficient cause to arbitrarily remove an image with discussion. I understand there is a process for such things ... <a href="" title="User:Wiggy!">Wiggy!</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wiggy!">talk</a>) 14:41, 21 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>The problem as I see it is that in many subjects the goals of &#34;free&#34; and &#34;encyclopedia&#34; are in tension: coverage that is limited to free content cannot be comprehensive, and comprehensive coverage must in some circumstances include nonfree content.  The reason that in <i>practice</i> Wikipedia uses more nonfree content than a strict reading of its mission might suggest is that most Wikipedia contributors don&#39;t really care about the philosophical underpinnings of the free culture movement.  They&#39;re interested in the <i>product</i>, an encyclopedia anyone can edit.  As a result, they often want to include nonfree content simply because for copyrighted material it contributes to comprehensive coverage of the subject.  It just makes sense that an article on a book would include a picture of the book&#39;s cover.</dd>
<dd>The policy question Fasach raises is really a question of whether policy should <i>prescribe</i> behavior, or <i>describe</i> practices as they exist.  As <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines">Wikipedia:Policies and guidelines</a> notes, the latter is generally more effective.  Honestly, I think that the Wikipedia community is too big now to enforce more prescription — we can barely enforce the rules we&#39;ve got.  The free content goal of Wikipedia is still part of our intention, but if we want it to be part of the encyclopedia&#39;s practices imposing more restrictions from above isn&#39;t the way to do it.  That will just cause more resentment and conflict.  Instead, I think that we need more education and community outreach, to explain the importance of free content and encourage its use in all possible circumstances. —<a href="" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 06:30, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

<dd><i>most Wikipedia contributors don&#39;t really care about the philosophical underpinnings of the free culture movement.</i> -- indeed. I obviously I have no proof, but I would imagine that if WP suddenly removed all it&#39;s non-free content, or even just limited to the the sort where the article is actaully about the content in question (cases like the Iwo Jima example) -- which is what some people want, I&#39;ll grant -- a LOT of editors would leave, and WP would very likely get a good deal more bad press than it already does. Again, I have no proof, but it&#39;s what I imagine would happen. Also, a lot of the time free content makes the article WORSE, not better (in terms of the article itself, not the mission and such). Yes yes, obviously living people need free pics, but often they are so horrid it WOULD be better without them. True in many other cases as well. It&#39;s actually funny that a somewhat similar argument, in a sense, is going on at an RP game I&#39;m at. Some people think that text alone should be sufficient, and anyone using pictures is lazy, where others are much more visually oriented and like having them -- it&#39;s the same here, many people simply &#39;click&#39; better when there&#39;s an extra illustrative element to things. A logo or boxart to represent what&#39;s being described helps to make a...how to put this...association in the mind. &#39;Further understanding&#39;?

<p>I would point out that our Free encyclopedia also contains many copyrighted quotes that are only allowed under fair use. Like Josiah says: &#34;The problem as I see it is that in many subjects the goals of &#34;free&#34; and &#34;encyclopedia&#34; are in tension: coverage that is limited to free content cannot be comprehensive, and comprehensive coverage must in some circumstances include nonfree content.&#34; I&#39;m of the firm believe that Fair use is a good thing in Wikipedia. Definitely in text, and in images as long as it is properly tagged. And I&#39;m a Free junkie, just so you know. That doesn&#39;t mean there are no limits, but Logo&#39;s and promotional posters and stuff hardly infringe on the monetary value the copyrighted work has if we would not use it. As a matter of fact, it&#39;s free promotion for them, with also a lot of benefit to our readers. Although I agree that the older &#34;screenshot&#34; issue with TV series and movies was problematic at times, I do think we are on a better path here.

<dd>&#34;we can barely enforce the rules we&#39;ve got&#34;, Josiah? Let&#39;s be frank about it. We can&#39;t, or rather we don&#39;t. Anyone with experience of RfCs can tell you they tend to get little response. The community simply can&#39;t be bothered to enforce policy. I&#39;m talking about content policy here of course.

<dd>Let&#39;s just say that the content policy as <i>practiced</i> is significantly looser than the content policy as <i>written</i>.  And Melodia is right — if we <i>did</i> attempt a strict interpretation of the free content portion of our mission, to something like the German model, there would be a <b>huge</b> negative reaction from the contributor base and from the culture-at-large (media et al.).  The only way to enforce a significantly tighter non-free content policy would be to abandon the idea that Wikipedia governs itself by consensus. —<a href="" title="User:Josiah Rowe">Josiah Rowe</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Josiah Rowe">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Josiah Rowe">contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 15:24, 21 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Let&#39;s ask ourselves what we&#39;re trying to accomplish here.  Philosophical imperatives are just meaningless soundbites if we don&#39;t understand what those mean in concrete practice, by real people doing real things.  If we&#39;re convinced non-free usage on WP is on solid legal ground, then whether the content is &#34;free&#34; or not is purely a concern regarding downstream users&#39; ability to use WP content freely, correct?  As noted above, the &#34;irreplaceability&#34; requirement for non-free content means that no free content is ever getting supplanted.  So the inclusion of non-free content does not mean anyone is missing out on free content.  The only issue is then the ability of downstream users to filter out non-free content when they re-use Wikipedia articles and images.</p>
<p>In practice, this should not be difficult, as all non-free images are tagged as such, and raw article text obviously contains only pointers to those images and not the images themselves.  Then the only problem for downstream use is removing the image tags from the raw article text.  We could probably make that process easier by adding something to image tags for non-free images that makes them identifiable as such within the raw article text itself.  <a href="" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Postdlf">talk</a>) 21:19, 21 May 2009 (UTC)

<p>I can think of one argument for limiting non free content, even if its considered fair use. someone reading a WP article with a logo on it MIGHT get the impression that the article is endorsed by the logos bearer. its shaky, but i think its a good reason on top of others to not have multiple logos on pages like &#34;world series&#34;. I think the issue of whether the structure of a WP article (links, images, format) misleads the reader as to the importance of the article should be addressed at times. i know that multiple blue links to things like month and date, or common words, at first made me think &#34;wow, this guy is in the list of dates, or is referenced in the article on &#34;god&#34;, so he must be important&#34;. And i absolutely think that a lot of nonfree images help significantly, such as the covers of books which are illustrated by notable illustrators.

<dd>Given that all of Wikipedia&#39;s content is framed by its graphic background and its own logo (and URL), and given public awareness of the nature of what Wikipedia is, I think we&#39;d really have to go out of our way to suggest third-party endorsement, like a statement at the top of the page saying &#34;this page is sponsored by Microsoft.&#34;  But anyway, implied endorsement is not a non-free content issue because it&#39;s not relevant to copyright, nor is it specific to pictorial logos that could be copyrighted.

<dd>The danger of OR is less with these pages than it is with other articles on Wikipedia.  Actually it is much less, because we have a fantastic WikiProject/development team working on these.  The approach is also very neutral - these are &#34;reverse outlines&#34;, built for the most part of links found on Wikipedia about each subject - they are being built from what&#39;s already here! (Most of the redlinks are standard names based on typical subject expansion patterns).  And we&#39;re in the process of making all relevant subject-related WikiProjects aware of the piece of this system that corresponds to their respective subjects, so they can help build them and keep an eye on things.  Actually, that&#39;s what caught Dab&#39;s attention and why we&#39;re in this discussion today!  So the approach is definitely working.  <a href="" title="User talk:The Transhumanist">&#60;i&#62;The Transhumanist&#60;/i&#62;</a>  01:09, 25 May 2009 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Wikipedia:Equality"><a href="" title="Wikipedia:Equality">Wikipedia:Equality</a></span></h2>

<p>The idea has been swirling in my head for a <i>very</i> long time on this, and from a variety of bits of feedback over time, and the massive amounts of commentary on-Wiki the past couple of days that somehow we admins are &#34;above the rules&#34;, or somehow held to a differing standard than everyone else, I present an utterly simple proposal:</p>

<dd>While the idea sounds sympathetic, it is IMHO counter-productive for several reasons. First of all, users are not equal, and should not be treated as though they are. Some users are knowledgeable about the topics they contribute to, while others are clearly not. Currently Wikipedia favours the second group, because there are more of those and because it is far easier to add random text than to improve an article. Your principle would solidify this situation. Second, Wikipedia does not have the structure to enforce anything like this. It is extremely easy for someone with buttons, or with support from someone with buttons, to ignore it and get away with that, just like they can ignore policies and guidelines now. Third, policies are not rules, and therefore never binding, nor are they set in stone. Sometimes they even conflict with each other. Each case has to be judged on its merits, in fact it happens that a case where a policy is not applied gives rise to a change of the policy. With your rule in place, this natural process would be eliminated.

<p>The main problem with it is that it&#39;s simply not true - IPs are banned without a second glance while embedded admins can pretty much do what they like.

<dd>Yes, it is established practice that only stable gadgets and tested versions should be put online (see <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Gadget">Wikipedia:Gadget</a>). Unfortunately, as with any software, it is not possible to detect very rare malfunctions before the release if they only happen under certain rare and highly specific circumstances (different operating systems, exotic browsers or browser versions, gadget interactions... For example, it was not possible to replicate the above problems by using exactly the same browser versions and gadgets!).</dd>
<dd>Multi-stage release cycles are not practical for gadgets and would be detrimental to quick bug fixes and improvements. In case something really bad happens and the developer is not reachable (which was not the case) it is always possible to deactivate a gadget on its <i>MediaWiki:Gadget-scriptname.js</i> page. <a href="" title="User:Cacycle">Cacycle</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cacycle">talk</a>) 23:02, 26 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dd>The reason &#34;big words&#34; are used, is that they are more precise and correct. Any uncommon terms should be wikilinked anyway, so you can learn what they mean. <i>in media res</i> is a specific literary technique and <i>necrotizing fasciitis</i> is a specific disease. If you&#39;re after a dumbed-down encyclopaedia that uses more common and simple words, try <a href="" title="simple:Main Page">Simple English Wikipedia</a>. Sorry if this seems a little harsh, but I feel learning is one of the primary purposes of Wikipedia. In some situations using overly-complicated language is unnecessary, but don&#39;t go changing things just because they use &#34;big words&#34;. <a href="" title="User:OrangeDog">OrangeDog</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:OrangeDog">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/OrangeDog">edits</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 05:38, 27 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If a word is wikilinked, I understand that it goes to either a term that is shown or to a more complicated/informative version of the word that is there.  If it is a word that is shown, I usually find it appropriate if it&#39;s someone&#39;s name or the name of an event, etc...  If it&#39;s a term that people feel like using because they happen to know it, I find it obnoxious.  I feel like I could go look up some words in the dictionary and then go around and replace every instance of words that are related to it with that word...  Informative, maybe.  Annoying, yes.  However, if it&#39;s wikilinked with the more complicated word, then I can put my mouse over it and learn a new word for it.  I find that simpler than being forced to go to another page to learn what it means, especially when reading the summary of a movie.  Sorry, I&#39;m not implying that I&#39;m dumb and need simpler words.  <a href="" title="User:Jabberwockgee">Jabberwockgee</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Jabberwockgee">talk</a>) 05:57, 27 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I love how anon&#39;s are not supposed to be treated differently, they are to be treated with respect, their contributions in articles and their opinions on talk pages are to be treated with good-faith and with the same weight as those editors who have signed-in, BUT alot of editors on wikipedia spend so much time thinking of ways in which we can discourage anons like they are ALL vandals and need to be controlled. Some people just DONT want to sign up but still want to contribute. What is so wrong with that? It&#39;s not like the only vandals out there are IP addresses, forcing people to sign up by making it more difficult to edit with an IP address, will not bring the number of vandals and acts of vandalism down it will simply shift it to being made by those with usernames and probably make the number of sockpuppets go up as we then start blocking more usernames.<a href="" title="User:Camelbinky">Camelbinky</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Camelbinky">talk</a>) 18:02, 23 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>

<li>The best place to go for guidance on when to use a show&#39;s official website or even the show itself is at <a href="" title="WP:PRIMARY">WP:PRIMARY</a> (part of <a href="" title="WP:NOR">no original research</a>). If you&#39;re making an interpretation from what is broadcasted or shown on the show&#39;s website, then you need a secondary source. Otherwise, you can only use it to describe the show (for instance, when the show was first made, who are the main actors, who produced it, etc. - trivial descriptive stuff). Also, exercise caution when using primary sources to describe fictional/plot elements of the show that it falls under the Manual of Style, more particularly <a href="" title="WP:WAF">writing about fiction</a>; there it is very easy to stray from strictly describing the plot/storyline and making inferences about it, which would be original research (unless, of course, you are able to back that inference up with a verifiable secondary source).</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Is_this_really_a_disambiguation_page.3F">Is this really a disambiguation page?</span></h2>

<p>I leave it entirely to others to decide, and I will not intervene further.  But to me it seems nonsense to set up a &#34;disambiguation&#34; page for a word like &#34;<a href="" title="Sanctorum">Sanctorum</a>&#34;, when <i>none</i> of the items referred to on the page is called by that name.  The page does not <i>disambiguate</i> the word.  The page <a href="" title="Sanctorum">Sanctorum</a> is merely a substitute for typing the word &#34;sanctorum&#34; in the Search box and clicking &#34;Search&#34; (not &#34;Go&#34;).  A number of similar pages have recently been created.  Are they worth keeping?  If they are, is it appropriate to call them &#34;disambiguation&#34; pages?  Or &#34;search&#34; pages?  Or &#34;index&#34; pages?  <a href="" title="User:Soidi">Soidi</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Soidi">talk</a>) 16:19, 18 May 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I would say they are worth keeping. Keep in mind that most times such a word would normally be used as a redirect to one of the individual articles if multiple options did not excist. But when redirecting towards multiple pages, how can man determine which article is more important? And how can people know what the name of a page would be? For example when i type <a href="" title="Agile">Agile</a> i will go to a similar page. In my case i am looking for <a href="" title="Agile software development">Agile software development</a>. If i did not know the name how would i find the article? Maybe it would be called Agile (Software) or Agile (Software Development). As for calling them disambiguation pages: The policy itsself states that they are used in case a word can refer to multiple things - and that can also include non exact name matches <a href="" title="User:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;191970&#34;&#62;<b>Excirial</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; (<a href="" title="User talk:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contact me&#60;/font&#62;</a>,<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 20:49, 18 May 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I suppose Excirial must be right, but I do think there is an essential difference between looking for &#34;Agile software development&#34; (which could go under various names) under <a href="" title="Agile">Agile</a> and looking for anything (what?) under <a href="" title="Sanctorum">Sanctorum</a> which is not a word that can refer to multiple things, since it <i>always</i> has the meaning &#34;of holy persons or things&#34;, and which isn&#39;t the first word in even one of the phrases linked to.  (Yes, I have intervened again.  But only to clarify my meaning.)  <a href="" title="User:Soidi">Soidi</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Soidi">talk</a>) 19:35, 19 May 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It looks like a perfectly reasonable page to me. &#34;Sanctorum&#34; may not be the first word in any of those phrases, but it is certainly a major one, and one which someone unsure of the complete phrase might search for. It seems to me the real reason for any disambiguation page to exist is to make it easier for someone to find the actual article being sought, and this page does that. <a href="" title="User:LadyofShalott">&#60;font color=&#34;#ee3366&#34;&#62;<b>Lady</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="Special:Contributions/LadyofShalott">&#60;font color=&#34;#229922&#34;&#62;<i>of</i>&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User_Talk:LadyofShalott">&#60;font color=&#34;#0095c6&#34;&#62;<b>Shalott</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> 19:00, 20 May 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The word (and any apparently very specific word) doesnt necessarily mean the same thing all the time. maybe for now it does, but i could create a notable software program called &#34;Sanctorum&#34; which, say, organizes a churches projects. I think this is a good disambig. i was surprised at first how many disambigs link to somewhat marginal articles, but this doesnt really get in the way of its functionality, as long as they are in a reasonable order of usefulness. <a href="" title="User:Mercurywoodrose">Mercurywoodrose</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mercurywoodrose">talk</a>) 15:57, 25 May 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I tend to agree with Soidi. Apart perhaps for the first item listed in that page, in all the others the word &#34;sanctorum&#34; is just one of the words in a longer phrase. So should we have dab pages for all words in all article titles including more than one word? When more than one thing explicitly called &#34;Sanctorum&#34; (or something very similar) will show up, the disambiguation page will make sense. <a href="" title="User:Goochelaar">&#60;span style=&#39;font-family: &#34;Palatino&#34;&#39;&#62;Goochelaar&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;(<a href="" title="User talk:Goochelaar">talk</a>) 22:14, 29 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Does this mean you&#39;d like to keep DAB pages linking only to articles with exactly the same name?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="An_open_letter_to_the_Wikipedia_Board">An open letter to the Wikipedia Board</span></h2>

<p>A policy now in place at Wikipedia deeply troubles a growing number of us in the community. We&#39;ve observed that Wikipedia articles are increasingly being held hostage to political correctness at the expense of free expression and historical accuracy. I could cite a number of instances, but two examples are prime examples:</p>
<p>1. Kent Hovind. Mr. Hovind is a controversial figure primarily because of his college campus debate successes in support of intelligent design (ID), specifically, young earth creationism. The Wikipedia entry is clearly biased against Mr. Hovind because it reads like a tabloid dossier of innuendo, half-truth and accusation. Somehow, the primary individuals responsible for writing this wiki entry have successfully blocked editorial access to those who have first hand knowledge of Mr. Hovind, preventing contributors from balancing the entry with factual information.</p>
<p>2. President Barack Obama. Despite the noteworthy accomplishments and stature of America&#39;s first African American president, the current Wiki entry portrays a largely propagandistic and blemish-free version of Obama. This verbally-photoshopped caricature omits controversies regarding Mr. Obama&#39;s past associations and questions surrounding the documentation of his citizenship, even when substantiated by published mainstream sources, verified documents and first hand knowledge. This entry&#39;s gatekeepers have systematically censored such additions. Barack Obama is an historic figure, but the best Wikipedia now can offer is a locked entry that is biased, factually-gutted and largely irrelevant, reading more like an Obama campaign press release than a reputable and credible reference source.</p>
<p>I am sure your board recognize the danger when an information technology is co-opted by propagandists--regardless of their point of view--both in terms of relevance and the muzzling of free speech and free access to information. I hope you and your editorial board will address these abuses and make Wikipedia available to all points of view, so it can achieve its goal of being the world&#39;s first truly universal database of knowledge freely available to all.</p>

<p>I do not see how this points out anything beyond &#34;there are npov disputes&#34;. Which is hardly something new on Wikipedia. The vocabulary chosen by Voicewr to state this unremarkable fact (propagandists, censored, muzzling of free speech) isn&#39;t only completely inadequate, it also shows the classic confusion of (valid) npov concerns with (invalid) demands to use Wikipedia as a platform for &#34;free speecch&#34;.

<p>I think wikipedia is a great source of knowledge but one thing I find perturbing is article about historical events etc. that include &#34;cultural references&#34; at the end talking about how it was mentioned / portrayed in some science fiction or other not particularly famous book, clearly inserted by some rabid fan type.  Can you delete these things?  I have seen it many times, what inspired me to finally ask was the <a href="" title="Wootz_steel">Wootz_steel</a> article I just read.  At the end it includes a &#34;cultural references&#34; section talking about how an &#34;elaborate fictionalized manufacture&#34; of it is included in random books, and the last line is a real gem, &#34;Don Krieg of One Piece wears armor made of Wootz steel.&#34;  Is this really the type of information that should be included in a decently respectable source of information.  Even worse, many articles include &#39;references&#39; that state something to the effect that some obscure band that probably 1000 people have heard of mentions the event / person in one of their songs.

<dd>My questions is related to this, so instead of a new thread I figure I will pose it here as an extension of the original question. Mine concerns municipality articles, many of which have a similar &#34;cultural references&#34; section about tv shows, movies, books, that take place or happen to mention the city. In this one case <a href="" title="Albany, New York">Albany, New York</a> there is even a subsection devoted just to The Simpson&#39;s episodes that reference Albany. I think there should be a place for mentioning that there have been quite alot of references to Albany in the Simpson&#39;s and other tv shows that have an large number of episodes that mention the city (such as Law &#38; Order), other things to keep would be Pulitzer Prize winning books that take place in the city, books about the city that became movies, and maybe a sentence or two that mentions what movies have been filmed in the city.  But that listing in a list format every episode of every tv show/movie that mentions the name Albany is over-kill, and much of what is mentioned in that section is &#34;x character of tv show y is said to have grown up in Albany&#34; and that is ridiculous. I use Albany as an example, I&#39;m sure you could substitute many other cities in there and have that still be the case. Is there a solution for a section title to house such trivia without it being in a trivia format?<a href="" title="User:Camelbinky">Camelbinky</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Camelbinky">talk</a>) 20:22, 29 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>You could look at from the point of view of <a href="" title="wp:notability">notability</a> - if a decent source has mentioned the cultural reference, it&#39;s in - otherwise it&#39;s trivia. For an example of valid cultural references, spiders, snakes, lions and other animals are important in many mythologies, which also gets them notable representation in art and literature. As <a href="" title="User:Camelbinky">Camelbinky</a>, there also in-between cases like the use  of Albany - they may be notable but singly not important. --<a href="" title="User:Philcha">Philcha</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Philcha">talk</a>) 20:37, 29 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Disentangling_race_.26amp.3B_ethnicity">Disentangling race &#38; ethnicity</span></h2>

<p>We&#39;ve a couple of related nominations, intended to help disentangle the many cross-categorization and category intersections that have arisen recently:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#Category:People_by_race_or_ethnicity" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2009 May 28">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2009 May 28</a>
<ul>
<li>eliminating race categories (leaving ethnicity only)</li></ul></li>
<li><a href="#People_not_by_ethnicity" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2009 May 28">Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2009 May 28</a>
<ul>
<li>splitting ethnicity from nationality (leaving nationality only)</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>Should the first be successful, we must amend the <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)">Wikipedia:Naming conventions (categories)</a> and <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons</a> policies and related guidelines to clarify that &#34;race&#34; is not appropriate for categorization.</p>
<p>The second is somewhat dependent on the first. However, the inclusion of ethnic &#34;origin&#34; and &#34;descent&#34; is already against policy without notability, and these should never have been intermixed with the less contentious (more easily verifiable) nationality categories.

<dd>I agree with what you&#39;re saying - that IPs are often unfairly treated. But you&#39;ve got to be careful about going too far the other way. Many editors recognise the importance of IPs and their contributions, and don&#39;t victimise them or treat them any differently to other editors, and you&#39;ve got to ensure you don&#39;t start generalising. Personally, I treat editors harsher than IP addresses with vandalism and such. People who register an account and then abuse it are specifically targeting the &#39;pedia and deserve to be reprimanded more harshly than those who, in passing, fancy having a bit of fun. Myeh. I think you&#39;ve got a good point, but need to be wary of how far you take it. <a href="" title="User:Greg Tyler">&#60;b style=&#34;color:#00A&#34;&#62;Greg Tyler&#60;/b&#62;</a> &#60;sup style=&#34;color:#A00;font-weight:bold;font-size:10px;&#34;&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Greg Tyler">&#60;b style=&#34;color:#A00&#34;&#62;t&#60;/b&#62;</a> &#38;bull; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Greg Tyler">&#60;b style=&#34;color:#A00&#34;&#62;c&#60;/b&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 15:59, 2 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>

<dd>It is slightly ironic that your own graph demonstrates that a far greater proportion of IP editors engage in vandalism than those with registered usernames, however.  <a href="" title="User:Exploding Boy">Exploding Boy</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Exploding Boy">talk</a>) 16:03, 2 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>The graph is somewhat misleading. By including all the edits in one graph, IP vandalism is just a little sliver.

<dd>Deleting the template, IMO, is a side issue to the larger question of whether the users accept the new licensing. I count 128 user pages and 2 user talk pages currently using that template; one of the message delivery bots should inform them of the vote and Board resolution in case they missed it, and tell them what (if anything) they need to do and what (if any) the consequences will be for not doing it. What the appropriate action and consequences should be if they don&#39;t do anything by June 15, I don&#39;t know; it could range from &#34;block until they remove/replace the template&#34; to &#34;assume they accept the license change unless they state otherwise (in which case they get blocked) and rewrite the template on June 15&#34;. <a href="" title="User:Anomie">Anomie</a><a href="" title="User talk:Anomie">⚔</a> 19:17, 23 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Retroactively; the only reason this is able to happen at all (without an impossible mess) is that the GFDL version 1.3 specifically allows this retroactive relicensing. Note that there may be some contention over whether something was &#34;originally published on a non-&#39;Massively Multiauthor Collaboration Site&#39; and added after November 1, 2008&#34;, and I believe there already contention where people uploaded images as &#34;GFDL 1.2 or later&#34; and want to complain about those being relicensed. <a href="" title="User:Anomie">Anomie</a><a href="" title="User talk:Anomie">⚔</a> 15:30, 2 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Is there any other discussion about changes to licensing templates? Who&#39;s responsible for changing this template? What about other templates that might be affected, like  ? <a href="" title="User:Brianjd">Brian</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Brianjd">Jason</a> <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Brianjd">Drake</a> 06:46, 7 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>That template doesn&#39;t exclude the possibility of licensing under CC-BY-SA. (In fact, by including the public domain, it doesn&#39;t exclude <i>anything</i>.) The problem with NoMultiLicense was the word &#34;only&#34;. <a href="" title="User:Rspeer">rspεεr</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Rspeer">talk</a>) 08:08, 7 June 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>That&#39;s actually a good point. Most of the templates don&#39;t say &#34;only&#34; and thus don&#39;t have the same issue.   is technically not a problem as the relicensing is under the terms of the GFDL, but I have notified the affected users who aren&#39;t already dual-licensing under CC-BY-SA-3.0 and haven&#39;t been notified for   anyway.</dd>
<dd>As for who is responsible for changing the templates, unless someone beats me to it I intend to make the changes (or   requests) on the 10th. <a href="" title="User:Anomie">Anomie</a><a href="" title="User talk:Anomie">⚔</a> 16:56, 7 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>I use the template, and I don&#39;t have any problem with the change to CC-BY-SA. Apart from that, the statement in that template does not (in the literal meaning of its words) actually object to what is happening. What the template says is that the Foundation is not granted the right to relicense contributions. The change happening on the 15th is that the GFDL will allow multilicensing under CC-BY-SA. So the switch to dual licensing is not done as a unilateral act of the Foundation, but as a normal use of the rights granted by the GFDL.</p>
<p>The claim that it &#39;is going to cause its users to violate Wikipedia&#39;s copyright terms every time they edit Wikipedia after June 15&#39; seems a little weird to me. Wikipedia&#39;s copyright terms, even after June 15th, will not allow the Foundation to unilaterally change the licence to one incompatible with the GFDL (e.g. to the Free Art licence). If someone edits after June 15th, then <i>they themselves</i> are dual-licensing their content and thus again there is no &#39;relicensing&#39; on the Foundation&#39;s part. Hence there is no conflict between that template and the upcoming changes to the copyright policy. My reason for using the template has nothing to do with an objection to CC - I&#39;ve been using it for years. What it refers to (or at least what it represents to me) is any hypothetical attempt by the Foundation to sell the content under a <i>proprietary licence</i> to a commercial partner. </p>
<p>I would also like to echo Michael Stone&#39;s comment above that the notice on my usertalk was mildly threatening, and in my opinion <a href="" title="WP:CIVIL">inappropriately</a> confrontational. <a href="" title="User:Cynical">Cynical</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cynical">talk</a>) 20:21, 7 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>The template could be interpreted as the user trying to deny Section 11 of the GFDL 1.3, although that was certainly not the original intention as the template existed long before the GFDL 1.3. None the less, I felt it appropriate to make sure those users know about the situation. As I replied above, I&#39;m sorry you misinterpreted the wording. <a href="" title="User:Anomie">Anomie</a><a href="" title="User talk:Anomie">⚔</a> 20:51, 7 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd><i>If someone edits after June 15th, then </i>they themselves<i> are dual-licensing their content...</i>&#60;br /&#62;That&#39;s sort of the point. Wikimedia policy will require users to dual-license the content themselves. Therefore, if users claim that they are <i>not</i> dual-licensing their content (which they would be doing if they continued using <a href="" title="Template:NoMultiLicense">this template</a> in its present form), they would be violating Wikimedia policy. <a href="" title="User:Brianjd">Brian</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Brianjd">Jason</a> <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Brianjd">Drake</a> 06:14, 8 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>(e/c)I find it rather difficult to believe that the original intent of the template was to try to stop the foundation from doing something that would be illegal anyway.

<p>It sounds like I might not have been very clear before.

<p>Sort of echoing Izno&#39;s suggestion,
Are you all trying to win an argument, or solve a problem?  Rather than asking each other to &#34;see <a href="" title="WP:SOME WIKI POLICY">WP:SOME WIKI POLICY</a>&#34;, and accusing each other of bad faith, maybe you could all dial it down a notch? There are several red herrings and distractions that are preventing you from having a grown up conversation:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The &#34;never use undo in an edit dispute&#34; is a <b>side issue</b>, and isn&#39;t quite true. It seems both &#34;sides&#34; are leaving edit summaries when they do it, and there&#39;s nothing about &#34;Undo edit by John Doe because X&#34; that makes it worse than &#34;rv Bob Smith because Y&#34;.

<li>&#34;Single purpose account&#34; has a specific meaning here, and nobody here is an SPA.  I&#39;m racking my brain trying to figure out how calling them SPA&#39;s is going to advance your position, but I can&#39;t.

<li>Baiting goes both ways. I see both &#34;sides&#34; doing it, which makes the fact that both sides are complaining the other is doing it even more disappointing.</li>
<li>If you call someone a name, and they say it&#39;s a &#34;personal attack&#34;, and you reply that calling it a personal attack is a personal attack... well, that looks like people who are more interested in arguing than in solving a problem.</li>

<dd>We have gotten as far as an RFC (request for comment). I disagree with your definition of SPA. But your main point is taken about going on to the next step in mediation. </dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>My point in this talk section was to show this abusive pattern of repetitious deletionism by SPAs. If you have a better word than SPA to describe users who focus on one type of edit, then I am open to it. SPA is a very common word used by spamfighters, and I don&#39;t believe they have a lock on the meaning of &#34;single-purpose&#34; or &#34;single-purpose account&#34;.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>I thought &#34;deletionist&#34; was too strong a word since these SPA editors don&#39;t focus on whole-article deletion for the most part. Maybe &#34;removalist&#34; will work as a new <a href="" title="neologism">neologism</a>. It would work as a new variation of the word. See: </dd>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The reason why Wikipedia can&#39;t allow Non Commercial Usage marked images is the restriction that no money can be asked when distribution those. Wikipedia itself publishes cheap CD issues and printed copies from Wikipedia article&#39;s. Even though these are distributed without the intent to make profit, a small fee is necessarily to cover the cost of CS&#39;s and printed articles. In turn this would mean that money is charged for images - which is against the <a href="" title="Creative Commons licenses">CC-BY-NC-ND</a> policy. <a href="" title="User:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;191970&#34;&#62;<b>Excirial</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62; (<a href="" title="User talk:Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contact me&#60;/font&#62;</a>,<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Excirial">&#60;font color=&#34;FF8C00&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 10:03, 9 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Answers.com, and other sites that copy and frequently update large numbers of Wikipedia pages on their sites, don&#39;t have time to check the copyright status of each image. All the images on Wikipedia are either free or fair-use, and so there is no need for them to check the copyright status of each image. </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If our goal is to put out <a href="" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> illustrated info to the largest number of people, then our current image policy is good.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Notabilty_.28Fiction.29_-_Progress_update">Notabilty (Fiction) - Progress update</span></h2>

<p>Comments are invited from editors with an interest in Wikipedia&#39;s coverage of fiction. <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)">Wikipedia:Notability (fiction)</a> is a specialized version of <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Notability">Wikipedia:Notability</a>, which refers to whether or not a topic should be the subject of a standalone article. A rewrite of the proposed guideline has reached an advanced stage, and contructive criticism would be welcomed with a view to improving it further - see the discussion at <a href="#Ticking_all_the_boxes" title="WT:FICT">WT:FICT</a>.</p>
<p>In its <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_(fiction)&#38;action=history" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Notability_(fiction)&#38;action=history">current version</a>, <a href="" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> ticks all the boxes in terms of inclusion criteria that apply to fiction that fall within the exising framework of Wikipedia <a href="" title="WP:CSP">content and style polcies</a>. It covers all the main points you would expect in a guideline, namely the requirements for:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Real world coverage</li>
<li>Coverage that address the topic directly and in detail</li>
<li>Independent sources</li></ul>

<p>It also address two issues that plague fictional articles, namely:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Splitting of topics into articles more minutiae of detail without providing evidence of notability</li>
<li>Plot summary articles that do not provide balanced coverage in the form of both plot summary <i>and</i> real-world context</li></ul>
<p>It has been agrued that these requirements are more restrictive than the <a href="" title="WP:GNG">General notability guideline</a>, but actually they are applying these principals of article inclusion to fictional topics whilst recognising that they are inherently not real, and hence the requirement for real world evidence of notability.</p>
<p>In order to write about fiction, <a href="" title="WP:FICT">WP:FICT</a> provides guidance on article inclusion that brings all of these principals together. It now ticks all the boxes whilst it does not pretend to provide exmemptions from the existing framework of Wikipedia policies and guidelines that enable us to contribute to articles without having to ask permission from an editorial board or a cabal of administrators. --<a href="" title="User:Gavin.collins">Gavin Collins</a> (<a href="#Top" title="User talk:Gavin.collins">talk</a>|<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Gavin.collins">contribs)</a> 10:09, 9 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Simply put, many of the pages are core articles, and some of the most read ones on the sites. Unfortunately, that means that they also attract a <i>lot</i> of vandalism - so much so that in some cases it becomes a real distraction for the regular editors. (Some people apparently have nothing better to do than to add pleas for Pluto&#39;s planethood and the endless &#34;Uranus&#34; comments.) As such, the articles tend to get semi-protected; whenever they come <i>off</i> protection, the vandalism quickly resumes, and protection ends up being restored.</dd>
<dd>Is this ideal? Certainly not; perhaps the tests of flagged revisions may lead to a more balanced approach. However, the fact that these are some of the more widely read articles does tend to make it necessary to be a bit more cautious. --<b><a href="" title="User:Ckatz">Ckatz</a></b><i>&#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Ckatz">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;chat&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Ckatz">&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;spy&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/small&#62;</i> 22:54, 30 May 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

May and December seems to be particularly problematic months as so many students get eager for vacation.

I&#39;d much rather see more use of rangeblocks to get the attention of school network admins.

<p>In the past I have semi protected <a href="" title="DNA">DNA</a>, <a href="" title="photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> and <a href="" title="cloning">cloning</a>. Any time these are not protected the volume of vandalism to productive edits is about 50 to 1 (guess on my behalf). When you have a lot of these pages on your watch list your whole time is spent reverting petty vandalism rather than writing or commenting on talk pages. So semi-protection serves two purposes here.  One to protect the reader and the other to avoid burnout in science writers. Other strategies to avoid this juvenile vandalism are welcome.  <a href="" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 15:56, 1 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yep.  From my perspective the exercise in unprotecting was to see how many IP&#39;s were adding productively to that article. Obviously some do, the question becomes at what point does the time reverting outweigh the gain? Actually, one trend I have noticed with respect to productive IP editors, on the science pages, is that they will often go to the talk page and mention a specific problem rather than do it themselves (even if the article is not semi-protected). So in those cases the semi-protection does not actually stop them contributing. <a href="" title="User:David D.">David D.</a> <a href="" title="User talk:David D.">(Talk)</a> 21:46, 12 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

The above seems like a good &#34;argument in favour of flagged revs&#34;. It would allow the positive IP contributions while disallowing the vandalism making it to print. I also gather it would discourage a great deal of the vandalism: if it never shows up &#34;to the world&#34; then the motivation for making the edit hopefully goes down.

<p>Greetings. <a class="externallink" href="http://judgepedia.org/" rel="nofollow" title="http://judgepedia.org/">Judgepedia</a> is a Wiki whose content is licensed under the GFDL, per <a class="externallink" href="http://judgepedia.org/index.php/Judgepedia:Copyrights" rel="nofollow" title="http://judgepedia.org/index.php/Judgepedia:Copyrights">Judgepedia:Copyrights</a>. It is not released under a cc license, and I don&#39;t think they have any plans to do so. I opened <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Bots/Requests for approval/Polbot 14">a bot request</a> to import some of Judgepedia&#39;s content into Wikipedia, but it is unclear if this is allowed. Discussion at the bot approval request referred to <a class="externallink" href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html#section11" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/fdl.html#section11">Section 11 of the GFDL</a>, but without a clear outcome. So which is correct?
</p>
<ol>
<li>We could have imported Judgepedia&#39;s content before November 1, 2008, but we can no longer do so.</li>
<li>We can import Judgepedia&#39;s content until June 15, 2009.</li>
<li>We can continue to import Judgepedia&#39;s content indefinitely.</li></ol>

<p>It&#39;s kind of important to know quickly, in case option #2 is correct. &#38;ndash; <a href="" title="User:Quadell">Quadell</a> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User_talk:Quadell">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 17:14, 12 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd> If Judgepedia has no plans to relicense, then #1 is correct.  No GFDL-only text can be imported into Wikipedia after Nov. 1st, 2008.  (After June 15th, any such text should be treated as a copyvio unless the originating site intends to relicense.)  An outreach effort at Meta: <a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update/Outreach">m:Licensing update/Outreach</a> hopes to make as many external GFDL sites aware of the transition as possible, and encourage them to join with us in relicensing.  There is a lot of work to do and relatively limited pool of volunteers.  If you can help out by talking to Judgepedia about this, it will be appreciated.  :-)  <a href="" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dragons flight">talk</a>) 21:54, 13 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

If you know that an external Web site is carrying a work in violation of the creator&#39;s copyright, do not link to that copy of the work. Linking to a page that illegally distributes someone else&#39;s work sheds a bad light on Wikipedia and its editors.

<dd>Indeed, and that is an important distinction. Linking to the PirateBay main page can be appropriate, just like linking to Google or YouTube. Linking to a particular page that violates copyright is not acceptable, in particularly not in order to provide access to the infringing material. BTW, how do we handle Google Books?

<dd>Thirded. If we are going to have an article about The Pirate Bay, it&#39;s encyclopedic to have an external link to the article subject.

<dl>
<dd>It is no expection to the rule, the rule does not applyin that case. Linking to (e.g.) Pirate Bay main page is not linking to a page actually violating copyright. Deeplinking to a copy of (e.g. <a href="" title="Pirates of the Caribbean (movie)">Pirates of the Caribbean (movie)</a>) is something else, that deeplink is an internet page violating copyright. <a href="" title="User:Arnoutf">Arnoutf</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Arnoutf">talk</a>) 18:43, 13 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>In reply to <a href="" title="User:Stephan Schulz">User:Stephan Schulz</a> above, Google Books is not <i>&#34;currently violating away and waiting for the lawsuit to settle&#34;</i>, as anything under copyright (and many things not under copyright, which is VERY annoying) and for which they do not have permission only has small snippets of text up and they are working under the principle that doing so is fair use and in no way a violation. Google Books is in no way a copyio site. <a href="" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DreamGuy">talk</a>) 17:30, 14 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></li></ul>

<dd>The main page of the Pirate Bay site does not violate copyright, as pointed out above (which may be irrelevant considering the amount of copyright violations on the site itself), but it sounds like Brian is trying to claim that Pirate Bay itself does not violate copyright at all, which is certainly not true. The EL rules that say we should link to a official site in no way overrules the foundation rule agaisnt linking to copyvios, as foundation rules trump guideline pages. <a href="" title="User:DreamGuy">DreamGuy</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DreamGuy">talk</a>) 17:30, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>No, Brian&#39;s point is a good one.

<dd>DreamGuy, what is the basis for your claim that the Pirate Bay website has copyright violations on it?  Is it based on some sort of information that other editors can evaluate?

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="IAR.2FSNOW_.3D.26gt.3B_Admin_involvement.3F">IAR/SNOW =&#62; Admin involvement?</span></h2>

<p>This is a problem I was pondering about application and policies and I&#39;d like some opinions. I raised it at ANI on a specific case (see <a href="#On_a_side_note:_Jehochman_involved_admin.3F" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39;_noticeboard/Incidents">here</a>) but as people like to take the case into account, I&#39;d like to ask here for a general opinion.</p>
<p>Imagine the following situation: An admin closes an AFD as SNOW delete. Usually admins wait 7 days and then judge consensus, which is a neutral action, not requiring an admin&#39;s personal views. But is this the same with SNOW? SNOW <a href="" title="WP:SNOW">is defined</a> as ignoring the 7 days waiting period because the admin judges that it&#39;s extremely unlikely that the current consensus can possibly change at all. So SNOW requires two admin actions: 1.) Judging the current consensus <i>and</i> 2.) judging that there is not a snowball&#39;s chance in hell that this will change in the next 7 days. The question I pondered was this: If an admin decides to IAR/SNOW, they are making a statement not only about consensus but about the future development, don&#39;t they? But doesn&#39;t that mean that the admin becomes <a href="" title="WP:INVOLVED">involved</a> and now has a stance on the article&#39;s fate. Further, assuming this is the case, are they be allowed to close a second AFD about the same (recreated and expanded) article or do we have to assume that they are too involved to be able to judge consensus on the second AFD? Again, ignoring the specifics about the <a href="" title="David Boothroyd">David Boothroyd</a> article that made me ponder this question, I&#39;d like to hear some opinions about whether any admin in such a situation as described should be considered <a href="" title="WP:INVOLVED">involved</a> because of their decision to SNOW. Regards <b><a href="" title="User:SoWhy">&#60;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps; color: #AC0000&#34;&#62;So&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:SoWhy">&#60;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps; color: #35628F&#34;&#62;Why&#60;/span&#62;</a></b> 18:29, 9 June 2009 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>It depends. Some articles are an obvious SNOW and should be closed repeatedly. Imagine a vandal constantly recreating a page about themselves which isn&#39;t <i>obviously</i> unnotable but some investigation proves that the sources don&#39;t amount to anything. Everyone&#39;s in agreement that it should be deleted per SNOW, and that happens. On recreation, AfD gets landed with it again and, of course, it goes to SNOW delete (and probably SALT, in this situation). In this case, the closing admin is perfectly at rights to close it twice, as nothing&#39;s changed.</dd>
<dd>Any other situation, however, I completely agree with you. By SNOW closing something which isn&#39;t obvious vandalism and is borderline CSD, the admin is indeed involved. I would say that, as a general rule, admins shouldn&#39;t ever snowball close the same article&#39;s deletion discussion; just to make sure. We have enough active admins for this to be feasible.</dd>
<dd>I&#39;m aware that&#39;s not a great explanation but, nutshell&#39;d, I agree that an admin shouldn&#39;t SNOW close the same topic twice, though it&#39;s probably acceptable in extreme cases. I hope that makes sense. <a href="" title="User:Greg Tyler">&#60;b style=&#34;color:#00A&#34;&#62;Greg Tyler&#60;/b&#62;</a> &#60;sup style=&#34;color:#A00;font-weight:bold;font-size:10px;&#34;&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Greg Tyler">&#60;b style=&#34;color:#A00&#34;&#62;t&#60;/b&#62;</a> &#38;bull; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Greg Tyler">&#60;b style=&#34;color:#A00&#34;&#62;c&#60;/b&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; &#60;small&#62;19:24, 9 June 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;
<dl>
<dd>Closing a deletion discussion, even a WP:SNOW closure, does not make an admin involved.  Being involved generally means having a stake in the situation, for example the admin was a significant contributor to the article, OR the admin contributed to the deletion discussion and gave an opinion.  The use of admin tools does not instantly make an admin involved in a situation; under that logic no admin could ever block a disruptive user more than once or protect an article more than once.  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;contribs&#60;/small&#62;</a> 03:14, 10 June 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The question I pondered was whether the prediction that the consensus will not change anymore (which SNOW means) implies that the SNOWing admin actually does take a stance, not regarding the content but regarding the possibility of discussion. They make a decision not only about the current consensus but about future development which they decide to cut off with the close (i.e. that it can and will only develop in this way). But if they have decided that consensus can and will only develop towards the SNOW-created result, are they not naturally biased in a new discussion where consensus might or might not be the same? Blocking users is not a relevant comparision as my question is regarding applying IAR, not following policy.

<dd>I would agree with Jayron. I would also add that if the second article is a totally new version, then any judgment about the development that may have been made about the old article would be mostly irrelevant to the second discussion, as it would no longer apply.

<dd>Can someone name a useful purpose that SNOW serves other than to cut conversation short? Keep or delete, SNOW should not be used to close XfDs. We have <a href="" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> and <a href="" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a>. To quote WP:SK, &#34;the criteria for speedy deletion cover the circumstances under which pages may be deleted immediately.&#34; and &#34;<a href="" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> is not a valid speedy keep criterion. SNOW may be cited for an <i>early</i> close, but its use is discouraged.&#34; Just because 7 people say &#34;delete&#34; or &#34;keep&#34; in the first hour, does not mean a true consensus won&#39;t form. There is no way for an admin to know if email canvassing has happened, or it was some fluke that a bunch of fan-boys with no understanding of policy showed up before everyone else. Can anyone show any actual instance where SNOW actually helped WP? I&#39;m not saying that SNOW isn&#39;t used often in good faith, I&#39;m just saying that it does absolutely nothing towards helping to form consensus. I&#39;d nominate it for MfD, but I&#39;m sure a flippantly clever admin would close it as SNOW (again), and that would just be hilarious. &#34;Take it to DRV&#34;, they&#39;d say (as they do), and we&#39;d all have a good chuckle at the nominator&#39;s expense. ▫ <b><a href="" title="User:JohnnyMrNinja">&#60;font color=&#34;#202040&#34;&#62;Johnny&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#204040&#34;&#62;Mr&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#206040&#34;&#62;Nin&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#204040&#34;&#62;ja&#60;/font&#62;</a></b> 12:12, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd><a href="" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> is an essay, but is a shorthand way of expressing that no other outcome is possible whether or not <a href="" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> or <a href="" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a> apply. <a href="" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a> is not cited as often as it should for <a href="" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> closes that end in keep, and SK keeps evolving so it may or may not apply even if there is no withdrawal and everyone was acting in good faith: Someone nominates an article for a athlete who has yet to play professionally - during the course of the AFD, the athlete plays professionally and garners lots of coverage, yadda yadda. Perhaps the nominator never goes back to the AFD s/he started but everyone now recognizes that the reason for nomination no longer applies. These get <a href="" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOWed</a> but they are really some application of <a href="" title="WP:SK">WP:SK</a>, whether or not by the book depends on what version you read or who you ask. On deletions, it gets more interesting, as SK implies that an AFD has begun, whereas CSD has no such pre-condition. For example, <a href="" title="WP:CSD">WP:CSD</a> does not apply to pet dogs, so if a newbie user writes an article on his pet dog, someone nominates it for deletion, and a bunch of people !vote delete that it&#39;s not notable and the debate becomes acrimonous but no one but the author expresses a reason to keep it (that he likes Fido and Fido is really special, ahhhh), it seems wise to close the debate early before things get too out of hand and the newbie gets more <a href="" title="WP:BITE">bitten</a> than needed. Whether the admin cites <a href="" title="WP:SNOW">WP:SNOW</a> or <a href="" title="WP:IAR">WP:IAR</a> or whatever, it&#39;s just a shorthand for &#34;enough already, move on&#34;. <a href="" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Carlossuarez46">talk</a>) 01:43, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Pronunciation_policy">Pronunciation policy</span></h2>

<p>I intend no offense in saying this, but I would really like to see some type of Wikipedia policy saying that, wherever feasible, pronunciation guides should be placed in the article&#39;s main infobox rather than being inserted the lead. The pronunciation entries are usually placed in the first sentence, where, to me at least, they significantly disrupt the flow of the text and appear to dominate the description. In addition, long pronunciation entries can impact the layout of the lead section when they collide with the infobox. Finally, as I hardly know how to interpret the pronunciation information, to me they appears as a violation of <a href="" title="WP:Jargon">WP:Jargon</a>. In addition, they are also frequently unreferenced and (in spirit) may conflict with <a href="" title="WP:NOTDIC">WP:NOTDIC</a>. Thus I believe that pronunciation guides belong in the infobox (where a reader can investigate further if they have an interest) and not in the critical first sentence of the article.

<dd>The IPA versus anglicized pronunciations is a simple specificity versus accessibility argument that I won&#39;t rehash. As for location of the pronunciation, that&#39;s currently more just based on tradition and consistency than anything. It certainly disrupts the flow. I created <a href="" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia/Pronunciation_task_force">a task force</a> to try and expand audio pronunciations, which I believe are more important than textual pronunciations of either sort, but this has a long way to go with so few audio contributors. <a href="" title="User:Dcoetzee">Dcoetzee</a> 22:58, 11 June 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>As for IPA vs. other descriptions of pronunciation, as a non-English mother tongue non-linguist, I find IPA transcriptions both more specific and more accessible (than an approximate transcription to be decoded as it would be read by an anglophone). If I don&#39;t know some IPA symbol, its explanation is one click away. <a href="" title="User:Goochelaar">&#60;span style=&#39;font-family: &#34;Palatino&#34;&#39;&#62;Goochelaar&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;(<a href="" title="User talk:Goochelaar">talk</a>) 14:24, 14 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>It might be helpful if there were a general pronunciation template suitable for slotting into an Infobox. That way those projects that decide to relocate pronunciation to the infobox can have a standard template that is maintained in one location (which can also support various translations, &#38;c). Mostly it&#39;s a concern about ease of maintenance and possible conflicts with variables used in templates. The   template inserts a &#34;pronounced&#34; in the line, which can be handled by the infobox parameter column instead.&#38;mdash;<a href="" title="User:RJHall">RJH</a> (<a href="" title="User_talk:RJHall"><i>talk</i></a>) 21:02, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hi, there&#39;s a debate going on in <a href="" title="id:">id:</a> concerning a person (<a href="" title="id:Gusdi Sastra">id:Gusdi Sastra</a>, an Indonesian linguist) who wished that his article should be deleted. It was deleted once, but a sysop, <a href="" title="id:User:Borgx">id:User:Borgx</a> decided to rewrite the article anew, and thus the linguist is crying foul. Is there exists such right as to not having an article about oneself published in Wikipedia? <a href="" title="User:Bennylin">Bennylin</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Bennylin">talk</a>) 11:38, 2 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>No. However, the article must observe relevant laws on what it may say about living people. See <a href="" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>. <a href="" title="User:Peter jackson">Peter jackson</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Peter jackson">talk</a>) 14:47, 2 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>The &#34;right to vanish&#34; refers to wikipedia editors who wish to have their editing account disappear. It is not related in any way to non-editors who do not wish wikipedia to have an article about them. The latter issue has been debated for a long time, and all that can be said is there is no general system by which a person can get his or her biography deleted from wikipedia. &#38;mdash;&#38;nbsp;Carl &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:CBM">CBM</a>&#38;nbsp;·&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:CBM">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 14:54, 2 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>The question of whether there should / could be an article on person X is really determined by that person&#39;s <a href="" title="WP:N">notability</a>.  If X is clearly notable then there is no reason not to have a <a href="" title="WP:BLP">policy-compliant</a> article about him or her - and the more prominent and notable the person, the stronger becomes the argument that there <i>should</i> be such an article.  For example, the President of the United States and the former Deputy Prime Minister of New Zealand are both clearly notable for English Wikipedia and each of them should have an article, but not having an article on the former would be a much bigger omission that not having one on the latter.  (Sorry New Zealand, but it is true.)  If X is clearly not notable then any article on X should be deleted, and a nomination at <a href="" title="WP:AfD">AfD</a> should produce a clear consensus for a <i>delete</i> close.  The circumstance in which the X&#39;s view might carry some weight is when notability is borderline - basically, when a reasonable argument can be made for deleting the article and a similarly reasonable argument can be made for retaining it.  In such circumstances, some editors are swayed by the preferences of the article&#39;s subject in deciding their !vote on retention or deletion of a BLP article.  So, if X is actually <a href="" title="WP:N">wiki-notable</a> she or he really has no choice but to accept the existence of the article - but has every right to use the talk page to discuss content and to ensure the article is compliant with all relevant policies.  OTRS can help deal with material that is libelous / slanderous, etc., so X has recourse against untrue / unverifiable negative article content.  If X is borderline- or non-notable then the approach available is to nominate the article for deletion, and make a <i>policy-based</i> case for a lack of notability.  Adding to that case the person&#39;s preference for no article is fine, but &#34;I don&#39;t want it&#34; is not recommended as an argument for deletion, as it carries little weight.  The decision on whether to keep or delete will be made at the close of the discussion based on the consensus of the participants and the policy-suppported issues raised.  The article&#39;s subject needs to understand that the broad consensus of the community is binding on questions of content, within the limits of policy.  <a href="" title="User:EdChem">EdChem</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:EdChem">talk</a>) 04:16, 3 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>So becoming &#34;notable&#34; and thus &#34;Wikipedia-worthy&#34; is like the direct result of writing <a href="#Daftar_penelitian.2Fpublikasi" title="id:Gusdi_Sastra">so many books and papers</a>. From my observation, there is a hint that the subject misunderstood what Wikipedia is and is not. The motive for the request still need to be clarified further.

<dd>Strictly speaking, the number of books and papers you&#39;ve written does not determine notability, at least on the English wikipedia. This is accordance to our own <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Notability (people)">Wikipedia:Notability (people)</a> and <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Notability (academics)">Wikipedia:Notability (academics)</a> and other policies. The only thing that establishes notability is significant coverage in reliable secondary sources. It is generally presumed that if one has significant literary output then coverage is a given and for this reason evidence of a significant literary output will usually be taken as sufficient evidence for notability but if there is really no significant coverage in reliable secondary sources then the person is not notable no matter how much they&#39;ve written. <a href="" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nil Einne">talk</a>) 03:16, 6 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Because there is no such <a href="" title="precedent">precedent</a> in id.wiki (this would be the first time someone asked an article about himself to be removed), I would like to ask if there is any precedent here in en.wiki regarding someone who wishes the article about him/herself removed from English Wikipedia? <a href="" title="User:Bennylin">Bennylin</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Bennylin">talk</a>) 09:36, 9 June 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>I would refer you to <a href="" title="WP:AB">WP:AB</a>. If the person in notable enough, the article should remain where it is. Imagine if former US president <a href="" title="George W. Bush">George W. Bush</a> asked his article to be removed. There is no question that the article would remain in place because he is way too notable. As per <a href="" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> the article shouldn&#39;t contain any contentious material that is poorly sourced but other than that this person has no right to ask for his article to be removed. --&#38;ndash; <a href="" title="User:Sampi">sampi</a> &#60;sup&#62;(&#60;font color=&#34;blue&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Sampi">talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;•&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Sampi">contrib</a>&#60;/font&#62;•&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Emailuser/Sampi">email</a>&#60;/font&#62;)&#60;/sup&#62; 06:38, 11 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="CSD_for_WP:MADEUP">CSD for <a href="" title="WP:MADEUP">WP:MADEUP</a></span></h2>

<p>It seems that often obviously <a href="" title="WP:MADEUP">WP:MADEUP</a> articles are going all the way to AfD.  I&#39;ve thought about it myself, and seen it mentioned a few times; maybe we should make obviously made up stuff specifically speedy deletable.  Some of them are falling into A7, but A7 has very specific class restrictions that often prevent it from being applied.  Also simply saying &#34;This is the best thing ever&#34; could be an assertion of notability.  A1 can be used on really short articles, but still often misses.  What do you all think?  Does a CSD for WP:MADEUP sound plausible? <a href="" title="User:Gigs">Gigs</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gigs">talk</a>) 15:24, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>It should go to AfD, there is no way to tell if some crap topic like <a href="" title="beer pong">beer pong</a> is notable without researching it a little. That sort of thing is better to put through AfD, which gives people time to find sources or relevance, but also gives a record of why it shouldn&#39;t be recreated. ▫ <b><a href="" title="User:JohnnyMrNinja">&#60;font color=&#34;#202040&#34;&#62;Johnny&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#204040&#34;&#62;Mr&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#206040&#34;&#62;Nin&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#204040&#34;&#62;ja&#60;/font&#62;</a></b> 21:38, 10 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>If it&#39;s madeup and clearly disruptive, it&#39;s covered under <a href="" title="WP:G3">G3</a> as a blatant hoax. If it&#39;s not, JohnnyMrNinja is correct, sometimes things that sound made up are actually not made up at all and PROD and AFD can cover those few articles as well. <a href="" title="WT:CSD">WT:CSD</a> has a set of requirements for new criteria - one is that the proposed criterion should arise often. I&#39;m one of the more active CSD admins and I see maybe one of those in every 200-300 pages. Not nearly enough to warrant a new criterion.

<p>I rarely nominate articles for deletion. (I prefer to close them) but when I do, it&#39;s usually articles in the hoax/madeup class such as <a class="externallink" href="http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Sand_Frizzle_(deleted_06_Sep_2008_at_23:14)" rel="nofollow" title="http://deletionpedia.dbatley.com/w/index.php?title=Sand_Frizzle_(deleted_06_Sep_2008_at_23:14)">this one</a> (<a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Sand Frizzle">afd)</a>. Such articles are completely unverifiable but not necessarily hoaxes so they don&#39;t qualify for CSD G3. These need to go to AFD just to make sure that nobody else can verify them either. However, I see no problem with snow closing such AFDs once enough people chime in and say they found zilch. --<a href="" title="User:Ron Ritzman">Ron Ritzman</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ron Ritzman">talk</a>) 13:33, 11 June 2009 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Occasionally I&#39;ll speedy an article as <a href="" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> if it doesn&#39;t fit any of the criteria but it&#39;s patent crap, eg &#34;Snookerdiddle is a nickname for my friend Sarah, after she said this in her sleep at a slumber party last night&#34; etc. Some articles like this don&#39;t fit the CSD criteria but nobody would contest deleting them. <i>The problem</i> with adding <a href="" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> (or anything like it) to the CSD policy is that the CSD policy is interpreted bureaucratically, so you have to have strict scrutiny about anything you add to it. As such I&#39;m inclined to say no, leave it out, and let admins like me take risks for ourselves by invoking IAR to speedy delete this kind of stuff. <a href="" title="User:causa sui">&#60;small&#62;⟳&#60;/small&#62;ausa کui</a> <a href="" title="User talk:causa sui">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;b&#62;×&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 17:30, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>I think simply making <a href="" title="WP:MADEUP">WP:MADEUP</a> a speedy delete category is far too broad a proposal. I do think (and this seems to be the intention) that there should be a CSD for things that are <i>unambiguously non-notable neologisms</i>. Many entries of this type affirm their own lack of notability in the entry (&#34;me and my mates made this up at the bar last week&#34;). G3 rarely applies in these cases, G3 is for &#34;blatant and obvious misinformation&#34; and &#34;blatant hoaxes&#34;: if it really is an invented phrase used by 2 or 3 people, then it&#39;s neither a hoax nor misinformation. And <a href="" title="WP:NFT">WP:NFT</a> isn&#39;t a speedy delete category. These types of entries either sit around for a week, or get shoehorned into non-applicable speedy delete categories, both less than ideal solutions. <a href="" title="User:Hairhorn">Hairhorn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hairhorn">talk</a>) 17:57, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>As I suggested above, sometimes the best thing to do in these cases is speedy the article out of process. I try to make clear in the summary that it&#39;s an out of process/IAR deletion, and it&#39;s better than claiming the article fits some other CSD criteria that it obviously doesn&#39;t. <a href="" title="User:causa sui">&#60;small&#62;⟳&#60;/small&#62;ausa کui</a> <a href="" title="User talk:causa sui">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;b&#62;×&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 20:16, 17 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

I was, of course, only referring to actual &#34;authorized&#34; archives not just random copies people had made.

<dd>To my knowledge there have been no court decisions dealing with this sort of archiving service. It is at least arguably a copyright violation - opt-out isn&#39;t sure to cure the copying. (What if I decided, I&#39;m going to make copies of every CD my friends own, unless I hear from the record company in advance specifically I can&#39;t copy that one? Probably not going to cut it with the RIAA.) Nothing really makes these services &#34;authorized&#34; - yes, they respect robots.txt but that may not be the end of it. Since it&#39;s at least arguably a fair use, though, and it&#39;s quite useful, I think we should continue to use them.

<dd>Authorized was in quotes for a reason. :)  There has been at least one court case specifically about internet archiving, although I don&#39;t recall the details off hand.  The ruling was basically if a site doesn&#39;t use any method to say they don&#39;t want their content archived they are implicitly allowing it.  They key for archive.org/webcitation.org is that they are acting as a &#34;library&#34; of sorts - this grants them leeway that wouldn&#39;t be granted to a for-profit company.   This isn&#39;t really a new issue as regular libraries have been archiving resources for decades without explicit permission, and have occasionally had to defend the practice in court. --<a href="" title="User:ThaddeusB">ThaddeusB</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:ThaddeusB">talk</a>) 20:47, 17 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Perhaps it might best to state that he was the first player to cross the baseball color line? Since that is what the &#34;black/African American&#34; thing is driving at. My point is, if the reason for saying something it is to describe their citizenship and lineage then African American is fine, but if it is to point out that they are notable for being a &#34;black-something&#34; (first black baseball player, first black president), I don&#39;t think we should water the statement down by expanding it to a lineage-citizenship statement. –&#60;font face=&#34;verdana&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="user:xeno"><b>xeno</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34; face=&#34;verdana&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;talk&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 23:53, 14 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed. This was an issue in the examples I linked above.

Here&#39;s my bottom line: a term that has been in an article for some time has implicitly been vetted by the article&#39;s editors and readers.

<dd>Ok, other than maybe Wesley Snipes, how many people out there actually have BLACK skin color. Why are some thinking this term is somehow just as accurate as African-American. I&#39;m disregarding the whole &#34;well, some articles are using African-American for those that are not Americans in the first place&#34; because that has nothing to do with this topic- whether or not to use Black or African-American for those American citizens of African descent. I&#39;m also going to ignore the whole matter of what is used in Barack Obama&#39;s article because first- not a descendant of slaves like most African-Americans/Blacks in the US, second- his father really was AFRICAN and was not an African-American therefore you <i>cant</i> call Pres. Obama &#34;half African-American&#34; but you <i>can</i> call him &#34;half African&#34; or &#34;half Black&#34;, third- Barack Obama is half-white which seems to get forgotten with all this talk of &#34;first Black POTUS&#34;, he&#39;s also a Scots-Irish president and there&#39;s been more than 20 of those but is that notable? Which brings the question: O.K. those who prefer &#34;Black&#34; over African-American- what do you propose to use for &#34;White&#34; people, should we throw out Irish-American, Italian-American, and other terms and just use White from now on? Let&#39;s go and call Latinos &#34;Brown&#34; and Chinese as &#34;Yellow&#34; while we are at it, see how now the comment by the user that using Black is not being shy about racism now looks racist. How about we use terms used by the individual themselves. If Barack Obama were to call himself a &#34;Purple-American&#34; then we should use that term for him, and I believe Tiger Woods uses Blasian or something like that. Let&#39;s not label people or call them &#34;black&#34; &#34;white&#34; or whatever AT ALL unless heritage is notable in which case mention directly that &#34;grandpa is from x country&#34; or whatever. A Black person&#39;s article doesnt HAVE to mention at all that they are Black and in my opinion SHOULDNT because in 90% of the articles on African-Americans it is not notable that they are Black. Mike Tyson being African-American is not notable so why should it be mentioned in his article? Does Dick Cheney&#39;s article mention that he&#39;s White?<a href="" title="User:Camelbinky">Camelbinky</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Camelbinky">talk</a>) 01:12, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you partly. One thing I&#39;ve been wondering is: how many generations back does a black person need to have  American before they become &#34;black American&#34; (or, better  &#34;American&#34;) rather than &#34;African American&#34;. It just seems peculiar to me. Canada is so multicultural we rarely see on strict lineage bases like this. We&#39;re just all Canadian.

<dd>First off, Xeno, I dont understand your comment about &#34;how far back before they are American&#34;, if someone is born in the United States or if one or both parents was an American citizen then they are an American citizen, if they are black then they would be an African-American, if that is the term they prefer. Second- really you need to quit the ultra-nationalistic Canada crap. Your country doesnt have a great record on race relations like you are making it seem, read some history on how your country treated Asian immigrants. It is alot easier to have good &#34;race relations&#34; in a country that historically didnt let many into it in the first place. Your nation is 80% of European descent and has only 2.5% of African descent (Black) with no minority group over 4% of the population, compared to the United States of with 13% Black, 4.4% Asian as the two largest RACIAL groups and Hispanics of any race at 15.1% the largest ETHNIC group. So exactly how is Canada &#34;so multicultural&#34; as you put it, when you have only one culture? It&#39;s like saying the Japanese are multicultural and have no racism because everyone in Japan is Japanese. Americans are all Americans regardless of race or ethnic status and you seem to be saying we dont see people as Americans because we do recognize race or ethnicity. Recognizing race is not the same as racism and it has no bearing on nationality.<a href="" title="User:Camelbinky">Camelbinky</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Camelbinky">talk</a>) 01:46, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>My point is that if a person&#39;s notability is partly derived from the fact that they are <i>not-white</i>, we shouldn&#39;t then use a lineage-citizenship construction (can&#39;t there be white African Americans?) to tiptoe around the fact that they are, in fact, <i>black</i>. Why not just come out and say it? Why beat around the bush? Racism and racial lines exist, let&#39;s not pretend that they don&#39;t and remember that this is the English Wikipedia.

<dd>The percentages are from <a href="" title="Canada">Canada</a>, and while using Wikipedia as a reference is not acceptable for articles I see no reason not use our own article as a reference for a discusion page. Trust me, your country is not much a melting pot compared to the US, even on a city to city comparision check <a href="" title="Toronto">Toronto</a> versus <a href="" title="New York City">New York City</a> or not even on such a primary city to primary city comparision check Toronto 8% Black versus tiny <a href="" title="Albany, New York">Albany, New York</a> with over 30% Black, so saying Canada is race-equal and the US isnt is ridiculous its comparing apples and oranges, there isnt a part of Canada with as high of a concentration of minorities mixed with whites (we arent counting natives to North America, even then Canada has a bad history dealing with those), and to make the US seem a racist country and Canada not is equally ignorant. The US has its problems, you throw so many different groups that are equally proud of their heritage together in tight quarters and that will happen. If the people of California could be spread out over the size of Canada then sure crime and incidences of racism would go down to the level of Canada&#39;s and vice versa if the people of Canada were to be crammed into the area of California then racism and violence would go up to the level of California&#39;s.

<dd>I guess I STILL dont understand how using &#34;African-American&#34; instead of &#34;Black&#34; is in your words &#34;tip-toe(ing) around that fact&#34; of the US electing a Black president. Does using the word African-American in your opinion tiptoe around his skin color? And again for clarification- he is half black and half white so NO the US <b>still</b> hasnt elected a Black president or even elected a president decended from a slave so he&#39;s not the first &#34;Black President&#34;, and even if he were 100% African-American descended from the very first two slaves on American soil, so what? He was elected due to his merits, ideas, ideals, beliefs, proposals, hard-work, dedicated service to the American people, his compassion, and his ability to connect with the voters. Are you saying that being Black is somehow relevant to how he got elected, relevant to how he performs his duties as POTUS, or relevant in any way other than he has darker skin? He is the President of the United States, I dont see how mentioning his skin color is relevant to the article. Being half-black shouldnt matter. Those who find it necessary to point out race in things like &#34;the first black X&#34; are those that are holding back racial equality more than those who just say &#34;um, ok, so?&#34; and couldnt care less about mentioning race or ethnicity. I guess the questions I have for you are the following- &#34;what in your opinion is the difference between saying Black or African-American?, what do those words mean to <b>you</b>? and most importantly- isnt what those words mean to Barack Obama (or whomever the article is about) matter MOST and the term that person uses about themselves matter more than your attempt at political correctness?&#34;<a href="" title="User:Camelbinky">Camelbinky</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Camelbinky">talk</a>) 08:31, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Speaking as a US citizen who has little experience with racism, this has been an enlightening discussion.  I especially appreciated Mooriddengirl&#39;s concise summary.  To this I can only add the comment that racism appears to be an issue with a wide disparity of interests.  One is either immensely interested in it, or easily bored with it.  I&#39;m usually bored with it, but Mooriddengirl&#39;s contribution was enlightening.  If there were ever a wikipolicy drafted, it would certainly be distracting and require much attention from administrators, draining their valuable time.  The less said, the better, I think.  <a href="" title="User:Danglingdiagnosis">Danglingdiagnosis</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Danglingdiagnosis">talk</a>) 16:00, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The quote above illustrates the issue rather well, because it is <i>exactly</i> POV editing. It reveals that the edit was not made to make the article better, but to express an opinion on an issue that is not directly related (&#34;white&#34; vs. &#34;African American&#34; in this case). Political correctness has no relevance for encyclopaedic editing. There&#39;s a principle that can be derived: if the edit wasn&#39;t made to directly improve the article, it should be undone.

<dd>Sometimes being overly PC can get you into trouble.  When my brother joined the US Navy back in the early 80s, they had a question on the application form that was obviously designed to ask about race and ethnic background... but the Navy could not be so blunt, so they used the term &#34;Ancestry&#34;.  After thinking about this a bit, my brother put down &#34;American&#34;.  He got a call from the Navy a few weeks later, to the effect that: &#34;Yes, yes, we are all Americans... we want to know where do you come from?&#34;</dd>
<dd>&#34;New York&#34;, said my brother.  </dd>
<dd>&#34;OK, where did your Parents come from?&#34;</dd>
<dd>&#34;New York&#34;</dd>
<dd>&#34;OK what about your Grand Parents?&#34;</dd>
<dd>&#34;New York... Sigh, look I don&#39;t mean to be difficult, but I have ancestors on both sides of my family that have been in America since the 1600s...on my Mother&#39;s side they go back to when New York was named New Amsterdam, and  my Father&#39;s family moved here from England shortly after Plymoth Rock.  How many generations do you have to live in this country before you can drop the hyphenation?&#34;</dd>
<dd>&#34;OK we&#39;ll put down &#39;English&#39;&#34;</dd>
<dd>My brother didn&#39;t bother arguing... although he could have pointed out that he had just as much, if not more Dutch, French, Irish and Scottish ancestry as English.  It was obvious that what they <i>really</i> wanted to ask was: &#34;Are you a minority? (thus qualifying for special programs)&#34; but they felt that this would be too insensitive. <a href="" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Blueboar">talk</a>) 18:53, 15 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Capitalization_of_article_titles_etc._should_be_changed">Capitalization of article titles etc. should be changed</span></h2>

<p>The Wikipedia style manual favors capitalizing the first word of article titles, along with section heads and other occurences when it is the first word.  I think the style should be changed so that, as in a standard dictionary (eg, Merriam-Webster Collegiate), the article title is only capitalized if the word is generally capitalized.  </p>
<p>This is guidance for the user, and the prevalence of capitalization in Wiki articles can be misleading.</p>
<p>A good example is the article on brucellosis.  The word occurs nine times in the title, first paragraph, table of contents, and illustration box, and because it is the first word in those heads or sentences, it is capitalized all nine times--a strong visual hint to the user that the word is properly capitalized.  But brucellosis should not be capitalized, and there is some lowercasing even of the genus name, Brucella.</p>
<p>It used to be that computers sort alphabetically by ASCII so that lower case words were listed before capitalized ones.  But I&#39;m sure Wikipedia&#39;s software now can handle a mixture of titles in lc or uc.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Paid_Editing_proposal:__Wikipedia_.26quot.3Btax.26quot.3B_on_paid_editors.3F">Paid Editing proposal:  Wikipedia &#34;tax&#34; on paid editors?</span></h2>

<p> 
I have been following and contributing to the long discussion at <a href="" title="Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Paid_editing">Wikipedia_talk:Requests_for_comment/Paid_editing</a>.  Since that page is pretty much saturated and coming to an end, I decided to post this one proposal here to gague the community&#39;s views on it.  Pardon me if this is out of place, but like I said, the RFC is gargantuan and an idea like this would likely get drowned out in all the cross posting.</p>
<p>If paid editing is allowed on Wikipedia, a &#34;tax&#34; on the money changing hands would serve to 1) decrease the likelihood of abuse of the system by discouraging the payment of large amounts of money to editors, 2) make it more expensive for those seeking to use paid editors, and of course, 3) generate money for the Wikimedia foundation.  Individuals accepting money in exhange for their &#34;services&#34; in editing wikipedia will be required to pay a percentage of their fees to the Wikipedia foundation, akin to a tax.  In order to make things fair and to discourage the abuse inherent in companies paying large amounts of money to certain influential editors, a progressive tax system is necessary.  A proposed &#34;tax&#34; table on paid editors might be something like:</p>

<ul>
<li>For the first $1-$250 in fees, the user pays 15% to the Wikimedia foundation,</li>
<li>For the amount between $251-500, the user must pay 18%,</li>
<li>For the amount between $501-1,000, the user must pay 20%,</li>
<li>For the amount between $1,001-2,500, the user must pay 25%,</li>
<li>For the amount between $2,501-5,000, the user must pay 32%,</li>
<li>For the amount between $5,001-10,000, the user must pay 50%,</li>
<li>For the amount over $10,001, the user must pay 75%.</li></ul>

<p>This system would generate substantial revenues for Wikipedia and also would make editors a little more hestitant to engage in paid editing.  Please give me some feedback as I think this idea might go somewhere.  <a href="" title="User:Erich Mendacio">Erich Mendacio</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Erich Mendacio">talk</a>) 02:27, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Sounds unenforceable to me. We only know when people are being paid if they tell us. If they would be charged a &#34;tax&#34;, they would not be inclined to be honest. That would prevent us from monitoring their edits to ensure they don&#39;t introduce a bias to articles. You also have problems with calculating the fees - what do you do with people who edit Wikipedia as part of the their job, but not exclusively? (Your proposed tax rates are also far too high. See <a href="" title="Laffer curve">Laffer curve</a> - if you have too high a tax rate you get less revenue.) --<a href="" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Tango">talk</a>) 02:41, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

<p>The Laffer Curve is only infalliable to the likes of Alex Keaton from Family Ties.  Furthermore, part of the intent of this tax system is to discourage large amounts of money being injected into the editorial process, not just to raise revenue. <a href="" title="User:Erich Mendacio">Erich Mendacio</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Erich Mendacio">talk</a>) 02:58, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I have no idea who Alex Keaton is, but the basic principle behind the Laffer Curve is generally accepted. There is disagreement on where the peak is, but a 75% tax rate on anything over $10,001 (and that is on top of regular taxes) is almost certainly going to be on the right hand side of the curve. Revenues don&#39;t only reduce due to reduced productivity, they also reduce due to workers going underground, as I mentioned. --<a href="" title="User:Tango">Tango</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Tango">talk</a>) 03:05, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>(e/c)A few comments. 1) I agree with Tango, this would likely have the opposite effect. Any social incentive to reveal the fact that you&#39;re editing for pay is going to be canceled out by the monetary incentive to hide the fact. 2) I also agree that its unenforceable. Real taxes work because if you don&#39;t pay them you have pay even more in fines and interest and/or go to prison. The foundation might be able to change the terms of use for the site, but IANAL, I don&#39;t know if that would hold up in court. 3) This, intentionally or not, gives the impression that people can just pay off the foundation to look the other way. Lots of people, including the media sometimes, don&#39;t know how Wikipedia really works; they see people paying money to the WMF for the ability to pay people to edit for them, it won&#39;t look good. &#60;font face=&#34;Broadway&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.</a><a href="" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man"><b><i>Z-</i></b><i>man</i></a>&#60;/font&#62; 03:10, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

<p><b>Enforcement</b>:  Enforcement of this tax system is easier that you all think, and it would still respect the anonymity and privacy of the editors who choose to accept payment for edits.  This is how:  All entities who wish to pay Wikipedians to edit would be required to register with the Foundation.  These &#34;payors&#34; would be required to report how much they are paying to each Wikipedian username, and for what edits.  The payors (not the editors/payees) would be required to deposit the requisite &#34;tax&#34; sums to the Foundation.  Any entity found to be untruthful concerning their payments, not registering with the Foundation in the first place, or paying editors &#34;under the table&#34; would be barred from Foundation projects forever.  </p>
<p>Placing the burden on the <i>payors</i> rather than the paid editors vastly simplifies enforcement of the tax, and makes it easy for Wikipedia to track which edits were &#34;paid edits,&#34; so that the community can double check those edits for bias and non-compliance with policies. <a href="" title="User:Erich Mendacio">Erich Mendacio</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Erich Mendacio">talk</a>) 03:34, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>An example:  The XYZABC Corporation has an agreement with <a href="" title="User:Tango">User:Tango</a> for the user to create a stub article on &#34;Whale Chips&#34; for $5500 USD.  The XYZABC Corporation registers its name, corporate agent, and some other minor contact information with the Wikipedia Foundation.  Then the XYZABC Inc reports the terms of its agreement with <a href="" title="User:Tango">User:Tango</a> on a new page created for such public announcements, such as <a href="" title="WP:Paid Editing Agreements/Current">WP:Paid Editing Agreements/Current</a>.  The corporation, after the editor had completed his task, would forward payment of $1607.50 to the wikimedia foundation (the tax as calculated pursuant to the table above), and  then pay $3892.50 ($5500-1607.50) to <a href="" title="User:Tango">User:Tango</a> in whatever manner they agree.  This system keeps the editor anonymous, collects the tax cleanly, and this whole procees is open to scrutiny by the wikipedia community. <a href="" title="User:Erich Mendacio">Erich Mendacio</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Erich Mendacio">talk</a>) 03:46, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, since no one ever allows <a href="" title="working under the table">working under the table</a> to avoid paying taxes and such, and they would be even <i>less</i> likely to do so when there is no penalty of law to enforce it. <a href="" title="User:Anomie">Anomie</a><a href="" title="User talk:Anomie">⚔</a> 04:34, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Placing the burden on the payors makes it even less enforceable. If the burden is on the payee, there could be changes to the site&#39;s terms of use that would require people to pay the tax (how legally enforceable it would be is questionable, it would certainly be hard to prove cheaply, we&#39;d have to file a lawsuit and subpoena financial records) but the terms of use are not binding on people who aren&#39;t actually using the site. Being banned from Wikipedia is hardly a punishment. If I had a choice between being banned and paying several thousand dollars, I think I&#39;d chose the former. Especially as I know how difficult a ban is to enforce. &#60;font face=&#34;Broadway&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.</a><a href="" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man"><b><i>Z-</i></b><i>man</i></a>&#60;/font&#62; 05:07, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></li></ul>

<p>The challenge with paid editing is that by its nature, it creates a conflict of interest.  While that is not automatically a bar against editing, to tax a paid editor would be tantamount to Wikipedia endorsing that conflict of interest.   As a project we could hardly call ourselves neutral if we adopted such a plan. <a href="" title="User:Resolute">Reso</a><a href="" title="User Talk:Resolute">lute</a> 04:50, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>Sir, I agree!  Thats probably why we should keep paid editing prohibited!  But my plan is a realistic way to make paid editing less prevalent and costlier IF and WHEN paid editing is allowed.  A substantial number of editors and admins seem to think its right around the corner.  Wikipedia would be seen as ratifying the COI even by allowing the previously-banned paid editing.  But if Wikipedia reverses course and allows it, why not make it a bit more onerous and costly to engage in it while making money for the foundation at the same time? <a href="" title="User:Erich Mendacio">Erich Mendacio</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Erich Mendacio">talk</a>) 04:54, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Legitimizing paid editing as a means of defeating it seems likely to become an idealistic failure.  A tax is unenforceable, so while you propose this with good intentions, it is not likely to have a material impact. While the recent controversy has spurred a lot of discussion which I have duly ignored, I would bet it is only the tip of the iceberg.  Rather than create new policies and taxes, we should trust in the existing policies.  As a matter of routine, we clean up promotional edits and articles.  Most people looking for a glowing Wikipedia article will discover one of two things: either there is very little interest in them, or there is enough interest that the community won&#39;t let the promotional editing stand.  Either way, they are wasting their money.  Let the system as it stands sort this kind of editing out. <a href="" title="User:Resolute">Reso</a><a href="" title="User Talk:Resolute">lute</a> 05:07, 21 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Indeed.  The only means of dealing with an editor who doesn&#39;t pay his tax is to block him.  As a block will not lead to payment, a tax is unenforceable.  Or do you propose the foundation sic Mike Godwin after non-payors? <a href="" title="User:Resolute">Reso</a><a href="" title="User Talk:Resolute">lute</a> 05:23, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>If the editor is blocked that means his future profitability from selling his services is destroyed.  An editor&#39;s weight on Wikipedia has a lot to do with reputation and past history, so an editor with a good reputation would have an incentive to play by the rules and declare his earnings accurately to avoid being blocked, and thus to continue to make money selling his edits.  </p>
<p>However, my proposal is to make the payors have to declare the payments and pay the tax on them.  This would make evasion less of an issue, since the payors would be paying the same amount (the gross) even if they chose to do it underhandedly (under the table)(see my example above). <a href="" title="User:Erich Mendacio">Erich Mendacio</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Erich Mendacio">talk</a>) 05:43, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>The nature of a progressive tax is that the tax rates only apply to the amount <i>over</i> the bottom figure in the bracket.  The 75% rate only applies to the amount over $10,000, not to the whole sum.  Furthermore, under this proposal you wouldn&#39;t have the choice not to pay...the payor would forward the tax to the Wikipedia foundation at the same time he paid you the net sum minus the contribution (tax).

<dd>You seem to have some confusion over the difference between &#34;implementation&#34; and &#34;enforcement&#34;. You&#39;ve described how you would implement the policy, you haven&#39;t described how you would enforce it. How would you deal with people not following it? You also have some confusion over the economics of the situation - it makes no difference who pays the tax. An editor will decide whether or not to accept the job based on how much they would actually be able to spend. If they decide that they need to receive $100 to make it worth their while then in one scenario their employer will have to pay them $100 and pay the WMF $15 and in the other they would pay the editor $118 and have him pay the WMF $18. (The $3 difference is due to a difference in that the tax is 15% of, but that isn&#39;t important - you can just alter the tax rate in one scenario to make them the same.)

<dd>Enforcement is impractical, you can&#39;t easily <b>ban</b> payors, because they&#39;ll just find editors willing to work for them who won&#39;t report to the foundation.  Also.. where do employees (like research professors) who <i>are paid</i>, but also experts in a technical subject fit in.   Now if they want to make a positive contribution to an article for the benefit of community (during work hours paid by their  institution), they have to get the university/research institute to pay the wikimedia foundration (and get a trifle back) instead of getting their normal salary? That would discourage positive activities..</dd>

<p><b>Oppose</b> First, it is premature to be talking about taxing a practice that Wikipedia policy does not condone. Second, Wikipedia has no legal authority to do this.

<p>Not sure if this subject has been covered before: apologies if it has, but I can&#39;t find it anywhere. Is there a WP policy on referring to female theatre and film performers as actresses, rather than actors? The WP page on <a href="#Terminology" title="Actor">actors</a> is fairly vague on it, but I&#39;m aware of several professionals, such as <a href="" title="Miriam Margolyes">Miriam Margolyes</a>, who are fairly vociferous about calling themselves actors, and it seems a bit contrary for WP editors to describe them as actresses. I shan&#39;t write out the whole debate which underpins it as I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;re all familiar with it, but I do think it would be useful to have some guidance on these pages  <a href="" title="User:Dom Kaos">Dom Kaos</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dom Kaos">talk</a>) 21:35, 18 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>From memory it has been discussed (I can&#39;t remember where) and the conclusion was that if there is a source for the subject having a preference (and I know people who are insistent on being called &#39;actress&#39;) then we respect the subject&#39;s preference. For someone active prior to 1960 I would probably default to actress, as that was the dominant usage of the period. Other than that, don&#39;t mess with what the first significant author wrote so long as the article is consistent (much the same as similar policies on language variants). <a href="" title="User:Dramatic">dramatic</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dramatic">talk</a>) 09:20, 20 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Should we respect that though, just because they prefer it? I mean, if other sources do, then yes, but consider a similar case like <a href="" title="Claude Debussy">Claude Debussy</a> who is pretty much universally considered an impressionist composer, but he hated the term.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Freedom.3F">Freedom?</span></h2>

<p>I just finished watching a PBS documentary on Wikipedia, where it was emphasized how Wikipedia is different from classic encyclopedias/encyclopediae in that ordinary persons from around the world can share, rather than just contributors from &#34;authorized&#34; sources approved by The Establishment.</p>
<p>Imagine my surprise (and sorrow) as I sought to add a paragraph to a current article, listing my source as my posting in a forum on another legitimate website (I gave the external link), and being told in an error message that forums were not acceptable as sources for submissions, only published materials from established entities were.</p>
<p>I remember in the past reading statements in articles that listed as a &#34;footnote&#34; something to the effect of &#34;citation needed,&#34; and many of the submissions were opinions of individuals rather than official published statements of approved groups.</p>

Somehow those feel like too much, but I agree with Dream Guy that we should reference, in broad strokes, most everything we can.  For fiction, I&#39;m not sure what the best way is to reference plot.  For major works we could also reference secondary sources (say Cliff Notes or reviews) for plot, but that also feels wrong.  I think an RfC on the topic would be a good idea frankly.
