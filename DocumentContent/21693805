Peeballs are biodegradable compacted-powder balls that can be collected, or placed in gentlemen&#39;s urinals and destroyed using the power of the urinary stream. Peeball is available in many retail outlets including the <a href="" title="Mitchells &amp;amp; Butlers">Mitchells &#38; Butlers</a> and <a href="" title="Scottish &amp;amp; Newcastle">Scottish &#38; Newcastle</a> pub chains, <a href="" title="Virgin Megastores">Virgin Megastores</a>, <a href="" title="River Island">River Island</a>, <a href="" title="Maplin Electronics">Maplin</a> and <a href="" title="Ryman">Ryman</a>, and via the web. In the UK, Peeballs cost £1.00 with at least 30p of which going directly to the Prostate Cancer Charity.</p>
<p>Peeball was conceived as &#39;a new approach to charitable awareness and fund raising – an alternative to the worthy-but-dull badges and key rings that have become the mainstay of charity in retail&#39;. It was created to engage and amuse but also to highlight issues that would never usually be discussed socially or in mainstream media. Peeball has used schoolboy humour to help communicate serious health and awareness messages. The game has been featured on national TV (on <i><a href="" title="This Morning (TV series)">This Morning</a></i>), in radio programmes (including <a href="" title="BBC Radio 1">Radio One</a>&#39;s <i><a href="" title="Mark and Lard">Mark and Lard</a></i> &#39;playing&#39; the game on air and a feature on the <a href="" title="Steve Wright (DJ)">Steve Wright</a> Show), newspapers, magazines and the local press. In addition, the Peeball on-line game has been played more than 26,000,000 times. As a result of its success in the UK – Peeball has been adopted for launch by several other national prostate cancer charities.</p>
<p>Over 500,000 Peeballs have been sold in the UK raising over £150,000 for The Prostate Cancer Charity&#60;ref name=&#34;timesonline1&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p>The &#39;Remember Me&#39; campaign  for  <a href="" title="RoadPeace">RoadPeace</a> – the UK road accident victims charity – was launched on 31 August 2003.   The &#39;Remember Me&#39; Weeping Flower sign was created by Sweetapple and given to the  charity mainly to provide a permanent memorial to lives lost or blighted through road crashes. It was also intended to provide a poignant warning to other road users regarding the everyday risks of road use.  </p>
<p>Since its launch over 3,000 Remember Me signs have been placed on Britain&#39;s roads and the Weeping Flower image has been used to front various RoadPeace campaigns. These have included projecting the image onto <a href="" title="City Hall">City Hall</a> in London and using it to highlight the connection between Safety Cameras and road deaths by <a href="" title="TfL">TfL</a>.</p>

<p><a class="externallink" href="http://www.givesure.co.uk" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.givesure.co.uk">GiveSure</a> is a UK insurance service that gives money to charity each time someone buys a policy.</p>
<p>Launched in the UK in 2006, Givesure offers car, home, van and bike insurance. Rather than doing its own underwriting, Givesure is backed by a <a href="" title="broker">broker</a>, which searches the underwriting market for competitive quotes.</p>
<p>For every policy bought or renewed through Givesure the broker makes a donation to charity of £20 or 10% of the premium, whichever is the greater. </p>
<p>Givesure is able to make the charitable donations without loading customers’ premiums. This is because it does not spend money on marketing and advertising. The money the company will save from not doing this is passed on to charity.</p>
