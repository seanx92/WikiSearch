<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pros_and_Cons">Pros and Cons</span></h3>
<p>Every Tuesday on the show, Jimmy weighs the pros and cons of a topic that&#39;s currently in the news, with the pros being the setups and the cons being the punchlines.  (e.g. Pro: With Tiger competing, this year&#39;s Masters promises to be the most exciting golf tournament ever. Con: That being said, it&#39;s still golf.) Special editions of the skit include: &#34;The reissue of the <a href="" title="Rolling Stones">Rolling Stones</a>&#39; album <i><a href="" title="Exile on Main St.">Exile on Main St.</a></i>&#34;, in which Jimmy was joined via satellite by <a href="" title="Mick Jagger">Mick Jagger</a>, <a href="" title="Keith Richards">Keith Richards</a> and <a href="" title="Charlie Watts">Charlie Watts</a>; one in which the topic was &#34;The New NFL Season&#34;, where Jimmy was joined by <a href="" title="Justin Tuck">Justin Tuck</a> of the <a href="" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a>; and &#34;The NFL Playoffs&#34; with <a href="" title="New York Jets">New York Jets</a> placekicker <a href="" title="Nick Folk">Nick Folk</a>.</p>

<p>Every Thursday (formerly Wednesday) on the show, Jimmy reads off viewer comments from a topic for discussion he started the night before on <a href="" title="Twitter">Twitter</a>. Topics have included &#34;My parents are weird&#34;, &#34;Why don&#39;t they make that?&#34;, &#34;Beach fail&#34;, and &#34;Aww hell no!&#34;</p>
<p>Jimmy later created a spinoff named &#34;Late Night <a href="" title="Instagram">Instagrams</a>&#34;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Thank_You_Notes">Thank You Notes</span></h3>
<p>Every Friday on the show, Jimmy writes thank you notes. He claims that Friday is the day he catches up on &#34;personal stuff&#34; like checking his inbox, returning e-mails, and writing his weekly thank you notes. He explains that he is running behind and asks the audience if they wouldn&#39;t mind if he took time out of the show to write them, and asks <a href="" title="James Poyser">James Poyser</a> to play some accompanying music (a sped up version of U2&#39;s &#34;<a href="" title="October (song)">October</a>&#34;). The notes are sarcastic in tone and involve current events, people in the news, or things that annoy Jimmy (e.g. &#34;Thank you, <a href="" title="pony tail">pony tails</a>, for turning the backs of girls&#39; heads into horses&#39; butts.&#34;). </p>
<p>The sketch airs on Thursday during the week of <a href="" title="Thanksgiving (United States)">Thanksgiving</a> in deference to the holiday.</p>
<p>Jimmy also wrote out a special <a href="" title="2010 Winter Olympics">Winter Olympics</a>-themed set of thank you notes during <a href="" title="NBC">NBC</a>&#39;s prime-time Olympic coverage on February 26, 2010 (a Friday); anchor <a href="" title="Bob Costas">Bob Costas</a> &#34;played&#34; the usual thank you note-writing music (by pretending to play along on a keyboard while a pre-recorded track of the music played in the background).  Costas and Jimmy reprised the bit with a <a href="" title="2012 Summer Olympics">Summer Olympics</a>-themed set on August 10, 2012 (also a Friday).</p>
<p>It was announced on January 31, 2011 that Fallon had signed a book deal to publish entries from the series as two books, the first of which, <i>Thank You Notes</i>, was released May 23, 2011.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; The sequel, <i>Thank You Notes 2</i>, was released on May 22, 2012.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;  The new book also has a limited edition which has a sound chip that plays the &#34;Thank You Notes&#34; theme music (to which Jimmy replies &#34;We don&#39;t even need James Poyser any more&#34;, then the camera cuts to Poyser looking depressed).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Former_weekly_sketches">Former weekly sketches</span></h3>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Remix_the_Clips">Remix the Clips</span></h4>
<p>On Thursdays, Jimmy showed a few short viral video clips from recent TV shows and <a href="" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>, then asked <a href="" title="Questlove">Questlove</a> to create a short <a href="" title="remix">remix</a> combining parts of all the videos.  This sketch has seemingly been retired.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="7th_Floor_West"><i>7th Floor West</i></span></h3>
<p>A parody of the <a href="" title="MTV">MTV</a> series <i><a href="" title="The Hills">The Hills</a></i>, documenting Jimmy&#39;s arrival to <i>Late Night</i> and his initial struggles in the beginning of the show, such as whether to wear a red tie or a blue tie on his premiere episode.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/clips/7th-floor-west-part-1-3509/1055381/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/video/clips/7th-floor-west-part-1-3509/1055381/">NBC.com - Late Night with Jimmy Fallon - 7th Floor West Episode 1, Part 1</a>&#60;/ref&#62;  Season 1 of the series dealt with Jimmy&#39;s passive-aggressive power struggle with <a href="" title="A.D. Miles">Miles</a>, <i>Late Night<b>s head writer.  Future <i>Saturday Night Live</i> cast member <a href="" title="Jenny Slate">Jenny Slate</a> appeared as Jimmy&#39;s assistant who betrayed his trust by collaborating with Miles. New installments premiered every Monday during the summer of 2009, and have a storyline focused on continuity, much as <i>The Hills</i> does.  </b></i></p>
<p>Season 2 finds Miles, having moved to the costume department in the season 1 finale, unhappy with his new role and wishing he was back among the writing staff.  As revenge, he dresses Jimmy in ridiculous clothes in order to make Jimmy look like an idiot.  During the season, Jimmy and Miles both run for the position of fire warden of the floor. In the series finale, Jimmy and Miles decide to end their silly feud and be friends again, Jimmy gives Miles his job in the writing department back, and they appointed fire-safety enthusiast <a href="" title="Questlove">Questlove</a> to be fire warden.</p>

<p><i>Real Housewives of Late Night</i> is a recurring parody of the various <i><a href="" title="The Real Housewives of...">The Real Housewives of...</a></i> reality shows with 5 cast members playing the roles of their fictional &#34;wives&#34;.

Each segment continues from the last in an overarching story similar to <i>7th Floor West</i>. The plot revolves around alliances and over-the-top rivalries between the characters resulting in exaggerated responses by the characters.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/real-housewives-of-late-night/&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/real-housewives-of-late-night/&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.latenightwithjimmyfallon.com/real-housewives-of-late-night/&#60;/ref&#62;</a> <i><a href="#Fourth_hour" title="Today (U.S. TV program)">Today Show&#39;s Fourth Hour</a></i> hosts <a href="" title="Kathy Lee Gifford">Kathy Lee Gifford</a> and <a href="" title="Hoda Kotb">Hoda Kotb</a> appeared on the set of their show during one episode.</p>

During the episode, Denise inadvertently started a fight with the Colts wives when she mistakenly congratulated the Colts on making the Super Bowl (thinking the game was played at one of the teams&#39; home stadium), and was informed they were actually the league&#39;s worst team that season, with their <a href="" title="2011 Indianapolis Colts season">2-14 record</a>. This caused Denise and Yvonne to quickly resolve their differences and unite against the Colts wives, causing the <i>Late Night</i> wives to win the brawl.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Steel_Channel_shows">Steel Channel shows</span></h3>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ultimate_Mustache_Fighter">Ultimate Mustache Fighter</span></h4>
<p>Jimmy and Steve Higgins play fight commentators Brock Leonard and &#34;The Professor&#34; Barry Star on NBC&#39;s &#34;sister network&#34;, the (fictitious) Steel Channel (a parody of <a href="" title="Spike (TV channel)">Spike</a>).  The fight (or as Steel Channel calls them &#34;Stache Bash&#34; with a number and unique name for each one) takes place in an octagonal cage similar to that used for <a href="" title="Ultimate Fighting Championship">UFC</a> bouts, with actual UFC referee and a bikini clad <a href="" title="ring girl">ring girl</a>.  Competitors thus far include the mustaches of <a href="" title="Wilford Brimley">Wilford Brimley</a>, <a href="" title="Geraldo Rivera">Geraldo Rivera</a>, <a href="" title="Gene Shalit">Gene Shalit</a>, <a href="" title="John Stossel">John Stossel</a>, <a href="" title="Carlos Santana">Carlos Santana</a>, &#34;&#39;80s <a href="" title="Larry Bird">Larry Bird</a>&#34; (which also did a run-in), &#34;&#39;70s <a href="" title="Burt Reynolds">Burt Reynolds</a>&#34;, &#34;&#39;80s <a href="" title="Tom Selleck">Tom Selleck</a>&#34;, &#34;&#39;80s <a href="" title="John Oates">John Oates</a>&#34;, <a href="" title="Phil McGraw">Dr. Phil</a>,  <a href="" title="Albert Einstein">Albert Einstein</a>, <a href="" title="Lionel Richie">Lionel Richie</a>, <a href="" title="Herman Cain">Herman Cain</a> and <a href="" title="Mario">Super Mario</a> (with <a href="#R" title="List of professional wrestling terms">run-ins</a> by &#34;&#39;70s <a href="" title="David Crosby">David Crosby</a>&#34; (covered in a <a href="" title="cocaine">white powder</a>), what was originally thought to be <a href="" title="Charlie Chaplin">Charlie Chaplin</a>&#39;s mustache that turned out to actually be the mustache of <a href="" title="Adolf Hitler">Adolf Hitler</a>, &#34;&#39;80s <a href="" title="Julius Erving">Dr. J</a>&#34;, and &#34;The Masked Mustache&#34; (wearing a <a href="" title="lucha libre">luchador</a>-style mask, whose identity was revealed during the <i>Detective Jam Face</i> ad)).  The most recent bout was <a href="" title="Ron Swanson">Ron Swanson</a> vs. <a href="" title="Yosemite Sam">Yosemite Sam</a> with run-ins by Wilford Brimley and Super Mario.  (The mustache costumes are normally approximately six feet wide and completely cover the head and arms of the people inside them.)  During the fight, a <a href="" title="digital on-screen graphic">digital on-screen graphic</a> advertising a new program on the Steel Channel - usually <i>Detective Jam Face</i> (played by <a href="" title="A.D. Miles">A.D. Miles</a>), but also once <i>Mustaches on Ice</i> (a Christmas special featuring the UMF competitors performing ice skating routines) - interrupts, covering the entire screen for a few seconds.  When the ad goes away, we return to find the fight is over, with Brock and Barry proclaiming the finish a history-making event and the finishing move something they&#39;ve never seen before and will probably never see again.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Kicking_Stuff">Kicking Stuff</span></h4>
<p>Another program on the Steel Channel (&#34;from the creators of Ultimate Mustache Fighter&#34;) is <i>Kicking Stuff</i>, where a man named Jonathan (Bobby Tisdale) takes ordinary objects, places them on top of an overturned orange bucket, and then kicks them off.  After kicking the object, he points at the camera and yells &#34;Kicking stuff!&#34;</p>
<p>After showing some footage from the show, Jimmy brings out Jonathan and has him kick something live in studio.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sports_Freak-Out.21">Sports Freak-Out!</span></h4>
<p>The Steel Channel&#39;s sports report, somewhat of a parody of <i><a href="" title="SportsCenter">SportsCenter</a></i>.  Jimmy and Higgins play &#34;extreme&#34; anchors Cory van Funk and Bert Donovan, respectively.  The report consists of a few segments: &#34;Check Out This Dude&#34;, where they make fun of pictures of athletes; &#34;Point / Counterpunch&#34;, where one anchor (usually Donovan) makes an argument and the other (usually van Funk) responds by punching him in the face; and &#34;Making Terrible Things Happen With Our Minds&#34;, where video clips are intercut with close-ups of the anchors&#39; faces concentrating, and then the person in the clip has an accident. In a recent version, <a href="" title="Chris Kattan">Chris Kattan</a> appeared as a depressed skateboarding teenager who reviews monster truck shows; when the hosts got him to open up about what was bothering him (beliefs he is unloved by his father), they cut him off and finished the skit.  The sketch ends with the anchors blowing on an animal horn to summon the &#34;T-shirt yeti&#34;, who comes out and throws T-shirts into the audience.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bothered_with_Robert_Pattinson"><i>Bothered</i> with Robert Pattinson</span></h3>
<p>In this segment, Jimmy presents videos from a website (<a class="externallink" href="http://RobertIsBothered.com" rel="nofollow" title="http://RobertIsBothered.com">http://RobertIsBothered.com</a>) that <a href="" title="Robert Pattinson">Robert Pattinson</a> has set up to discuss things that bother him.  Jimmy stars as Pattinson in character as <a href="" title="Edward Cullen">Edward Cullen</a> from the <i><a href="" title="The Twilight Saga (film series)">Twilight films</a></i>.  Throughout the segment he sits in a tree and talks about what bothers him, all from the perspective of Pattinson.  Also making an appearance is a blow-up doll representing <a href="" title="Kristen Stewart">Kristen Stewart</a>.
Things bothering Robert include <a href="" title="Daniel Radcliffe">Daniel Radcliffe</a> (a competing video shows Radcliffe as <a href="" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a> - also played by Fallon - is bothered by Pattinson), <a href="" title="Shark Week">Shark Week</a>, <a href="" title="Snickers">Snickers</a> ads in magazines, Halloween costumes and candy, the novel <i><a href="" title="New Moon (book)">New Moon</a></i> and vampires in general, <a href="" title="Valentine&#39;s Day">Valentine&#39;s Day</a>, the <a href="" title="iPad">iPad</a>, and the <a href="" title="2010 FIFA World Cup">World Cup</a>.  On March 1, 2010, celebrating Jimmy&#39;s first year of hosting, the real Pattinson came on to promote the film <i><a href="" title="Remember Me (2010 film)">Remember Me</a></i>. During the sketch, he interrupted Jimmy, saying &#34;I don&#39;t talk like that!&#34; Jimmy then asked Robert how that made him feel, eventually getting him to say &#34;bothered!&#34;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Reflections_with_Justin_Bieber"><i>Reflections</i> with Justin Bieber</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy as <a href="" title="Justin Bieber">Justin Bieber</a> will sit by a reflecting pool and discuss topics that are on his mind.  He will begin by talking about his own life (his appearance on <i><a href="" title="CSI: Crime Scene Investigation">CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</a></i>, his new position as host of <i><a href="" title="Punk&#39;d">Punk&#39;d</a></i>), but then start rambling on about more serious topics, such as <a href="" title="John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories">John F. Kennedy assassination conspiracy theories</a>, the <a href="" title="subprime mortgage crisis">subprime mortgage crisis</a>, his fears that <a href="" title="Economy of the People&#39;s Republic of China">China&#39;s economy</a> will overtake that of the <a href="" title="Economy of the United States">United States</a>, and the debate over <a href="" title="human cloning">human cloning</a>. It also shows him dancing, eating snacks, and receiving phone calls from other celebrities such as President <a href="" title="Barack Obama">Obama</a>, <a href="" title="Chuck Norris">Chuck Norris</a>, and <a href="" title="Alan Greenspan">Alan Greenspan</a>.  (The real Bieber joined Jimmy-as-Bieber during the dance segments on the installment which aired the day before the release of Bieber&#39;s movie <i><a href="" title="Justin Bieber: Never Say Never">Justin Bieber: Never Say Never</a></i>.)  At the end the segment, Bieber leaves in a magical fashion, such as walking on water, opening a <a href="" title="wormhole">wormhole</a>, or transforming himself into golden retriever puppy Gary Frick from the &#34;<a href="#If_Puppies_Could_Vote" title="">If Puppies Could Vote</a>&#34; sketch.</p>
<p>After the November 2011 paternity rumors involving Bieber, Jimmy-as-Bieber came on the show and performed his new song, &#34;(It&#39;s Not My) <a href="" title="Baby (Justin Bieber song)">Baby</a>&#34;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Head_Swap">Head Swap</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy introduces a segment which will supposedly present images of two celebrities whose heads have been swapped through digital <a href="" title="photo manipulation">photo manipulation</a>. A &#34;Head Swap&#34; song plays, ostensibly a short introductory jingle using sing-a-long lyrics and illustrated by a series of still photos. However, the song becomes an extended narrative set in the offices of <i>Late Night</i>, depicting Jimmy asking a member of the show&#39;s graphics department to create &#34;Head Swap&#34; images. In each instance of the sketch, a different set of bizarre complications ensue, involving Jimmy in outlandish situations (such as the accidental death of a co-worker and their attempts to hide the body because the graphic artist is on parole didn&#39;t want to go back to prison for her murder; although at the end she was only unconscious) which push the actual &#34;Head Swap&#34; to a secondary issue. The conflict is eventually resolved, and only one image of a &#34;Head Swap&#34; is shown as the song ends.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Letters_Home_.2F_Letters_to_Santa">Letters Home / Letters to Santa</span></h3>
<p>Various members of the show&#39;s crew, and often one of the guests, read letters they have written to their parents in the manner of children at a summer camp.  While they are reading, an overlay of the actual letter slowly comes into view.  Lastly, Jimmy takes out some <a href="" title="parchment">parchment</a>, an <a href="" title="ink">ink</a> well, and a large <a href="" title="quill">quill</a> and proceeds to write his letter, in <a href="" title="caligraphy">caligraphy</a>, in <a href="" title="Victorian era">Victorian era</a>-style language with a voice to match.</p>
<p>During the Christmas season, the letters are written to Santa Claus instead.  In honor of the final episode of <i><a href="" title="The Oprah Winfrey Show">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a></i>, the sketch aired with letters written to <a href="" title="Oprah Winfrey">Oprah Winfrey</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_12_Days_of_Christmas_Sweaters">The 12 Days of Christmas Sweaters</span></h3>
<p>A yearly Christmas tradition on the show (according to Jimmy) is that they bring out a large board (the Countdown to Christmas Cabinet) with 12 numbered doors in the manner of an <a href="" title="Advent calendar">Advent calendar</a>.  The number of the door opened corresponds to the number of days left before the show&#39;s holiday break.  Behind each door is a stereotypical Christmas sweater.  Jimmy picks a number out of a Santa hat, and whomever in the audience has that number wins that day&#39;s sweater.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Late_Night_Stocking_Stuffers"><i>Late Night</i> Stocking Stuffers</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy gives a gift to the entire audience each day during the last week before the show&#39;s holiday break.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="New_iPhone_Apps">New iPhone Apps</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy plugs in his <a href="" title="iPhone">iPhone</a> to a monitor to show off some new applications he&#39;s discovered.  One of these apps always deals with a picture of the head of comedian <a href="" title="Paul Reiser">Paul Reiser</a> (such as &#34;ReiserTris&#34;, a <a href="" title="Tetris">Tetris</a>-like game with Reiser heads instead of the regular Tetris blocks). On a recent version, Jimmy used an app designed to locate Reiser, and it displayed &#34;I am 8 feet behind you&#34;, then Reiser did a cameo. Another recurring app is &#34;<a href="" title="Axl Rose">Axl Rose</a> Relaxation Tapes&#34;, with the <a href="" title="Guns N&#39; Roses">Guns N&#39; Roses</a> frontman (actually Jimmy) singing over relaxing sounds such as wolves howling or thunderstorms, usually ending with him yelling &#34;Take a nap!&#34;</p>
<p>The official <i>Late Night with Jimmy Fallon</i> iPhone app, released November 10, 2010, has a feature called &#34;Jimmy&#39;s Phone&#34;, which allows users to use some of the apps featured in the sketch, including &#34;Axl Rose Relaxation Tapes&#34;, &#34;<a href="" title="Moldova">Moldova</a> Y/N&#34; (which uses your phone&#39;s <a href="" title="Global Positioning System">GPS</a> to tell you whether or not you&#39;re currently in that eastern European nation), &#34;iBanana&#34; (which allows the user to virtually peel and eat a banana), &#34;Lint Brush&#34; (allowing users to virtually clean lint off themselves), &#34;Wet Cement&#34; (allowing users to virtually draw in wet cement), and &#34;Bieber yourself&#34; (allowing users to photoshop <a href="" title="Justin Bieber">Justin Bieber</a>&#39;s hair on to pictures of themselves).&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Who_Cares_Hindenburg">Who Cares <i>Hindenburg</i></span></h3>
<p>After Jimmy briefly mentions three trivial celebrity news items, he declares that the stories should be placed into the &#34;Who Cares <i>Hindenburg</i>.&#34; Steve Higgins provides new narration to the classic <a href="" title="Hindenburg Disaster Newsreel Footage">newsreel footage</a> of the destruction of the <a href="" title="zeppelin">zeppelin</a> <i><a href="" title="LZ 129 Hindenburg">LZ 129 Hindenburg</a></i> (imitating <a href="" title="Herbert Morrison (announcer)">Herbert Morrison</a>&#39;s &#34;Oh, the humanity&#34; radio narration).  The newsreel footage has had a news crawl featuring the three news items superimposed over the zeppelin to make it look like a modern <a href="" title="blimp">blimp</a>.  The new narration always ends with the exclamation &#34;Who cares?&#34;  A frequent target is <a href="" title="Fall Out Boy">Fall Out Boy</a> bassist <a href="" title="Pete Wentz">Pete Wentz</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id=".3Fuestions">?uestions</span></h3>
<p>We listen in on <a href="" title="The Roots">Roots</a> drummer <a href="" title="Questlove">?uestlove</a> as he thinks some quasi-intellectual thoughts such as &#34;what do you do when the fire escape catches on fire?&#34; or &#34;how do you throw out a trash can?&#34; (he cocks his head and looks off into the distance, nodding occasionally, as we listen to his pre-recorded narration).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Andy_Rooney">Andy Rooney</span></h3>
<p>In &#34;Post-Apocalypse Andy Rooney&#34;, Jimmy plays former <i><a href="" title="60 Minutes">60 Minutes</a></i> commentator <a href="" title="Andy Rooney">Andy Rooney</a> as he gives his thoughts about life in a world after a nuclear war and <a href="" title="zombie">zombie</a> uprising.</p>
<p>After Rooney&#39;s retirement, the sketch became &#34;What is Andy Rooney doing now?&#34;, showing how Rooney is spending his free time, (i.e. calling everyone in the phone book and ranting to anyone that will listen).</p>
<p>Jimmy stopped doing Rooney impressions after the real Rooney&#39;s death in late 2011.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Obama_Expressions">Obama Expressions</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy, claiming to be an expert on facial expressions, explains the meanings behind numerous expressions made by U.S. President <a href="" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>. The expressions are usually explained by a short phrase (such as &#34;determined yet hopeful&#34;), until the end of the segment, which features pictures from President Obama&#39;s February 2009 meeting with Canadian Prime Minister <a href="" title="Stephen Harper">Stephen Harper</a>; at this point the phrases become overly long drivel about 1980s or 1990s youth popular culture (such as <a href="" title="Bubble Bobble">Bubble Bobble</a>, <i><a href="" title="Boy Meets World">Boy Meets World</a></i>, or <a href="" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>&#39;s <a href="" title="TGIF (ABC)">TGIF programming block</a>), reminiscing over minute details about the subject.  Jimmy once did this segment with photos of <a href="" title="United States Secretary of State">Secretary of State</a> <a href="" title="Hillary Clinton">Hillary Clinton</a> in place of Obama.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="He_Said.2C_She_Said">He Said, She Said</span></h3>
<p>Somewhat similar to &#34;Obama Expressions&#34;, Jimmy shows a series of photos, each showing a man and a woman.  Jimmy then explains what the people in the photos are thinking.  The first person&#39;s thought is somewhat regular (e.g. &#34;I&#39;m feeding him!  This is so romantic!&#34; for a picture of a wife feeding her husband) while their partner&#39;s thought is a humorous rejoinder (e.g. &#34;She&#39;s feeding me!  This is so humiliating!&#34;).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Animal_Thoughts">Animal Thoughts</span></h3>

<p>Similar to He Said, She Said, photos of people with their pets are shown, with the pets&#39; thoughts being the punchlines.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Speech_Timeline">Speech Timeline</span></h3>
<p>Often after a speech by President Obama, Jimmy will give a timeline of events, starting with actual statements from the speech.  The bit will eventually introduce Vice President <a href="" title="Joe Biden">Joe Biden</a>, who will interrupt Obama in the manner of a spoiled child.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Video_Vision">Video Vision</span></h3>
<p>While cleaning his office, Jimmy claims to have found some <a href="" title="VHS">VHS</a> cassettes from a 1980s production company named Video Vision.  The videos are usually short instructional pieces (such as &#34;Dealing with Sexual Harassment in the Workplace&#34;) hosted by Jimmy with a spiked haircut, thick glasses, cheesy sweater and faded jeans, and have many of the hallmarks of video production of the mid-80s, including low video quality, awkward scene transitions, choppy edits, low-quality special effects, and cheesy graphics which include typos and spelling errors.  Portions of the video tape may have been &#34;accidentally&#34; taped over with 1980&#39;s sitcoms.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Cupid.27s_Arrow">Cupid&#39;s Arrow</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy finds some old tapes of men from a 1980s video dating service that used to tape in Studio 6-B called &#34;Cupid&#39;s Arrow&#34;. The videos are low quality (possibly because they were produced by Video Vision). The men featured are unattractive losers, and Jimmy stated that most of them were probably still available. </p>
<p>The skit was later made into a <i><a href="" title="The Dating Game">Dating Game</a></i>-style TV show hosted by Tony Sanders (played by Higgins) with three of the men: Chester Mann (played by Salhudtin), a perverted part-time shoe salesman and freeloader; James Spadge (played by Miles), a nerdy virgin who lives with his mother; and Jose (played by Jimmy), a flamboyant musician; and a female audience member as the contestant, with the video quality downgraded to look like it was from the 1980s. Jose is always the winner.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Product_Placement_Preacher">Product Placement Preacher</span></h3>
<p>To get the audience excited about the show&#39;s sponsors, a fake gospel preacher named Rev. Daryl Bivens (played by Bashir Salahuddin) preaches about the products. Products have included the Big Philly Cheesesteak from <a href="" title="Subway (restaurant)">Subway</a>, Previlosec heartburn medication, and <a class="externallink" href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/107480/late-night-with-jimmy-fallon-product-placement-preacher" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.hulu.com/watch/107480/late-night-with-jimmy-fallon-product-placement-preacher">Toby&#39;s Rock Salt</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shout-Outs">Shout-Outs</span></h3>
<p>After Jimmy gives a <a href="" title="shout-out">shout-out</a> to someone, <a href="" title="Questlove">Questlove</a> asks Jimmy if he can give a shout-out to someone as well.  After doing so, other members of the cast and crew (usually including <a href="" title="Kamal Gray">Kamal Gray</a>, writer <a href="" title="Morgan Murphy (comedian)">Morgan Murphy</a>, director Dave Diomedi (always to his wife and about their sex life), <a href="" title="Tariq Trotter">Tariq Trotter</a> (usually about some sort of craft or cooking project; Trotter wears a blondish-red wig while demonstrating it), or a character played by Bashir Salahuddin) interrupt and ask for shout-outs to people or things of their own.  At the end, Jimmy quickly recaps each of the shout-outs.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="New_Velvet_Elvises">New Velvet Elvises</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy shows a series of <a href="" title="velvet Elvis">velvet Elvises</a> (or &#34;velvet Elvii&#34; as Jimmy claims they are also called) showing Presley in contemporary situations, such as listening to an <a href="" title="iPod">iPod</a>, skydiving, or appearing alongside people like Neytiri from the movie <i><a href="" title="Avatar (2009 film)">Avatar</a></i>, <a href="" title="Fox News">Fox News</a> commentator <a href="" title="Glenn Beck">Glenn Beck</a>, or the cast of <i><a href="" title="The Big Bang Theory">The Big Bang Theory</a></i>.  One of the velvet Elvises will usually include a <a href="" title="Chatty Cathy">pull-string activated &#34;voice box&#34;</a> (Jimmy pulls the string and holds the painting in front of his mouth so the audience cannot see him providing the voice).</p>
<p>The last painting is often of Elvis in a beige jumpsuit performing a particularly boring activity (e.g. taking a nap after doing a crossword puzzle, sitting on a park bench feeding birds).  After Jimmy comments on just how boring the activity is, a Boring Elvis impersonator comes out and sings a song about the activity.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Rejected_Catchphrases">Rejected Catchphrases</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy claims to have had a character left out of various movies and video games, such as <i><a href="" title="Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen">Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</a></i> or <i><a href="" title="Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</a></i>.  He shows us a series of outtakes of him spouting bad attempts at catchphrases.  Jimmy will also sometimes enlist actors promoting new movies to be in outtakes from those movies with him (including <a href="" title="Jude Law">Jude Law</a> for <i><a href="" title="Sherlock Holmes (2009 film)">Sherlock Holmes</a></i> and <a href="" title="Kim Cattrall">Kim Cattrall</a> for <i><a href="" title="Sex and the City 2">Sex and the City 2</a></i>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Audience_Suggestion_Box">Audience Suggestion Box</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy opens this sketch by saying, &#34;We&#39;re always striving to get better here at <i>Late Night.</i>&#34; This is followed by him and The Roots imitating a bar from <a href="" title="Daft Punk">Daft Punk</a>&#39;s <i><a href="" title="Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger">Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger</a></i>, which punctuates the camera zooming in on Jimmy four times. Suggestions ranging from the mundane (&#34;book <a href="" title="Sandra Bullock">Sandra Bullock</a> soon&#34; or &#34;more audience member close-ups&#34;) to the silly (such as &#34;have a stuntman dressed as <a href="" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> fall down the stairs&#34; or &#34;recreate the cover of <a href="" title="Nirvana (band)">Nirvana</a>&#39;s <i><a href="" title="Nevermind">Nevermind</a></i> with a grown man instead of a baby&#34;) are supposedly contributed by audience members. A frequent &#34;suggestion&#34; is to have Black Simon &#38; Garfunkel (actually The Roots&#39; Tariq Trotter and Questlove) perform a pop song to the tune of a Simon &#38; Garfunkel song. Some suggestions are for things Jimmy should do for fun in his free time, like &#34;Go see the new Transformers movie, it&#39;s pretty good.&#34;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Milky_J">Milky J</span></h3>
<p>After Jimmy passingly mentions the <a href="" title="Hubble Space Telescope">Hubble Space Telescope</a>, a man in the audience dressed head to toe in <a href="" title="New York Yankees">New York Yankees</a> apparel named Milky J (Bashir Salahuddin) enthusiastically begins listing and showing photos of astronomical features photographed by the telescope, each one punctuated by him yelling &#34;Hubble gotchu!&#34; He also sang a song about it, and later showed a rap video he made.  This sketch&#39;s timing may be based on the song &#34;Rock You&#34; by The Roots. </p>
<p>He appeared in a recent shout-outs skit, sending shout-outs to molecular models. Jimmy said he recognized him and Milky J explained that since Hubble is being phased out and replaced by the <a href="" title="James Webb Space Telescope">James Webb Space Telescope</a>, he&#39;d found a new interest. Jimmy then convinced him that Hubble is still something to get excited about, which made him go back into his old shtick.</p>
<p>Later, Jimmy mentioned a new planet, and Milky J showed up and went into his routine, but Jimmy once again mentioned how Hubble is being replaced by the James Webb telescope.  Milky J then did a rap video about his trip to <a href="" title="NASA">NASA</a>&#39;s <a href="" title="Goddard Space Flight Center">Goddard Space Flight Center</a> in <a href="" title="Greenbelt, Maryland">Greenbelt, Maryland</a> to try to convince them to stop the new telescope from being launched.</p>
<p>Milky J recently appeared in another shoutouts skit, this time giving a shoutout to gravity: breaking his unfaithful wife&#39;s valuables by dropping them and saying &#34;gravity got it&#34;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="How_You_Like_Me_Now.3F">How You Like Me Now?</span></h3>

After he does it twice, Jimmy does one as well, causing the man to declare Jimmy the superior player and leave the studio in shame, despite Jimmy&#39;s repeated attempts to make him stay.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="At_the_Bar_with_Roger_Federer">At the Bar with Roger Federer</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy shows a clip from a late-night <a href="" title="Tennis Channel">Tennis Channel</a> show starring <a href="" title="Roger Federer">Roger Federer</a> (played by Jimmy) called <i>At the Bar with Roger Federer</i>, where the tennis star hangs out in a bar and does strange things, including performing <a href="" title="yo-yo">yo-yo</a> tricks, identifying objects (incorrectly) by smell, and discussing his love/hate relationship with his good friend but fierce competitor <a href="" title="Rafael Nadal">Rafael Nadal</a>. The skit only airs during <a href="" title="Grand Slam (tennis)">Grand Slam Tennis Tournaments</a>, the current one of which Federer discusses during &#34;The Sports&#34; segment. The most recent edition of this skit involved Federer buying &#34;a round of drinks on the Federer,&#34; then serving a tennis ball between his legs so it causes <a href="" title="John McEnroe">John McEnroe</a>&#39;s drink to spill, which in turn provokes McEnroe to stand up angrily and yell, &#34;Come on, Roger! God! You cannot be serious!&#34; The camera then cuts back to Federer, who casually says &#34;That one&#39;s on me,&#34; as if nothing happened.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Flame_Eyes">Flame Eyes</span></h3>
<p>Less a full sketch and more a recurring bit, Jimmy will look directly into the camera and jets of fire of will emanate from his eyeballs.  Sometimes, he will instead shoot laser beams.  Less frequently, gobs of cooked <a href="" title="spaghetti">spaghetti</a> will come out.  Jimmy will also have <a href="" title="Steve Higgins">Steve Higgins</a>, <a href="" title="Questlove">Questlove</a>, and his celebrity guests play along with the gag as well.  Jimmy claims the ability to do these things is a side effect of his <a href="" title="LASIK">LASIK</a> surgery.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Wrestler_Entrances">Wrestler Entrances</span></h3>
<p>When Jimmy has a professional wrestler as a guest, they will usually enter the studio through a cloud of smoke via a trap door in one of the aisles of the audience area.</p>

<p>Once a month, Jimmy reviews several terrible (real) books (such as <i>How to Avoid Huge Ships: Second Edition</i>, <i>Castration: The Advantages and the Disadvantages</i>, <i>Cooking With [Winnie the] Pooh</i>, and <i>Knitting With Dog Hair</i>) and suggests people not read them.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Do_Not_Play_List">Do Not Play List</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy reviews several terrible (real) albums and songs (such as <a href="" title="Michael Henderson">Michael Henderson</a>&#39;s <i><a href="" title="Slingshot (album)">Slingshot</a></i>, <a href="" title="Hulk Hogan">Hulk Hogan</a>&#39;s <i><a href="" title="The Wrestling Boot Band">Hulk Rules</a></i>, two tracks off of <i>Music To Eat <a href="" title="Oscar Meyer">Oscar Meyer</a> Weiners By</i> (<a href="" title="Motown">Motown</a> style and <a href="" title="Bossa Nova">Bossa Nova</a> style), and <i>A Taste of Dick Black</i>).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Charlie_Sheen_commercials">Charlie Sheen commercials</span></h3>
<p>In the wake of <a href="" title="Charlie Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a>&#39;s post-rehab media blitz, Jimmy appeared as Sheen in two commercials: one selling his cologne &#34;Winning&#34;, and the other selling a <a href="" title="Time Life">Time Life</a> collection of CDs containing outrageous quotes by him.  Later, in response to the news that <a href="" title="Ashton Kutcher">Ashton Kutcher</a> would replace Sheen on <i><a href="" title="Two and a Half Men">Two and a Half Men</a></i>, Jimmy as Sheen made a new version of Kutcher&#39;s old show <i><a href="" title="Punk&#39;d">Punk&#39;d</a></i> called <i>Sheen&#39;d</i> in which he goes around acting obnoxious and bothering people at their jobs.  The real Sheen (who also promoted his new show <i><a href="" title="Anger Management (TV series)">Anger Management</a></i>) later appeared along side Jimmy-as-Sheen  in an ad for &#34;Clone&#34; cologne.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Celebrity_Whispers"><i>Celebrity Whispers</i></span></h3>
<p>Jimmy plays British TV show host Peggy Hess, who presents a series of clips of celebrities making small-talk at functions where they are not hooked up to microphones.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bargain_Bin">Bargain Bin</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy showcases some items that he has found on sale at various stores.  The price-reduction stickers have been strategically placed so that their names are more suggestive, turning a copy of <i><a href="" title="The Very Hungry Caterpillar">The Very Hungry Caterpillar</a></i> into <i>The Very Hung Caterpillar</i> or a DVD of the show <i><a href="" title="Picket Fences">Picket Fences</a></i> into <i>Picket Feces</i>.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Late_Night_E-Cards">Late Night E-Cards</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy showcases some interesting electronic greeting cards he&#39;s discovered, with the insides being insulting to the receiver.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Walter_Kump">Walter Kump</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy talks about going onto a website that does <a href="" title="Speech synthesis">computer text-to-speech conversions</a>, and then mentions that the computer voice is based on that of a nerdy man named Walter Kump (John Haskell).  He then brings out Kump for an interview, which shows off some of the comical mispronunciations, improper enunciation and misuse of punctuation (i.e. saying the word &#34;slash&#34; when a &#34;/&#34; appears in the script) that are prominent of computer-generated voices.</p>
<p>Kump later announced he has chosen a second career as a rapper and has recorded a music video, which Jimmy let him play on the show.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="On_the_Bright_Side">On the Bright Side</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy reads a somewhat depressing story from the news and then gives the silver lining.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Said_It_and_Re-Edit">Said It and Re-Edit</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy boils down a week&#39;s worth of a TV show to one sentence to allow his viewers to more quickly catch up on them.  The result is a humorous but still appropriate sentence, like <a href="" title="Rachel Maddow">Rachel Maddow</a> from <i><a href="" title="The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)">The Rachel Maddow Show</a></i> being edited to say &#34;<a href="" title="Newt Gingrich">Newt Gingrich</a> had an ultrasound, and it revealed a small horse inside his stomach.&#34;  The title of the sketch is a take-off of the <a href="" title="Ronco">Ronco</a> Showtime Rotisserie Grill&#39;s slogan &#34;set it and forget it&#34;.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Games">Games</span></h3>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Regular_Games">Regular Games</span></h4>

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Lick_it_For_Ten">Lick it For Ten</span></h5>
<p>A segment introduced on the show&#39;s first episode, in which Jimmy invites audience members to come on stage and lick objects, such as a lawn mower or a bowling ball, for ten dollars.  <a href="" title="Drew Barrymore">Drew Barrymore</a> and <a href="" title="Kelly Ripa">Kelly Ripa</a> have played the game as celebrities.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Wheel_of_Carpet_Samples">Wheel of Carpet Samples</span></h5>
<p>Introduced in the show&#39;s second week, this segment features a game with loosely-defined rules and bizarre scoring.  Three audience members are chosen to spin a wheel containing various carpet samples. The wheel includes a &#34;mystery sample&#34;, which is revealed by the announcer to both the audience and the contestants prior to game play.  Each contestant spins the wheel just once and is awarded a seemingly arbitrary point value (Jimmy tells the second contestant that the point value the first contestant scored is the maximum number of points a contestant can possibly get, and then asks if the second player thinks he or she can beat it). Each game contains the speed round with a &#34;carpet sample fun fact&#34;: a piece of trivia, and the &#34;lightning round&#34; in which the contestant must &#34;name as many things as possible&#34; in three seconds (after which Jimmy names a thing that is none of the things the contestant mentioned), and a &#34;carpet sample cartoon break&#34;. If a contestant lands on a piece that has already been won, Jimmy turns the wheel back five spaces. A seemingly arbitrary winner, chosen by Higgins (who wasn&#39;t paying attention because he was arguing his wife on the phone), wins the sample of carpet on which the wheel stopped during their spin. The other two contestants each receive a consolation prize that turns out to be much more valuable than the winning contestant&#39;s prize, usually a $300 gift card to the Apple Store (the winning contestant is ultimately awarded the consolation prize as well).</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Cell_Phone_Shootout">Cell Phone Shootout</span></h5>
<p>Jimmy picks 3 random audience members to come down. They are shown a table covered in various &#34;prizes&#34;, including a large-screen plasma TV (or a MacBook, or other similarly desirable popular item), tickets to a cleaning products convention, a used trumpet, lingerie, recorded VHS tapes, donuts for the entire audience, a box of rocks, a coffee mug, a year&#39;s worth of back issues of <i>Orthopedics</i> magazine, a pipe carved into Jimmy&#39;s likeness, a 15-second rave, and other similar kitschy items.  A <a href="" title="Sharp Aquos">Sharp 108</a> shows a rapid-fire series of images of the objects available to be won, with each image only visible for 1/6 of a second.  When Jimmy gives the cue, the contestants must snap a picture with their cellphone of whatever item is on the screen.  The contestant wins whatever item of which they have taken a picture.  One unlucky female contestant&#39;s phone was so slow to take a picture that all she photographed was the game&#39;s logo after the prizes had stopped flashing.  As a consolation prize, she was awarded &#34;donuts for the entire audience&#34;.  A frequent prize is &#34;The Call of the Wolf Waker&#34;: a man (Mike Dicenzo) covered head to toe in furs performs a wolf <a href="" title="game call">call</a> using his cupped hands; while he is performing the call, footage of sleeping wolves waking up is shown. Another grand prize was 15 seconds in the VIP room with two Victoria&#39;s Secret models.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Dance_Your_Hat_and_Gloves_Off">Dance Your Hat and Gloves Off</span></h5>
<p>In a parody of <i><a href="" title="Dance Your Ass Off">Dance Your Ass Off</a></i>, Jimmy invites 3 audience members on stage and challenges them to put on a yellow wool knit cap and yellow rubber gloves and try to get them off only by whipping their body parts around.  Jimmy warns that &#34;smurfing&#34; (wearing one&#39;s cap loosely and high on the head in the manner of a <a href="" title="The Smurfs">Smurf</a>) is not allowed.  Two points are awarded for removing a hat, with one point each for the gloves; ties are broken based on audience applause.  The winner receives $300 in one dollar bills, although the bills are presented in strange ways, such as wadded up and stuffed in a plastic bag, stuffed into the hollow handle of a snow shovel, or taped end-to-end in a long chain.  Losers receive a t-shirt.  Jimmy closes the segment by reciting a rhyming verse, which in some instances of the sketch becomes absurdly long and about an embarrassing health problem Jimmy has such as genital warts.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Karaoke_Contest">Karaoke Contest</span></h5>
<p>Jimmy challenges 3 audience members to a <a href="" title="karaoke">karaoke</a> contest where they sing quotes from a celebrity, including <a href="" title="Nicole Polizzi">Nicole Polizzi</a>, <a href="" title="John Madden (American football)">John Madden</a> and <a href="#Allegations_of_sexism_and_domestic_violence" title="Mel Gibson">Mel Gibson</a>; most installments use quotes from <a href="" title="Conservatism in the United States">American conservative</a> politicians and commentators, including <a href="" title="South Carolina">South Carolina</a> governor <a href="" title="Mark Sanford">Mark Sanford</a>; <a href="" title="Tea Party movement">Tea Party</a> convention speakers <a href="" title="Tom Tancredo">Tom Tancredo</a>, <a href="" title="Joseph Farah">Joseph Farah</a>, and <a href="" title="Sarah Palin">Sarah Palin</a>; Fox News hosts <a href="" title="Glenn Beck">Glenn Beck</a> and <a href="" title="Sean Hannity">Sean Hannity</a>; and, most frequently, <a href="" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>. The most recent version featured quotes from the erotic novel <i><a href="" title="Fifty Shades of Grey">Fifty Shades of Grey</a></i>.  The winner, determined by audience applause, receives a karaoke machine, and losers receive t-shirts.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Hot_Dog_in_a_Hole">Hot Dog in a Hole</span></h5>
<p>Jimmy invites three guests on stage, and they must attempt to throw the most <a href="" title="hot dog">hot dogs</a> through holes carved in the mouths of large (about 6 feet tall) celebrity faces.  The celebrities are usually related somehow, such as the cast of <i><a href="" title="New Moon (2009 film)">New Moon</a></i>, the three men from the TV show <i><a href="" title="Full House">Full House</a></i>, hosts on <a href="" title="Fox News Channel">Fox News Channel</a>, or politicians. (An installment of the game after the <a href="" title="United States House of Representatives">House</a> vote on the 2010 <a href="" title="Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act">health care legislation</a> featured Rep. <a href="" title="Henry Waxman">Henry Waxman</a> (D-CA); the Congressman&#39;s face had a smaller-than-usual mouth hole but added cutouts for his nostrils.)  In the case of a tie, contestants participate in a sudden-death toss-off.  The winner receives a <a href="" title="hot dog toaster">hot dog toaster</a>, and the losers receive a package of hot dogs.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Late_Night_Air_Drum_Challenge"><i>Late Night</i> Air Drum Challenge</span></h5>
<p>Three audience members play air drums (similar to <a href="" title="air guitar">air guitar</a>) along to a short drum-heavy instrumental track played by <a href="" title="The Roots">The Roots</a>.  The winner is selected by audience applause, who receives a drum kit donated by <a href="" title="Yamaha Corporation">Yamaha</a> and <a href="" title="Avedis Zildjian Company">Zildjian</a>.  The two losers receive <a href="" title="drumhead">drumheads</a> autographed by The Roots.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Celebrity_Man_Boobs">Celebrity Man Boobs</span></h5>
<p>Three audience members are each shown three close-up photos of different <a href="" title="gynecomastia">man boobs</a>, and are asked to pick which one belongs to a particular celebrity.  The three photos are given punny names such as &#34;<a href="" title="Area 51">Areola 51</a>&#34; or &#34;<a href="" title="Yo Gabba Gabba!">Yo Flabba-Flabba</a>&#34;.  Winners receive a man boobs-themed wall calendar, and losers receive a &#34;Man Boobs&#34; t-shirt.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Competitive_Spit-Takes">Competitive Spit-Takes</span></h5>
<p>Two pairs of audience members compete.  One member of each pair rolls a specially marked die to determine whether they will be spitting or receiving.  The spitter takes a sip of water, and then the receiver recites the punch line to a provided joke (usually in the form of &#34;[Normal phrase]?  I thought you said [similar-sounding sexual phrase]!&#34;), at which the spitter performs their best <a href="" title="spit-take">spit-take</a>.  Audience applause determines the winning team.  Sometimes, Jimmy will have the spitter and receiver switch positions if their first spit-take is particularly good or they have extra time.  The winning team receives a pair of hand towels embroidered with the &#34;Competitive Spit-Takes&#34; logo, while the losing team receives a pair of <a href="" title="wet wipe">moist towelettes</a>.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Dancing_on_Air">Dancing on Air</span></h5>
<p>Three audience members select styles of dance (e.g. <a href="" title="Irish stepdance">Irish stepdance</a>, <a href="" title="ballet">ballet</a>, or <a href="" title="disco">disco</a>) out of Jimmy&#39;s &#34;Velvety Dance Bag&#34;, and then attempt to perform that dance style after being hung by a harness ten feet in the air.  The winner is selected by audience applause.  The winner receives a dancing-themed prize, such as <a href="" title="Nintendo">Nintendo</a> <a href="" title="Wii">Wii</a> and a dancing game or <a href="" title="Arthur Murray">Arthur Murray</a> dancing lessons, while the losers receive t-shirts.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Battle_of_the_Instant_Bands">Battle of the Instant Bands</span></h5>
<p>Before the show, Jimmy selects members of the audience who are musicians but do not otherwise know each other.  They are split into two &#34;instant bands&#34; and are given about half an hour to come up with a band name, design an album cover, and write a song to perform.  Winners are determined by audience applause.  Winners receive the instruments they played and a $300 gift certificate to <a href="" title="Guitar Center">Guitar Center</a>, while the losers receive t-shirts.</p>
<p>On the June 15, 2011 show, Jimmy hosted the finalists in <i><a href="" title="Rolling Stone">Rolling Stone</a></i> and <a href="" title="Garnier">Garnier Fructis</a>&#39; &#34;Choose the Cover&#34; contest (Lelia Broussard from Los Angeles, CA and The Sheepdogs from <a href="" title="Saskatoon">Saskatoon</a>, <a href="" title="Saskatchewan">SK</a>).  Prior to the show, a member of the audience (Terry Patterson from the San Francisco area) was selected and both bands had to write a song about her.  Each member of both bands received a <i>Late Night</i> t-shirt, and the winning band (The Sheepdogs) received 20 pints of Jimmy&#39;s <a href="" title="Ben &amp;amp; Jerry&#39;s">Ben &#38; Jerry&#39;s</a> flavor, &#34;Late Night Snack&#34;.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Battle_of_the_Instant_Dance_Crews">Battle of the Instant Dance Crews</span></h5>
<p>Similar to Battle of the Instant Bands, Jimmy assembles two dance crews from the audience and has them each choreograph a dance routine in under an hour.  The winners each receive $300 gift cards from <a href="" title="J.Crew">J.Crew</a>, while the losers win $100 gift cards.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Put_It_In_Reverse">Put It In Reverse</span></h5>
<p>Two audience members are given a scene to perform with Jimmy in reverse (walking backward, etc.).  After they complete the scene, the footage is then shown reversed so that it looks normal.  The winner is determined by audience applause, who receives a piece of reversible clothing (such as a jacket or a jersey), while the loser receives a t-shirt with a reversed <i>Late Night</i> logo.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Spanx_But_No_Spanx">Spanx But No Spanx</span></h5>
<p>Two teams of three male audience members race in a relay to pass a <a href="" title="Spanx">Spanx</a> body-shaping undergarment over their bodies as fast as possible.  After taking the garment off of a mannequin, the first person steps into it and then pulls the garment over his head.  The next team member then pulls the garment over his head and off over his feet.  The third team member reverses direction once again and pulls the garment on feet-first.  After pulling the garment over his head, the third team member then races to deposit the garment in a basket (the &#34;Spanx Bank&#34;).  The other team members may assist in the passing of the garment, but cannot bunch it up or fold it onto itself.  The winning team wins <i>Late Night</i> compression t-shirts and a pair of Spanx, and the losers receive regular <i>Late Night</i> t-shirts.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Say_What.21.3F">Say What!?</span></h5>
<p>Three audience members &#34;try to decipher the garbled-mouth ramblings of Rickie Johnston, a pig farmer with a real anger-management problem,&#34; according to Jimmy.  Johnston (played by Bobby Tisdale) is a stereotypical <a href="" title="redneck">redneck</a>, dressed in a pair of overalls, a trucker&#39;s hat, and no shirt, in addition to a huge mouthful of <a href="" title="chewing tobacco">chewing tobacco</a> and an exaggerated <a href="" title="Southern American English">Southern accent</a>.  The game has three rounds, worth 10, 100, and 1000 points.  The first two rounds vary, but the third round is always &#34;What&#39;s On Rickie&#39;s Mini-Dish Tonight?&#34;, which involves Johnston acting out a scene from a movie and the contestants must guess its title.  The winner of the first installment of the game had the choice between a chocolate-covered horseshoe and a &#34;beer-amid&#34; (a pyramid made from cement-filled beer cans) as a prize and chose the beer-amid.  The second installment of the game had as its prize a package of paper plates.  The third installment awarded a watch made from a can of chewing tobacco.  The losers receive a bag of frozen <a href="" title="tater tots">tater tots</a>, with Jimmy giving Rickie a bag as well (they&#39;re his favorite).</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Name_That_Guy">Name That Guy</span></h5>
<p>Three audience members are shown pictures of non-celebrities and each must guess the first and last name of the person shown. The images of non-famous men flashes quickly with one of a famous man second to last (usually 1990s sitcom stars).  They show&#39;s grand prize, $15,000 has never been won, but the losers (all contestants are invariably losers) receive a T-shirt with their person&#39;s name on it (Higgins encourages all contestants to &#34;wear your shame in style&#34;).  The spirit of the game is similar to &#34;<a href="#Wheel_of_Carpet_Samples" title="">Wheel of Carpet Samples</a>&#34;. Due to &#34;lack of budget&#34;, the segment uses scene transition graphics from <i><a href="" title="Home Improvement (TV series)">Home Improvement</a></i> between contestants. It also features &#34;Name That Guy Fun Facts&#34; like &#34;[non-famous man]&#34; was born in was born in <a href="" title="Cincinnati">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>&#34;.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Models_and_Buckets">Models and Buckets</span></h5>
<p>Jimmy claims this is &#34;the game that everyone is talking about.&#34; This is followed by five brief video clips of five different people strung together so it sounds like they are saying the sentence, &#34;I love Models and Buckets.&#34; The models are brought out and Jimmy will ask them an open ended question like &#34;How was your weekend?&#34;, with them all giving a different answer at the same time. Jimmy then  brings in two male members of the audience who, one at a time, choose from 12 buckets, each held by a model (similar to <i><a href="" title="Deal or No Deal">Deal or No Deal</a></i>) and filled with various items such as food (e.g. orange soda, baked beans, or chocolate syrup), confetti, or packing peanuts to be poured on their head by the models.  One of the buckets contains fake $1 bills instead; the contestant picking that bucket wins a giant check for $100. The loser receives a <i>Late Night</i> <a href="" title="bucket hat">bucket hat</a> (Jimmy and The Roots then begin a rap interlude about the bucket hat).  The initial installment of the game used 16 buckets instead of 12.  When only six buckets remain, the game enters the &#34;double trouble&#34; phase, where both contestants select buckets each time around and the models pour the contents simultaneously.  If a contestant wins early in the game, Jimmy will have the models reset with new buckets and the contestants play a second game for another $100. In one installment, both contestants won $100, and the bucket hat was not awarded.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Buzzwords">Buzzwords</span></h5>
<p>Jimmy had audience members roll a <a href="#Standard_variations" title="dice">twenty-sided die</a> with a letter on each face (likely taken from the game <a href="" title="Scattergories">Scattergories</a>) and say as many words that start with that letter, with rules such as no proper nouns, no long pauses between words, etc.  Contestants win $10 cash for each correct word.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Copy_Machine_Match_Game">Copy Machine Match Game</span></h5>
<p>While two audience members are blindfolded and wear noise-canceling headphones on stage, Jimmy selects another audience member to come down and photocopy their face; after doing so, that person returns to their seat.  One at a time, the two contestants are given the photocopy and must run into the audience to find the photocopied person.  While they are searching, the Roots play music whose tempo slows or fastens depending on how &#34;hot&#34; or &#34;cold&#34; the contestant is in their search.  The contestant that finds the photocopied person fastest is declared the winner and receives a desktop <a href="" title="multifunction printer">printer/fax/scanner/copier</a>, while both the loser and the photocopied person receive a ream of copy paper.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Karate_Pi.C3.B1ata">Karate Piñata</span></h5>
<p>Three blindfolded audience members attempt to break ball-shaped <a href="" title="piñata">piñatas</a> with smiley faces on them (which &#34;bear a striking resemblance to celebrities in the news&#34;) rotating around them using only <a href="" title="karate">karate</a> kicks.  Ties are broken by &#34;kicking awesomeness&#34; (as voted on by the audience).  The winner receives $300 worth of boxed taco kits, while the losers receive <i>Late Night</i> <a href="" title="black belt (martial arts)">black belts</a>.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="What.27s_Mine_Is_Yours">What&#39;s Mine Is Yours</span></h5>
<p>Five audience members each donate one of their possessions to a communal &#34;jackpot&#34;.  Jimmy spices it up by adding the contents of a wallet in his pocket, including $500 (sometimes in cash, sometimes as a gift card to the <a href="" title="Apple Store">Apple Store</a>).</p>
<p>Each of the five audience members has their name on a tile in a bucket.  One at a time, Jimmy pulls a tile from the bucket to eliminate contestants until only one contestant is left, who wins everything in the jackpot.  The other four contestants receive <i>Late Night</i> t-shirts or sweatshirts.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Doll_Posin.27">Doll Posin&#39;</span></h5>
<p>Three audience members are, one at a time, shown a collectible doll for five seconds, and then have thirty seconds to assume the pose of the doll as closely as possible using a box of props and costumes.  Contestants that have yet to play are placed beneath large blue sensory-deprivation &#34;domes of silence&#34;.  The winner is chosen by audience applause; in the first installment, the winner received a three-foot-tall <a href="" title="Barbie">Barbie</a> doll, but in later installments the prize was $100 and the doll the contestants were imitating.  Losers receive doll-sized <i>Late Night</i> t-shirts.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Darts_of_Insanity">Darts of Insanity</span></h5>
<p>A series of stunts, each with an associated point value, cycles rapid-fire on the &#34;Dartboard of Insanity&#34; (the Sharp 108).  Three audience members, one at a time, shoot a <a href="" title="Nerf">Nerf</a> dart gun at the Dartboard, stopping the cycle on a particular stunt.  Whichever contestant completes the stunt with the highest point value is declared the winner.  All three contestants receive $100 and either a t-shirt or a &#34;<a href="" title="beer koozie">beer koozie</a> sweatshirt&#34; (a sweatshirt with a pocket for a beer bottle on the front), although only the winner receives his $100 in the form of a giant check.</p>
<p>Only a few of the &#34;available&#34; games are ever played.  Some of the games are highlighted by Jimmy before the game; some are named and also described - these are usually over the top.  Still others only ever appear in the rotation.  The last game to be played is always &#34;Dude Spoon&#34;.  (Some contestants land on &#34;Dude Spoon,&#34; but are given the option to spin again; they then land on &#34;Double Dude Spoon&#34;, where they have to spoon with two dudes instead of just one.)  The point value of games can vary from episode to episode.</p>

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Wax_On.2C_Wax_Off">Wax On, Wax Off</span></h5>
<p>Two audience members compete, at least one male.  One of the contestants tries to answer trivia questions; each correct answer earns the team $100, but for each incorrect answer, the non-answerer has a portion of his chest hair removed with <a href="" title="waxing">hot wax</a>.  Unfortunately, all of the questions are in obscure <i><a href="" title="Jeopardy!">Jeopardy!</a></i>-like categories such as &#34;<a href="" title="Latvia">Latvian</a> <a href="" title="Prime Minister">Prime Ministers</a>&#34;, &#34;13th-Century <a href="" title="South America">South American</a> Architecture&#34;, and &#34;Much Ado About &#39;<a href="" title="Quantum Mechanics">Quantum Mechanics</a>&#39;&#34; (&#34;you&#39;ll notice &#39;quantum mechanics&#39; is in quotes&#34;, says Jimmy).  The last regular question is played in the &#34;double trouble&#34; format, where two portions of hair are at stake.  The question is usually in the category &#34;Numbers&#34;, and the question is usually &#34;I&#39;m thinking of a number between 1 and 1000 - what is it?&#34;  (After the contestant gives his guess, Jimmy offers him the chance to change his guess.  After doing so, Jimmy reveals the correct number was actually their first guess.)  The &#34;lightning round&#34; features categories flashing by quickly, with easy categories like music, TV, and movies being skipped over for another difficult category at the end.  As a consolation prize, the contestants are given &#34;Ed Zeppelin&#34; t-shirts (also a prize in the &#34;Wheel of Game Shows&#34; game) and a 24-pack of Nad&#39;s body hair removal strips.</p>
<p>The person being waxed in the installment that aired May 15, 2011, was <a href="" title="New York Jets">New York Jets</a> <a href="" title="center (American football)">center</a> <a href="" title="Nick Mangold">Nick Mangold</a>.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Wheel_of_Game_Shows">Wheel of Game Shows</span></h5>
<p>Another surreal game in the spirit of &#34;Wheel of Carpet Samples&#34;.  Three audience members play mini-games selected by pressing the &#34;game pud&#34; (a buzzer) as the options rotate on the Sharp 108 (similar to the game show <i><a href="" title="Press Your Luck">Press Your Luck</a></i>).  If a player lands on a picture of actor <a href="" title="Steve Guttenberg">Steve Guttenberg</a>, however, they lose their turn and owe the show $75 (similar to <i>Press Your Luck</i>  &#34;Whammy&#34;).  To this end, Jimmy urges the contestants to shout &#34;No Guttenbergs!&#34; as the monitor rotates.</p>
<p>Games available include: &#34;Heads or Tails?&#34;, &#34;Word of the Day&#34;, &#34;Wet Nap Face Slap&#34;, &#34;<i><a href="" title="iCarly">iCarly</a></i> Trivia vs. the Roots&#34;, &#34;Number Scramble&#34;, &#34;Hands in Your Pants&#34;, &#34;Hide the Shoe&#34;, &#34;Animal Farm&#34;, &#34;Dance Dance Dance&#34;, &#34;Where Did You Get That Shirt?&#34;, &#34;True or False&#34;, &#34;Yes or No&#34;, &#34;Grab the Cupcake&#34;, &#34;Remember That Episode of <i><a href="" title="Full House (TV series)">Full House</a></i>&#34;, &#34;Jellybean Jar&#34;, &#34;Grocery List&#34;, &#34;You Can&#39;t Possibly Win!&#34;, &#34;Brownie Points&#34;, &#34;Magnet Scramble&#34;, &#34;Rock, Paper, Scissors, Nuclear Warhead&#34;, &#34;Tarantula Bonanza&#34;, &#34;What&#39;s In The Box?&#34;, &#34;Guess the Card&#34;, and &#34;Drawing Board&#34;.</p>
<p>After all contestants inevitably tie at zero points since Jimmy doesn&#39;t tell them how to play the games, even after a &#34;tiebreaker&#34; (such as &#34;Brownie Points&#34;, &#34;Shut Your Pie Hole&#34;, or &#34;Egg On Your Face&#34;), they all receive copies of the <i><a href="" title="Saturday Night Live">Saturday Night Live</a></i> board game (with three pieces missing) and <a href="" title="Led Zeppelin">Led Zeppelin</a> t-shirts where the first &#34;L&#34; has fallen off so that they read &#34;Ed Zeppelin&#34;.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Put_It_On_a_Cracker">Put It On a Cracker</span></h5>
<p>Two audience members compete.  Each is blindfolded and fed a cracker with three different foods on top (such as pepperoni, peanut butter, and <a href="" title="Swedish fish">Swedish fish</a>).  They must try to name as many of the ingredients as they can.  The winner receives a $300 gift certificate to <a href="" title="Whole Foods Market">Whole Foods</a>, while the loser gets to interact with a celebrity impersonator (such as <a href="" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a> or young <a href="" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a>) (and is also given a $150 gift certificate to Whole Foods).</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Ready_Set_Flow">Ready Set Flow</span></h5>
<p>Three audience members compete.  They are each given three nouns (an object, a place, and a name - e.g. <a href="" title="Barbie">Barbie Doll</a>, <a href="" title="France">France</a>, and <a href="" title="Charlie Sheen">Charlie Sheen</a>) they must work into a 30-second freestyle rap.  The nouns are generated by &#34;Rhyme Wave&#34;, a &#34;robot&#34; (played by Tariq Trotter) with a computerized voice that appears on the Sharp 108.  The winner is determined by audience applause.  The winner receives a <a href="" title="TASCAM">TASCAM</a> <a href="" title="portastudio">pocket studio digital recorder</a>, while the runners-up receive <i>Late Night</i> t-shirts, notepads, and pens to write down their own raps.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Sing_It_Like_You_Mean_It">Sing It Like You Mean It</span></h5>
<p>Two audience members compete.  Each is played a new song by the Roots that they must memorize and then immediately perform.  The contestant that has yet to play is placed beneath a large blue sensory-deprivation &#34;dome of silence&#34;.  The winner is determined by audience applause, who is given a $100 bill and a burned CD with their song rendition on it, while the loser receives a <i>Late Night</i> t-shirt.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Tell_Us_What_You_Know">Tell Us What You Know</span></h5>
<p>Three audience members compete.  Each is given a topic by Jimmy and is given 10 seconds to give as many words as possible relating to that topic.  After time is up, they are given a score by the &#34;Brainmaster&#34; (Mike Dicenzo, wearing a brown robe, turban, and a large, light-up brain).  The winner is given a special prize in an ornate wooden chest (selected by the Brainmaster).  The two losers receive cans of <a href="" title="Turtle Wax">Turtle Wax</a>.  (The winner&#39;s prize, coincidentally, is also Turtle Wax.)  (In one playing, the contestants received giftcards to <a href="" title="Subway (restaurant)">Subway</a>, and the winner also received a bag of potato chips autographed by <a href="" title="Tony Danza">Tony Danza</a>.)</p>

<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Smooth_Operator">Smooth Operator</span></h5>
<p>This game is similar to <i><a href="" title="The Dating Game">The Dating Game</a></i>. A woman is blindfolded and three male suitors try to impress her by reading a random pick-up line selected by spinning a wheel.  The woman then selects the suitor who she was most impressed by.  The winner gets to spend the show at a dinner table with the woman for the rest of the show, and they are served glasses of wine by announcer <a href="" title="Steve Higgins">Steve Higgins</a>.  This game has only been played once thus far, during 2009 <a href="#New_York_City" title="Fleet Week">Fleet Week in New York City</a>.  A <a href="" title="United States Marine Corps">US Marine</a> was picked as the winner of the contest, mainly because the other Marines in the audience gave him extra cheer support.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Late_Night_Recognizes_the_Olympics"><i>Late Night</i> Recognizes the Olympics</span></h5>

The first was &#34;Bobbing for Gold&#34;, where three audience members <a href="" title="apple bobbing">bobbed</a> for plastic medals of several colors in an attempt to find a gold one.  The second was &#34;Ski Boot Dash&#34;, where three audience members wearing ski boots competed in a <a href="" title="racewalking">speed-walking</a> race around the studio.  Third was &#34;Finger Skating&#34;, where three contestants put tiny ice skates on two of their fingers and performed skating routines on a miniature rink.
Gold, silver, and bronze medals were awarded for each event, and the Roots played five seconds of &#34;<a href="" title="The Star-Spangled Banner">The Star-Spangled Banner</a>&#34; for the winner as the contestants stood on a podium.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Winds_of_War">Winds of War</span></h5>
<p>Jimmy pronounces the name of the game with vocalized &#39;h&#39;s before &#34;winds&#34; and &#34;war&#34;, as if it were &#34;Hwinds of Hwar&#34;.  Two audience members blow into a transparent tube to try to push a ball to their opponent&#39;s end of the tube using only their breath.  The winner is given a military-style medal, while the loser receives a t-shirt.  To date, this game has only been played once, possibly due to some technical difficulties with the game equipment during the first playing.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Dancing_with_the_Cardboard_Cutouts_of_the_Stars">Dancing with the Cardboard Cutouts of the Stars</span></h5>
<p>In a parody of <i><a href="" title="Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)">Dancing with the Stars</a></i>, three audience members are each given a sequined vest and a life-sized cutout of a celebrity (wearing a sequined bow tie matching the audience member&#39;s vest).  They perform a short dance with their cardboard partner and then give a short &#34;backstage&#34; interview with <a href="" title="Morgan Murphy (comedian)">Morgan Murphy</a>.  The winner is determined by audience applause, who wins a 2-D trophy and gets to keep their cardboard cutout.  The losers receive t-shirts.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="And_The_Winner_Is.E2.80.A6">And The Winner Is…</span></h5>
<p>Jimmy and Higgins are presenters at an awards show for the category of &#34;Winner&#34;.  Three audience members are nominated, and whichever person&#39;s name is in the envelope comes to the stage and gives a five second acceptance speech before being played off by the Roots.  In the first installment, the winner also received a trip to <a href="" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rica</a>.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Teleprompter_Limbo">Teleprompter Limbo</span></h5>
<p>Three audience members come to the stage, are made up to look like <i><a href="" title="Jersey Shore (TV series)">Jersey Shore</a></i> cast members and have to read quotes from that show from a <a href="" title="teleprompter">teleprompter</a> which runs increasingly faster.  The contestant who is able to read the longest without making a mistake is declared the winner and receives a t-shirt that says &#34;I READ WELL&#34;, while the losers get shirts that say &#34;I DON&#39;T READ WELL&#34;.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Baby_Bird">Baby Bird</span></h5>
<p>Two teams of two audience members each dress as a mother bird and baby bird.  The &#34;mama bird&#34; grabs (<a href="" title="gummi worms">gummi</a>) worms from a pile of &#34;dirt&#34; using their mouth and then spits them into the mouth of the &#34;baby bird&#34;, who then spits them into a nearby eggshell.  The team with the most worms in their egg shell at the end of 20 seconds wins.  Ties are broken via bird-calling contest.  The winners receive a bird feeder, while losers receive bags of bird seed.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Cone_Collar_Derby">Cone Collar Derby</span></h5>
<p>Two audience members are fitted with large clear plastic conical collars (similar to the <a href="" title="Elizabethan collar">Elizabethan collars</a> used by veterinarians).  One at a time, they are given 30 seconds to make a lap of the audience.  Each of the other members of the audience is given two foam balls (one for each contestant), which they try to throw into the collars of the contestants as they pass by.  The contestant who collects the most foam balls is declared the winner, and gets to stand under the &#34;<i>Late Night</i> Cash Dump&#34; (a basket with a hatch in the bottom, filled with dollar bills, suspended from the ceiling) and try to collect as much cash as they can in their cone.  (During the initial playing of the game, the Cash Dump malfunctioned, dropping the cash before the winner could stand under it; Jimmy gave the winner all the dropped cash to make up for the mistake.)  The other contestant receives a &#34;<a href="" title="beer koozie">beer koozie</a> sweatshirt&#34; (a sweatshirt with a pocket for a beer bottle on the front).</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Silent_Library"><i>Silent Library</i></span></h5>
<p>To commemorate Jimmy and the Roots appearing on an episode of the <a href="" title="MTV">MTV</a> game show <i><a href="" title="Silent Library (MTV series)">Silent Library</a></i>, Jimmy invited six audience members to play a few rounds of the game.  For three rounds, one of the six contestants was chosen at random using a deck of special cards.  That person must complete a laugh-inducing stunt within a specified time frame, but all members of the team must stay quiet enough to avoid setting off a noise meter.  Each contestant earns $50 for a completed stunt, but loses that money if the noise meter goes off or they fail to complete the stunt.  The contestants played three stunts: &#34;Fish Music&#34;, where one person had to play a <a href="" title="harmonica">harmonica</a> wedged in the mouth of a fish; &#34;Eat Cake&#34;, where one person had three cupcakes snapped against his face using a slingshot attached to his head; and &#34;Balled Pedal&#34;, where one contestant had to pedal a <a href="" title="Rube Goldberg machine">Rube Goldbergish</a> device that shot tennis balls at his face.  Even though Jimmy judged that the group had made too much noise during the second stunt, he ended up giving each contestant the full $150.</p>
<h5><span class="mw-headline" id="Pretty_Boys">Pretty Boys</span></h5>
<p>Two teams of two male audience members play.  After <a href="" title="drawing straws">&#34;drawing brushes&#34;</a>, the &#34;short brush&#34; has his face made up (usually sloppily) by his teammate according to a theme, such as &#34;prom&#34;.  Audience applause determines the winning team.  The makeup &#34;victims&#34; each receive a $100 gift certificate to <a href="" title="Kiehl&#39;s">Kiehl&#39;s</a> and <i>Late Night</i> t-shirts.</p>

The old president was later &#34;impeached&#34; on April 17, 2009, and a new president was appointed.
On March 10, 2010, after Jimmy complained that neither of the previous presidents ever showed up to work, he &#34;elected&#34; a new president by picking one audience member at random.  Jimmy gave the new president a &#34;presidential starter kit&#34;, including a copy of the <i>Late Night</i> by-laws, a quill pen, a carton of cigarettes, a stapler, and a <a href="" title="first lady">first lady</a> with &#34;shapely arms&#34;.

<p>Jimmy asks audience members random questions.  House band <a href="" title="The Roots">The Roots</a> then makes up a song about them on the spot using that information in a music style of Jimmy&#39;s choosing (reggae, &#39;80s pop, doo-wop, etc.).

They are then asked to concentrate for 15 seconds on a particular subject provided by Jimmy.  Then, after pressing the button on the Think-O-Sync-ometer, Jimmy &#34;pokes&#34; each contestant&#39;s cerebral cortex nipple, allowing the Think-O-Sync-ometer to &#34;project&#34; the audience member&#39;s thoughts.</p>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Audience_Artwork">Audience Artwork</span></h4>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Beer_Shuffleboard">Beer Shuffleboard</span></h3>

The two later played another game after a dispute arose over an interpretation of the rules of the game.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Saved_by_the_Bell_.2F_California_Dreams_Reunion"><i>Saved by the Bell</i> / <i>California Dreams</i> Reunion</span></h3>
<p>On the March 27, 2009 episode, Fallon explained that he had watched an episode of <i><a href="" title="Saved by the Bell">Saved by the Bell</a></i> that morning. The episode he watched was <i>The Prom</i>, where Kelly opted to give the money she had saved to go to the prom with Zack to her father, who had just lost his job. Fallon commented on the absurdity of Kelly&#39;s father losing his job at a weapons plant because &#34;world peace had broken out&#34;, and also pointed out that the year 2009 is the twentieth anniversary of <i>Saved by the Bell</i>.  Fallon then decided to launch a campaign to persuade the original cast of <i>Saved by the Bell</i> to appear in a reunion special on his show. <a href="" title="Dennis Haskins">Dennis Haskins</a>, who portrayed <a href="" title="Mr. Belding">Mr. Belding</a>, was the first to agree to take part in the reunion, and appeared on the show the same night Fallon launched the campaign. On April 3, 2009, it was announced that <a href="" title="Lark Voorhees">Lark Voorhees</a>, who portrayed <a href="" title="Lisa Turtle">Lisa Turtle</a>, would also be joining the reunion, making her the second <i>Saved by the Bell</i> guest. On April 24, 2009, <a href="" title="Mario Lopez">Mario Lopez</a> appeared on the show. After helping Fallon re-enact almost verbatim the climactic scene of the episode <i>Save the Max</i> in which the <i>Saved by the Bell</i> gang put together a pledge-drive to save The Max (altered to <i>Late Night</i> putting on a pledge drive to reunite the <i>Saved by the Bell</i> cast), he agreed to appear on the reunion.</p>
<p>On June 8, 2009, <a href="" title="Mark Paul Gosselaar">Mark Paul Gosselaar</a> appeared on the show as a guest to promote his series <i><a href="" title="Raising the Bar (TV series)">Raising the Bar</a></i>. When he came out on stage, he was dressed as his <i>Saved by the Bell</i> character <a href="" title="Zack Morris">Zack Morris</a> and claimed that since graduating college, he had been living in <a href="" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, working as an actor named Mark Paul Gosselaar because &#34;there was already a Zack Morris in <a href="" title="Screen Actors Guild">SAG</a>&#34;. After agreeing to appear on the reunion, he received a phone call, on his signature oversized early-1990s–era cell phone, from <a href="" title="Jessie Spano">Jessie Spano</a>; Gosselaar then informed Fallon that <a href="" title="Elizabeth Berkley">Elizabeth Berkley</a> had also agreed to appear on the reunion. At the end of his appearance, Gosselaar sang <i>Friends Forever</i>, a song performed by the <i>Saved by the Bell</i> gang&#39;s band <i>Zack Attack</i>. Fallon and The Roots also performed with him.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Barking_Points"><i>Barking Points</i></span></h3>
<p><a href="" title="Michael Moore">Michael Moore</a> and golden retriever puppy Gary Frick (from the &#34;If Puppies Could Vote&#34; sketches) appeared on a Michigan public-access political call-in show hosted by Jimmy.  All of the calls were directed to Gary, and they were all &#34;Who&#39;s a good boy?  Who&#39;s a good boy?&#34;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Freestylin.27_with_Elvis_Costello">Freestylin&#39; with Elvis Costello</span></h3>
<p>Similar to Freestylin&#39; with The Roots, Jimmy asked an audience member several questions and guest <a href="" title="Elvis Costello">Elvis Costello</a> improvised a song using her answers.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Dexter_Morgan.27s_Christmas_carol">Dexter Morgan&#39;s Christmas carol</span></h3>
<p><a href="" title="Michael C. Hall">Michael C. Hall</a> performed &#34;<a href="" title="Santa Claus is Coming to Town">Santa Claus is Coming to Town</a>&#34; as <a href="" title="Dexter Morgan">Dexter Morgan</a>, replacing certain lines with violent lyrics.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Won.27t_You_Pop_My_Balloon.3F">Won&#39;t You Pop My Balloon?</span></h3>
<p>As Jimmy, wearing a red and white-pinstriped jacket, bow tie, and straw boater hat, sang a song called &#34;Won&#39;t You Pop My Balloon?&#34; while standing at a hot dog / balloon cart, <a href="" title="Tracy Morgan">Tracy Morgan</a> came out wearing a blonde wig and a white <a href="" title="unitard">unitard</a> with a helium-filled balloon attached at the navel.  After the two danced for a bit, Jimmy popped Tracy&#39;s balloon, which dismayed Tracy.  (&#34;Damn, Jim, that&#39;s all I had going for me.&#34;)  Jimmy then replaced the balloon and the pair continued dancing.</p>
<p>Jimmy and Tracy reprised the segment on the November 1, 2011 episode.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Slappington_Manor"><i>Slappington Manor</i></span></h3>
<p>Jimmy shows a scene from <i>Slappington Manor</i>, a show in which the band <a href="" title="Kings of Leon">Kings of Leon</a> runs a bed and breakfast he visits with constant slapping.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Tumbleweed_Canyon"><i>Tumbleweed Canyon</i></span></h3>
<p>Jimmy and <a href="" title="Dana Carvey">Dana Carvey</a> played cowboys on a Canadian mini-series called <i>Tumbleweed Canyon</i>.  They sat at the bar in a salloon drinking <a href="" title="sarsparilla">sarsparilla</a> and made fun of the people who come in (&#34;Well, well, well, looky what we&#39;ve got here!&#34;) - although their insults mainly consisted of listing each person&#39;s job functions in a mocking tone - driving each of them off.  After the bartender called them out on their behavior, they briefly psychoanalyzed each other (they are bullies because of severe self-hatred and unhappy childhoods) before rejecting their new attitude and went back to making fun of people.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hide_the_Pickle">Hide the Pickle</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy and <a href="" title="Kirsten Dunst">Kirsten Dunst</a> played the &#34;traditional&#34; German Christmas game of trying to find a pickle ornament (Hallmark&#39;s &#34;Hide-&#39;n&#39;-Seek Pickles&#34; Keepsake Ornament&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;) hidden on a Christmas tree.  The first to find it won a Christmas sweater.  Jimmy found the ornament, but elected to give Kirsten the sweater.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Relationship_with_Stephen_Colbert">Relationship with Stephen Colbert</span></h3>
<p>After <a href="" title="Stephen Colbert">Stephen Colbert</a> auctioned off a portrait of himself &#34;enhanced&#34; by artists <a href="" title="Shepard Fairey">Shepard Fairey</a> and <a href="" title="Andres Serrano">Andres Serrano</a> for the charity <a href="" title="DonorsChoose">DonorsChoose</a>, he declared on his show, <i><a href="" title="The Colbert Report">The Colbert Report</a></i>, that his &#34;BFF for six months,&#34; Jimmy Fallon, was going to match the auction price, $26,000.  On the next night&#39;s <i>Late Night</i>, Fallon demurred, saying, &#34;here&#39;s the thing: I never said that.&#34;  Hearing that, Colbert came out on the <i>Late Night</i> stage and chided him, saying, &#34;if you can&#39;t donate $26,000 of your best friend&#39;s money without asking him first, what&#39;s the point in being best friends?&#34;  In quasi-retaliation, Fallon announced that if his viewers would donate the $26,000 to DonorsChoose, Colbert would appear with the Roots to sing <a href="" title="Rebecca Black">Rebecca Black</a>&#39;s &#34;<a href="" title="Friday (Rebecca Black song)">Friday</a>&#34;.  (Fallon claimed he couldn&#39;t match the amount himself due to his money &#34;being tied up in Soul Patrol Sweatshirts&#34;.)  The viewers met the donation goal (as of April 2, 2011, 2,026 donors had pledged $63,902&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;), with <a href="" title="NBC Universal">NBC Universal</a> also matching the $26,000, and Colbert, along with Fallon, Black Thought, <a href="" title="Taylor Hicks">Taylor Hicks</a>, and the <a href="" title="New York Knicks">New York Knicks</a> City Dancers, performed the song on the April 1, 2011 show.  During the performance, <a href="" title="Seth Herzog">Seth Herzog</a> held up a large placard with a <a href="" title="QR code">QR code</a> on it; the code led to a &#34;secret&#34; video where Jimmy thanked his viewers for their donations.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In a later segment of <i>The Colbert Report</i>, Colbert noticed that NBC used a picture of the &#34;Friday&#34; performance in <i>Late Night</i> s Emmy packet, and pointed out the irony of doing so since Fallon and Colbert would be up for Emmys in the same category.  Colbert then did a &#34;Thank You Note&#34; to Jimmy for promoting his show. On a later episode of <i>Late Night</i>, Jimmy wanted to remain &#34;fremmymies&#34; (a portmanteau of &#34;friend&#34; and &#34;Emmy&#34;) rather than &#34;emmymies&#34; and countered with his version of Colbert&#39;s &#34;The Wørd&#34; (which included &#34;Who are we kidding – neither of us is gonna beat <a href="" title="Jon Stewart">Jon Stewart</a>&#34;); the show then went to commercial with the logo <i>Late Night with Jimmy Falbert</i>.</p>
<p>When the six months was up, the pair became mortal enemies and went on each other&#39;s shows to feud. <a href="" title="Anderson Cooper">Anderson Cooper</a> appeared on both skits (claiming Italian restaurant <a href="" title="Sbarro">Sbarro</a> gives out free tickets to both shows when you buy a slice of pizza) asking each host if he could be their new friend, to which both replied &#34;No, Anderson, it&#39;s just too soon!&#34;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Shoe_Golf">Shoe Golf</span></h3>
<p>When Glenn Close was on the show, she told Jimmy about a new game called Shoe Golf she plays with her family.</p>
<p>Jimmy introduced &#34;shoe golf&#34; to Selena Gomez. Selena won with 6 &#34;strokes&#34; to Jimmy&#39;s 9.</p>
<p>Jimmy played a game of &#34;slipper golf&#34; with <a href="" title="Nicole Polizzi">Nicole Polizzi</a>. Jimmy won with 8 &#34;strokes&#34; to Polizzi&#39;s 10.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Brain_Storm">Brain Storm</span></h3>
<p>When <a href="" title="Anderson Cooper">Anderson Cooper</a> was a guest on the show, he talked about the time he and Jimmy were hanging out &#34;behind a combination <a href="" title="Pizza Hut">Pizza Hut</a>/<a href="" title="Taco Bell">Taco Bell</a>&#34; and found two headbands connected behind a glowing wire in a Dumpster.  The device allows them to look into each other&#39;s brains and let one person answer questions before the other asks them (e.g. Anderson: &#34;For a limited time only.&#34;  Jimmy: &#34;What was engraved on <a href="" title="Kim Kardashian">Kim Kardashian</a>&#39;s <a href="#Relationships" title="Kim Kardashian">wedding</a> ring?&#34;).  They then demonstrated the device.  The sketch is similar to <a href="" title="Johnny Carson">Johnny Carson</a>&#39;s &#34;<a href="" title="Carnac the Magnificent">Carnac the Magnificent</a>&#34; bits on <i><a href="" title="The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson">The Tonight Show</a></i>.
Jimmy later reprised the bit with other celebrities.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pearls_of_Wisdom_with_Goat_Leg_Greg_and_Gilvin_of_the_Tree"><i>Pearls of Wisdom with Goat Leg Greg and Gilvin of the Tree</i></span></h3>
<p>Jimmy dressed up as a pipe-smoking Scottish gentleman with one hairy, hooved leg and talked about <i><a href="" title="American Idol">American Idol</a></i>.  <a href="" title="Ewan McGregor">Ewan McGregor</a> played his companion Gilvin, who sat in a nest, wore a Robin Hood-style outfit and a page-boy wig, and played the recorder.  McGregor also wore false buck teeth, which he had difficulty keeping in his mouth.</p>

However, the show&#39;s support wasn&#39;t enough, as the Mocs lost the game 103–47.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/gamecenter/live/NCAAB_20090319_TNCHAT@CT" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/gamecenter/live/NCAAB_20090319_TNCHAT@CT">CBS Sports Game Summary - Round 1 - UTC / UConn</a>&#60;/ref&#62; Coach Shulman and the outgoing senior players attended the March 20th taping of the show as audience members and Jimmy had a brief conversation with the coach during the show.</p>

Jimmy&#39;s pick once again didn&#39;t make it past the first round, losing 102–87.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/gametracker/recap/NCAAB_20110318_LIU@NC" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/gametracker/recap/NCAAB_20110318_LIU@NC">No. 2 UNC rolls past a scrappy Long Island team</a> CBS Sports March 18, 2011&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p><i>Late Night</i> was in reruns the week before the tournament in 2012, so no underdog pick was made that year; however, Jimmy did a <a href="#Pros_and_Cons" title="">Pros and Cons</a> skit about March Madness upon his return.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="April_Fool.27s_Day_pranks">April Fool&#39;s Day pranks</span></h3>
<p>As an <a href="" title="April Fool&#39;s Day">April Fool&#39;s Day</a> prank in 2009, <a href="" title="Yoshi Amao">Yoshi Amao</a> came out and did the entire monologue in <a href="" title="Japanese language">Japanese</a> (with subtitles) instead of Jimmy. </p>
<p>In 2010, most of the band was shown lounging instead of playing the theme song during the introduction (the music was pre-recorded) while keyboardists <a href="" title="James Poyser">James Poyser</a> and <a href="" title="Kamal Gray">Kamal Gray</a> had a pretend boxing match.</p>
<p>In 2011, the band briefly played the theme song intentionally poorly and <a href="" title="Questlove">Questlove</a>&#39;s drumming &#34;stepped on&#34; Tariq&#39;s announcing of the episode number.  Shortly thereafter, Questlove announced &#34;April Fools!&#34; They finished the theme song as normal.</p>
<p>In 2012, April 1 fell on a weekend.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="If_Puppies_Could_Vote.2FPuppy_Predictors">If Puppies Could Vote/Puppy Predictors</span></h3>
<p>In the run-up to the <a href="" title="United States elections, 2010">2010 midterm elections</a>, Jimmy had five <a href="" title="Golden Retriever">Golden Retriever</a> puppies with human first and last names (Roger Blain, Brian Johnson, Kyle McAdams, Lisa Armstrong, and &#34;troublemaker&#34; Gary Frick) act as &#34;pundits&#34; to predict the winner of various races by choosing which of two bowls of dog food to eat from (blue for the Democrat and red for the Republican).  After he briefly went through the candidates&#39; positions, he released the puppies from a small cage. The puppies selected:
</p>
<ul>
<li>in the <a href="" title="United States Senate election in Nevada, 2010">Nevada Senate race</a>: <a href="" title="Harry Reid">Harry Reid</a>, 4-1 over <a href="" title="Sharron Angle">Sharron Angle</a>.</li>
<li>in the <a href="" title="United States Senate election in Illinois, 2010">Illinois Senate race</a>: <a href="" title="Mark Kirk">Mark Kirk</a>, 3-2 over <a href="" title="Alexi Giannoulias">Alexi Giannoulias</a>.</li>
<li>in the <a href="" title="United States Senate election in Pennsylvania, 2010">Pennsylvania Senate race</a>: <a href="" title="Joe Sestak">Joe Sestak</a>, 3-2 over <a href="" title="Pat Toomey">Pat Toomey</a>.</li>
<li>in the <a href="" title="New York gubernatorial election, 2010">New York Governor&#39;s race</a>: the original call was <a href="" title="Carl Paladino">Carl Paladino</a> 3-2 over <a href="" title="Andrew Cuomo">Andrew Cuomo</a>, but a review of the tape revealed one puppy (Gary Frick) had &#34;controversially&#34; <a href="" title="flip-flop (politics)">flip-flopped</a> and changed his vote, giving Cuomo the victory.</li></ul>

<p>The puppies correctly called three of the four races, only missing in the Sestak/Toomey race in Pennsylvania.</p>
<p>After the election, an &#34;attack ad&#34; (&#34;paid for by cats&#34;) surfaced slamming Gary Frick for his flip-flop in the Cuomo/Paladino race.</p>
<p>In a final bipartisan effort, he rewarded the puppies for their work by letting them eat out of a single bowl.</p>
<p>Jimmy also had the puppies predict the Best Picture winner of the <a href="" title="83rd Academy Awards">83rd Academy Awards</a>. They incorrectly predicted <i><a href="" title="Toy Story 3">Toy Story 3</a></i> (<i><a href="" title="The King&#39;s Speech">The King&#39;s Speech</a></i> was the actual winner).</p>
<p>Jimmy later had the puppies predict the results of the 2011 NFL season.  They incorrectly selected the <a href="" title="New England Patriots">New England Patriots</a> to be the winners of <a href="" title="Super Bowl XLVI">Super Bowl XLVI</a>. The Patriots did make it to the Super Bowl, but lost to the <a href="" title="New York Giants">New York Giants</a> by the score of 21-17.</p>
<p>On the February 24, 2011 episode, Jimmy had the puppies predict the Best Picture winner of the <a href="" title="84th Academy Awards">84th Academy Awards</a>. They incorrectly predicted <i><a href="" title="The Tree of Life (film)">The Tree of Life</a></i> (<i><a href="" title="The Artist (film)">The Artist</a></i> was the actual winner).</p>
<p>The night before the <a href="" title="United States presidential election, 2012">2012 U.S. presidential election</a>, Jimmy allowed Gary Frick (whom Jimmy has adopted as his own pet) to select the winner.  She (Gary Frick is actually a female dog) incorrectly picked <a href="" title="Mitt Romney">Mitt Romney</a> as the winner (<a href="" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> was re-elected).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Harry_Potter_Super_Fan_Contest"><i>Harry Potter</i> Super Fan Contest</span></h3>
<p>Jimmy brought down two self-professed fans of the <i>Harry Potter</i> series and had them compete at a series of contests to try to win a prize package provided by <a href="" title="Warner Brothers">Warner Brothers</a>.</p>

<ul>

<li>Guess the Title: Jimmy read the name of on the <i>Harry Potter</i> films as translated into a foreign language (<i><a href="" title="Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets">Harry Potter und die Kammer des Schreckens</a></i>) that the contestants had to identify for one point.</li>
<li>Repeat After the Living Painting: Jimmy brought out a &#34;living painting&#34; (Mike Dicenzo) who recited a recipe for Dragon Dung Fertilizer that the contestants had to remember and write down later, earning one point for each correct ingredient.</li></ul>

<p>Because the contestants were tied after round 3, they went to a tiebreaker, where they had to chug a pint of <a href="#Butterbeer" title="Harry Potter universe">butterbeer</a> as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The winner&#39;s prize was a three-day trip for two to <a href="" title="London">London</a>, staying at a four-star hotel, and the winner would film a <i>Harry Potter</i> movie scene.  The loser received a <i>Late Night</i> t-shirt.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Twelve_Things_of_2010">The Twelve Things of 2010</span></h3>

The sketch returned in 2011 as the &#34;<i>Late Night</i> Topical Carolers&#34;.</p>
