<p>The <b>Bloodhound</b> is a large <a href="" title="scent hound">scent hound</a> originally bred for hunting deer and wild boar, but also used from the Middle Ages onwards for tracking human beings, and now most often bred specifically for that purpose. Thought to be descended from hounds once kept at the Abbey of St Hubert in Belgium, it is known to French speakers as the <i>Chien de Saint-Hubert</i>. </p>
<p>This dog is famed for its ability to discern human odors even days later, over great distances, even across water. Its extraordinarily keen <a href="" title="olfaction">sense of smell</a> is combined with a strong and tenacious tracking instinct, producing the ideal scent hound, and it is used by police and law enforcement all over the world to track escaped prisoners, missing people, lost children and lost pets.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Appearance">Appearance</span></h2>

<p>Bloodhounds weigh from 33 to 50&#38;nbsp;kg (80 to 110&#38;nbsp;lbs), though some individuals weigh as much as 72&#38;nbsp;kg (160&#38;nbsp;lb). They stand 58 to 69&#38;nbsp;cm (23 to 27&#38;nbsp;inches) high at the <a href="" title="withers">withers</a>. Bloodhounds have a typical lifespan of about 9 to 11 years. According to the <a href="" title="American Kennel Club">AKC</a> standard of the breed, larger dogs are preferred by conformation judges. Acceptable colors for bloodhounds are black, liver, tan, or red. Bloodhounds possess an unusually large skeletal structure with most of their weight concentrated in their bones, which are very thick for their length. The coat typical for a scenthound is hard and composed of fur alone, with no admixture of hair.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Temperament">Temperament</span></h2>

<p>This breed is gentle, yet tireless when following a scent. Because of its strong tracking instinct, it can be willful and somewhat difficult to obedience train. Bloodhounds have an affectionate and even-tempered nature, making excellent family pets. However, like any pet, they require supervision when around small children.</p>

<p>Compared to other purebred dogs, Bloodhounds suffer an unusually high rate of gastrointestinal ailments, with <a href="" title="bloat">bloat</a> being the most common type of gastrointestinal problem.&#60;ref name=&#34;KC Survey&#34;&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570">http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570</a> Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee. 2004.

Owners should be especially aware of the signs of bloat, which is both the most common illness and the leading cause of death of Bloodhounds. To minimize bloat the owner should feed a Bloodhound at least an hour before or after exercise and place food and water in a raised feeder. The thick coat gives the breed the tendency to overheat quickly.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Chien_de_St_Hubert">Chien de St Hubert</span></h3>
<p>The St Hubert was, according to legend, first bred ca. 1000 AD by monks at the <a href="" title="Saint-Hubert, Belgium">Saint-Hubert</a> Monastery in Belgium; its origins are likely in France, home of many of modern <a href="" title="hound">hounds</a>. It is held to be the ancestor of several other breeds, like the extinct Norman hound, and Santongeois, and the modern Bleu de Gascogne, Gascon Santongeois, Ariegeois and Artois Normande, as well as the bloodhound. It has been suggested that it was a mixed breed, not at all uniform in type.&#60;ref name=Johnston&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Whether they originated there, or what their ancestry was, is uncertain, but from ca. 1200, the monks of the Abbey of <a href="" title="St Hubert">St Hubert</a> annually sent several pairs of black hounds as a gift to the King of France. They were not always highly thought of in the royal pack. <a href="" title="Charles IX of France">Charles IX</a> 1550-74, preferred his white hounds and the larger <a href="" title="Chien-gris">Chiens-gris</a>, and wrote that the St Huberts were suitable for people with gout to follow, but not for those who wished to shorten the life of the hunted animal. He described them as pack-hounds of medium stature, long in the body, not well sprung in the rib, and of no great strength.&#60;ref name=Charles&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;  Writing in 1561 Jaques du Fouilloux describes them as strong of body, but with low, short legs. He says they have become mixed in breeding, so that they are now of all colours and widely distributed.&#60;ref name=Livre&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Charles described the &#39;true race&#39; of the St Hubert as black, with red/tawny marks above the eyes and legs usually of the same colour, suggesting a &#39;blanket&#39; black and tan (see Section on Colour Types below). To De Fouilloux the &#39;pure black&#39; were the best of this mixed breed. Both writers thought them only useful as leash hounds. They both  refer to a white hound, also a St Hubert, which by their time had disappeared, having been interbred with another white hound, the greffier, to produce the king’s preferred pack hound, sometimes called the chien blanc du roi.</p>
<p>They appear to have been more highly thought of during the reign of <a href="" title="Henry IV of France">Henry IV</a> (1553–1610), who presented a pack to <a href="" title="James I of England">James I of England</a>. By the end of the reign of <a href="" title="Louis XIV">Louis XIV</a> (1715), they were already rare.&#60;ref name=Manuel&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=Expo&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; In 1788, D’Yauville, who was master of the Royal hounds, says those sent by the St Hubert monks, once much prized, had degenerated, and scarcely one of the annual gift of six or eight was kept.&#60;ref name=Hounds&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Upon the <a href="" title="French Revolution">French Revolution</a> of 1789, the gifts ceased, and hunting in France went into a decline until the end of the <a href="" title="Napoleonic wars">Napoleonic wars</a>. When it recovered during the 19th Century, huntsmen, with many breeds to choose from, seem to have had little interest in the St Hubert. An exception was Baron Le Couteulx de Canteleu, who tried to find them. He reported that there were hardly any in France, and those in the Ardennes were so cross-bred that they had lost the characteristics of the breed.&#60;ref name=Expo/&#62;&#60;ref name=Bloodhound/&#62;</p>
<p>Writers on the bloodhound in the last two centuries generally agreed that the original St Hubert strain died out in the nineteenth century, and that the European St Hubert owes its present existence to the development of the Bloodhound.&#60;ref name=Manuel/&#62;&#60;ref name=Bloodhound&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=Lowe&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=Brey&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Bloodhound">Bloodhound</span></h3>
<p>References to bloodhounds first appear in English writing in the mid 14th century, in contexts that suggest the breed was well established by then.&#60;ref name=Werwolf&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=Green&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; It is often claimed that its ancestors were brought over from <a href="" title="Normandy">Normandy</a> by <a href="" title="William the Conqueror">William the Conqueror</a>, but there is no actual evidence for this. That the <a href="" title="Normans">Normans</a> brought hounds from Europe during the post-Conquest period is virtually certain, but whether they included the Bloodhound itself, rather than merely its ancestors, is a matter of dispute that probably cannot be resolved on the basis of surviving evidence.</p>
<p>In <a href="#The_hound" title="Medieval hunting">Medieval hunting</a> the <a href="" title="Dog type">typical use</a> of the Bloodhound was as a ‘<a href="" title="limer">limer</a>’, or ‘lyam-hound’, that is a dog handled on a leash or ‘lyam’, to find  the <a href="" title="hart (deer)">hart</a> or <a href="" title="Wild boar">boar</a> before it was hunted by the pack hounds (<a href="" title="rache">raches</a>).&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/glossary.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://info.sjc.ox.ac.uk/forests/glossary.htm">Forests and Chases of England and Wales: A Glossary.</a> St John&#39;s College, Oxford.&#60;/ref&#62; It  was prized for its ability to hunt the cold scent of an individual animal, and, though it did not usually take part in the kill, it was given a special reward from the carcase.&#60;ref name=Turbervile&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>It also seems that from the earliest times the Bloodhound was used to track people. There are stories written in Medieval Scotland of <a href="" title="Robert the Bruce">Robert the Bruce</a> (in 1307), and <a href="" title="William Wallace">William Wallace</a> (1270–1305) being followed by &#39;sleuth hounds’.&#60;ref name=Barbour&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=Minstrel&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Whether true or not, these stories show that the <a href="" title="sleuth hound">sleuth hound</a> was already known as a man-trailer, and it later becomes clear that the sleuth hound and the Bloodhound were the same animal.</p>
<p><img src="" alt="English Bloodhound 1563" title="English Bloodhound 1563" class="location-right type-thumb" />

<div class="thumbcaption">English Bloodhound 1563</div>In the 16th century, <a href="" title="John Caius">John Caius</a>,&#60;ref name=Caius&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; in unquestionably the most important single source in the history of the Bloodhound, describes its hanging ears and lips, its use in game parks to follow the scent of blood, which gives it its name, its ability to track thieves and poachers by their foot scent, how it casts if it has lost the scent when thieves cross water, and its use on the Scottish borders to track cross-border raiders, known as <a href="" title="Border Reivers">Border Reivers</a>. This links it to the sleuth hound,&#60;ref name=Boece&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; and from Caius also comes the information that the English Bloodhound and the sleuth hound were essentially the same, though the Bloodhound was slightly bigger, with more variation in coat colour.&#60;ref name=Ash&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The picture on the right was published in Zurich in 1563, in <a href="" title="Conrad Gesner">Conrad Gesner</a>&#39;s <i>Thierbuch</i> (a compendium of animals) with the captions: &#39;Englischen Blüthund&#39; and &#39;Canis Sagax Sanguinarius apud Anglos&#39; (English scent hound with associations of blood). It was drawn by, or under the supervision of, John Caius, and sent to Gesner with other drawings to illustrate his descriptions of British dogs for European readers. It is thus the earliest known picture published specifically to demonstrate the appearance of the Bloodhound. We are told it was done from life,&#60;ref name=Ash/&#62; and detail such as the soft hang of the ear indicates it was carefully observed. Fully accurate or not, it suggests changes between the Bloodhound of then and today. The collar and long coiled rope reflect the Bloodhound’s typical functions as a limer or leashed man-trailer in that period.</p>

<p>The earliest known report of a trial of the Bloodhound&#39;s trailing abilities comes from the scientist <a href="" title="Robert Boyle">Robert Boyle</a><a class="externallink" href="http://bloodhounds.org.uk/History/90.htm#IX" rel="nofollow" title="http://bloodhounds.org.uk/History/90.htm#IX"><a class="externallink" href="http://bloodhounds.org.uk/History/90.htm#IX" rel="nofollow" title="http://bloodhounds.org.uk/History/90.htm#IX">http://bloodhounds.org.uk/History/90.htm#IX</a></a>, who described how a Bloodhound tracked a man seven miles along a route frequented by people, and found him in an upstairs room of a house.&#60;ref name=Boyle&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>With the rise of fox-hunting, the decline of deer-hunting, and the extinction of the wild boar, as well as a more settled state of society, the use of the Bloodhound diminished. It was kept by the aristocratic owners of a few <a href="" title="Medieval deer park">deer-parks</a>&#60;ref name=&#34;Boyle&#34;/&#62; and by a few enthusiasts,&#60;ref name=Expo/&#62; with some variation in type, until its popularity began to increase again with the rise of dog-showing in the 19th Century.&#60;ref name=Manuel/&#62; Numbers, however, have remained low in Britain. Very few survived the <a href="" title="Second World War">Second World War</a>, but the gene-pool has gradually been replenished with imports from America. Nevertheless, because of UK <a href="" title="quarantine">quarantine</a> restrictions, importing was expensive and difficult, throughout the 20th century, and in the post-war period exports to the USA, and to Europe where the population had also been affected by the war, considerably exceeded imports.&#60;ref&#62;Kennel Club Breed Record Supplements&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

During the later 19th century numbers of Bloodhounds were imported from Britain by French enthusiasts, who regretted the extinction of the ancient St Hubert. They wished to re-establish it, using the Bloodhound, which, despite its developments in Britain, they regarded as the St Hubert preserved unchanged. Many of the finest specimens were bought and exhibited and bred in France as Chiens de S. Hubert, especially by Le Couteulx de Canteleu, who himself bred over 300. Whatever few original St Huberts remained either died out or were absorbed into the new population.&#60;ref name=Expo/&#62;&#60;ref name=Bloodhound/&#62; As a result, the Bloodhound became known on parts of the Continent as the Chien de Saint-Hubert. In the mid 20th century the Brussels-based FCI accepted the claim of Belgium to be the country of origin. There are now annual celebrations in the town of Saint-Hubert, in which handlers in period dress parade their hounds. In Britain the bloodhound has continued to be seen as a native breed, with European St Huberts being accepted by the UK KC as bloodhounds.&#60;ref&#62;<i>The Bloodhound, the St Hubert and the FCI</i>, in Barwick M: <a class="externallink" href="http://bloodhounds.org.uk/History/MB-AspectsUS.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://bloodhounds.org.uk/History/MB-AspectsUS.pdf"><i>Aspects of Bloodhound History</i></a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In Le Couteulx’ book of 1890 we read that ‘Le Chien de St Hubert actuel’ is very big, from  0m,69 to 0m,80 (27½-31½in) high.&#60;ref name=Manuel/&#62; This does not accord with the 16th century descriptions of the St Hubert given above, nor with the FCI standard, but the idea that the St Hubert is much bigger (up to 0.915m, 36 in) than the Bloodhound persisted well into the 20th century, among some St Hubert enthusiasts.&#60;ref&#62;<i>Master of the Hounds</i> Article on Christiane Barnard, <i>American Bloodhound Club Bulletin</i> summer 1989&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>When the first Bloodhounds were exported to the USA is not known. Bloodhounds were used to track runaway slaves before the <a href="" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a>, but it has been questioned whether the dogs used were genuine Bloodhounds. However, in the later part of the 19th century, and in the next, more pure Bloodhounds were introduced from Britain, and bred in America, especially after 1888, when the English breeder, Edwin Brough, brought three of his hounds to exhibit at the <a href="" title="Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show">Westminster KC show</a> in New York City. He went into partnership with Mr J L Winchell, who with other Americans, imported more stock from Britain.&#60;ref name=Brey/&#62; Bloodhounds in America have been more widely used in tracking lost people and criminals - often with brilliant success - than in Britain, and the history of the Bloodhound in America is full of the man-trailing exploits of outstanding Bloodhounds and their expert handlers, the most famous hound being Nick Carter.&#60;ref name=Brey/&#62;&#60;ref name=Whitney&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Law enforcement agencies have been much involved in the use of Bloodhounds, and there is a <a class="externallink" href="http://www.npba.com" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.npba.com">National Police Bloodhound Association</a>, originating in 1962.&#60;ref name=Tolhurst&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">Bloodhound trial in the UK. Hound and handler approach their quarry (the photographer), with judges following behind.</div></p>
<p>In Britain there have been instances from time to time of the successful use of the Bloodhound to track criminals or missing people. However man-trailing is enjoyed as a sport by British Bloodhound owners, through national working trials, and this enthusiasm has spread to Europe. In addition, while the pure Bloodhound is used to hunt singly, bloodhound packs use bloodhounds crossed with foxhounds to hunt the human scent.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Bloodhound has become widely distributed internationally, though numbers are small in most countries, with more in the USA than anywhere else. Following the spread of the Bloodhound from Britain in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, imports and exports and, increasingly, artificial insemination, are maintaining the world population as a common breeding stock, without a great deal of divergence in type in different countries.</p>
<p>Bloodhounds are now coloured red, black and tan or liver and tan; however, until <a href="" title="Elizabethan">Elizabethan</a> times they also occurred in other solid colours, including white, and all other hound colours.&#60;ref name=Topsell&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; It is possible that the <a href="" title="Talbot (dog)">Talbot</a>, now extinct, was a white Bloodhound, but this is uncertain.</p>
<p>During the late 19th century, Bloodhounds were frequent subjects for artists such as <a href="" title="Edwin Landseer">Edwin Landseer</a>&#60;ref name=Paint&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; and <a href="" title="Briton Riviere">Briton Riviere</a>; the dogs depicted are close in appearance to modern Bloodhounds, indicating that the essential character of the Bloodhound predates modern dog breeding. However, the dogs depicted by Landseer show less wrinkle and <a href="" title="Nictitating membrane">haw</a> than modern dogs.&#60;ref name=Brey/&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Origin_Issues">Origin Issues</span></h3>

<p>Throughout most of its history the bloodhound was seen as a dog of English or Anglo-Scottish origin, either of unknown ancestry,&#60;ref name=Caius/&#62;&#60;ref name=Cyno&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=Gesner&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=Lee&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; or, more recently, as developed in part from the St Hubert.&#60;ref name=Bloodhound/&#62;&#60;ref name=Jesse&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; &#60;ref name=Whitney/&#62;&#60;ref name=Lowe/&#62;&#60;ref name=Dalziel&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; It was only in the 19th century that it was claimed, primarily by Le Couteulx, to be the St Hubert itself.&#60;ref name=Manuel/&#62; Medieval hunting pictures show raches and limers, of the general sagax type, with hanging ears and lips, but not having the specific characteristics of the bloodhound. 16th century descriptions of the St Hubert as short-legged, and only medium sized&#60;ref name=Livre/&#62;&#60;ref name=Charles/&#62;&#60;ref name=Cotgrave&#62;  &#60;/ref&#62;have led to speculation that the main European antecedent of the bloodhound was rather the Norman hound, which was very large, than the St  Hubert.&#60;ref name=Hounds/&#62; Others such as the sleuth-hound, the Talbot, the <a href="" title="Chien-gris">dun-hound</a>&#60;ref name=Lowe/&#62; and the southern hound, as well as pack hounds, have also been supposed to have contributed to its make-up. Some writers doubt whether anything certain can be said about specific breed ancestry beyond the last few centuries.&#60;ref name=Whitney/&#62;&#60;ref name=Genetics&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=Dalziel/&#62; The picture given by Le Couteulx and D’Yauville of the St Hubert was that it changed considerably through mixed breeding, and perhaps degenerated, before its disappearance,&#60;ref name=Manuel/&#62;&#60;ref name=Hounds/&#62; while the bloodhound which replaced it, preserved its original character. However, it is apparent from 16th century pictures that the bloodhound itself has changed considerably.&#60;ref name=Gesner/&#62;&#60;ref name=Turbervile/&#62; The modern St Hubert is the English bloodhound, in descent and type. Generally, national and regional variants of hounds, terriers, spaniels etc have been recognised as separate breeds, France in particular having many regional breeds of hound;&#60;ref name=Johnston/&#62;&#60;ref name=Hounds/&#62; the bloodhound’s identification as the St Hubert makes it an anomaly in this respect. Whether the bloodhound is British or Belgian in origin is ultimately not something one can prove historically, depending as it does on whether one chooses to regard two related animals differing in tradition, and history, and somewhat in type, as separate breeds, or variants of the same one.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Breed_standards">Breed standards</span></h3>
<p>Descriptions of the desirable physical qualities of a hunting hound go back to Medieval books on hunting.&#60;ref name=Turbervile/&#62; All dogs used in the hunting field were &#39;gentle&#39;,&#60;ref name=Caius/&#62; that is of good breeding (not necessarily pure breeding), and parents were carefully chosen to maintain and improve conformation. In 1896, making some use of wording found in earlier descriptions, Edwin Brough and Dr J Sidney Turner published <i>Points and Characteristics of the Bloodhound or Sleuth-Hound</i>.&#60;ref name=ABB&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;  This was adopted by the newly-formed Association of Bloodhound Breeders, and ultimately became, with very little change, the &#39;official&#39; breed standard of the KC and the AKC.
Meanwhile, the Belgian or Dutch Comte Henri de Bylandt, or H A graaf van Bylandt, published <i>Races des Chiens</i>&#60;ref name=Bylandt&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; in 1897, a huge and very important illustrated compilation of breed descriptions, or standards. In this French edition the Bloodhound appears as the Chien de St Hubert, although the pictures illustrating the standard are all of British Bloodhounds, many of them those of Edwin Brough. The book was revised and reprinted in four languages in 1904, and in this edition the English text of the standard is  that of the Association of Bloodhound Breeders, while the French text is closely based on it. However, the present FCI standard uses a quite different layout and wording.
The AKC standard has hardly been altered from the original of 1896, the principal change being that the colours, &#39;black and tan&#39;, &#39;red and tan&#39;, and &#39;tawny&#39;, have been renamed as &#39;black and tan&#39;, &#39;liver and tan&#39;, and &#39;red&#39;, but the British KC <a class="externallink" href="http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk">http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk</a></a> has made considerable changes. Some of these were simply matters of presentation and did not affect content. However, responding to the view that the requirements of some breed standards were potentially detrimental to the health or well-being of the animal, changes have been made affecting the required eye-shape and the loose skin, the most recent revision being 2008-9.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Derivation_of_name">Derivation of name</span></h3>
<p>The word &#39;bloodhound&#39; is recorded from c1350.&#60;ref name=Werwolf/&#62;&#60;ref&#62;Oxford English Dictionary&#60;/ref&#62; Most recent accounts say that its <a href="" title="etymological">etymological</a> meaning is ‘hound of pure or noble blood’. This derives from an original suggestion of Le Couteulx de Canteleu&#60;ref name=Manuel/&#62;&#60;ref name=Bloodhound/&#62; in the nineteenth century, which has been enthusiastically and uncritically espoused by later writers, perhaps because it absolved this undoubtedly good-natured dog from suggestions of bloodthirstiness. Neither Le Couteulx nor anyone since has offered any historical evidence to support <a href="" title="False etymology">this view</a>. The suggestion sometimes seen&#60;ref name=Whitney/&#62; that the word derives from &#39;blooded hound&#39; is without basis, as the expression does not appear in early English, and &#39;blooded&#39; in this meaning is not found before the nineteenth century. Before then &#39;bloodhound&#39; had been taken to mean, &#39;hound for blood&#39;, or ‘blood-seeking hound’. This was the explanation put forward by John Caius,&#60;ref name=Caius/&#62; who was one of the most learned men of his time, and had an interest in etymology, in the sixteenth century. It is supported by considerable historical linguistic evidence, which can be gleaned from such sources as the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (<i><a href="" title="OED">OED</a></i>): the fact that first uses of the word ‘blood’ to refer to good breeding in an animal post date the first use of ‘Bloodhound’; that other comparable uses, as in ‘blood-horse’ and ‘blood-stock’ appear many centuries later; and that derogatory uses of the word ‘Bloodhound’, which any suggestion of noble breeding would sadly weaken, appear from as early as c1400.&#60;ref&#62;Anonymous (c1400) <i><a href="" title="Alliterative Morte Arthure">Alliterative Morte Arthure</a> (line 3640)</i><a class="externallink" href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/AnoMort.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/AnoMort.html"><a class="externallink" href="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/AnoMort.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/AnoMort.html">http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/toc/modeng/public/AnoMort.html</a></a><a class="externallink" href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/AllitMA/1:66?rgn=div1;view=fulltext" rel="nofollow" title="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/AllitMA/1:66?rgn=div1;view=fulltext"><a class="externallink" href="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/AllitMA/1:66?rgn=div1;view=fulltext" rel="nofollow" title="http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/AllitMA/1:66?rgn=div1;view=fulltext">http://quod.lib.umich.edu/c/cme/AllitMA/1:66?rgn=div1;view=fulltext</a></a>.&#60;/ref&#62; Other early sources tell us that hounds were supposed to have an interest in blood, and that the Bloodhound was used to follow the trail of a wounded animal.&#60;ref name=Minstrel/&#62;&#60;ref name=Jesse/&#62;  In the absence of anything in early usage, or any historical evidence whatsoever, to support the modern explanation, the older must be regarded as correct.&#60;ref&#62;<i>The Derivation of the Word &#34;Bloodhound&#34;</i>, in Barwick M : <a class="externallink" href="http://bloodhounds.org.uk/History/MB-AspectsUS.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://bloodhounds.org.uk/History/MB-AspectsUS.pdf"><i>Aspects of Bloodhound History</i></a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Colour-types">Colour-types</span></h2>
<p>See Main Article <a href="" title="Coat (dog)">Coat (dog)</a></p>
<p>Up to at least the seventeenth century bloodhounds were of all colours,&#60;ref name=Topsell/&#62; but in modern times the colour range has become more restricted. The colours are usually listed as black and tan, liver and tan and red. White is not uncommon on the chest, and sometimes appears on the feet. Genetically, the main types are determined by the action of two genes, found in many species. One produces an alternation between black and brown (liver). If a hound inherits the black allele (variant) from either parent, it has a black nose, eye rims and paw-pads, and if it has a saddle, it is black. The other allele suppresses black pigment and is recessive, so it must be inherited from both parents. It produces liver noses, eye rims, paw-pads, and saddles.</p>
<p>The second gene determines coat pattern. It can produce animals with no saddle (essentially all-tan, but called ‘red’ in bloodhounds); ones with saddle-marking; or ones largely covered with darker (black or liver) pigment, except for tan lips, eyebrows, forechest and lower legs. These last are sometimes referred to as ‘blanket’ or ‘full-coat’ types. In a pioneering study in 1969&#60;ref&#62;Piper, Dennis (1969)<i>Colour Inheritance in the Bloodhound</i> Available from The Bloodhound Club, UK&#60;/ref&#62; Dennis Piper suggested 5 alleles in the pattern-marking gene, producing variants from the red or saddle-less hound through three different types of progressively greater saddle marking to the ‘blanket’ type. However, more modern study&#60;ref name=Genetics/&#62; attributes the variation to 3 different alleles of the <a href="" title="Agouti gene">Agouti gene</a>.  A&#60;sup&#62;y&#60;/sup&#62; produces the non saddle-marked &#34;red&#34; hound, A&#60;sup&#62;s&#60;/sup&#62; produces saddle-marking, and a&#60;sup&#62;t&#60;/sup&#62; produces the blanket or full-coat hound.  Of these A&#60;sup&#62;y&#60;/sup&#62;  is dominant, and a&#60;sup&#62;t&#60;/sup&#62; is recessive to the others. The interaction of these variants of the two genes produces the six basic types shown below.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Scenting_ability">Scenting ability</span></h2>

<p>The Bloodhound&#39;s physical characteristics account for its ability to follow a scent trail left several days in the past. Under optimal conditions, a Bloodhound can detect as few as one or two cells. The Bloodhound&#39;s nasal chambers (where scents are identified) are larger than those of most other breeds. The large, long pendent ears serve to prevent wind from scattering nearby skin cells while the dog&#39;s nose is on the ground; the folds  of wrinkled flesh under the lips and neck—called the shawl—serve to catch stray scent particles in the air or on a nearby branch as the Bloodhound is scenting, reinforcing the scent in the dog&#39;s memory and nose.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The number of <a href="" title="olfactory">olfactory</a> <a href="" title="receptor (biochemistry)">receptor</a> <a href="" title="cell (biology)">cells</a> are 4 billion in a bloodhound, compared to just 5 million in a human and 100 million in a <a href="" title="rabbit">rabbit</a>&#60;ref name=&#34;autogenerated2004&#34;&#62;Shier, D., Butler, J. and Lewis, R.

<p>The surface area of bloodhound olfactory <a href="" title="epithelium">epithelium</a> is 59 sq.in. compared to human&#39;s 1.55 sq.in. (10 sq.cm.)&#60;ref name=&#34;autogenerated2004&#34;/&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Voice">Voice</span></h2>
<p>A common misconception is that Bloodhounds are employed in packs; while this is sometimes the case in Britain, in North America, Bloodhounds are used as solitary trackers. When they are on a trail, they are usually silent and do not give voice as other scenthounds. The original use of the Bloodhound as a leash-hound, to find but not disturb animals, would require silent trailing.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the Bloodhound bay is among the most impressive of hound voices. When hunting in a pack they are expected to be in full cry. They are more likely to &#39;give tongue,&#39; &#39;throw their tongue,&#39; or &#39;speak&#39; when hunting in a pack than when hunting singly, and more when hunting free than when on the leash. The quality of &#39;speaking to the line&#39;, that is giving tongue when on the correct scent while remaining silent when off it, is valued in British Bloodhound circles, on aesthetic grounds and because it makes it very easy to &#39;read&#39; the hound&#39;s tracking behaviour. As a result special trophies for speaking to the correct line are on offer at British working trials (where hounds hunt singly), although rarely awarded.</p>

<div class="thumbcaption">The Coakham pack of bloodhounds starting a human trail in England</div>The Medieval bloodhound was not primarily a pack hound, but a leash hound, though there may have been packs in different places or at different times. Up to the 19th century, a single hound or a brace was used on deer-parks, to find deer for the gun. However,  mid century two packs appeared, that of Thomas Neville, who hunted in the <a href="" title="New Forest">New Forest</a> area, and who preferred very black hounds, and that of <a href="" title="George Glyn, 2nd Baron Wolverton">Lord Wolverton</a>. Both these hunted semi-domesticated deer (‘carted deer’), which were recaptured on being brought to bay, and returned home. It was said of Lord Wolverton&#39;s hounds that he found it difficult to get them to hunt as a pack, because each liked to follow the scent on his own.&#60;ref name=Lowe/&#62; Eventually, many were sold to Le Couteulx de Canteleu and taken to France.  Around the start of the 20th century, several packs existed briefly, following either deer, or the <a href="" title="Hunting the Clean Boot">‘clean boot’</a> - individual human scent without any enhancement such as animal blood or aniseed.&#60;ref name=bloodhounds&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Since the second world war there have been several packs, perhaps most notably that of Eric Furness, who introduced a cross to a <a href="" title="Dumfriesshire Hound">Dumfriesshire foxhound</a> into his Peak Bloodhounds.&#60;ref name=Lowe/&#62; Generally, masters of bloodhounds since then maintain a level of outcross breeding in their packs to improve speed and agility, while retaining bloodhound type. These packs hunt the clean boot and are followed by a field on horseback.</p>
