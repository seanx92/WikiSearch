<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot">Plot</span></h2>

<p>Each episode begins in much the same way with a short sequence in which Digby is awoken by an elaborate alarm system, then tries in vain to prevent the paperboy throwing his newspaper into a puddle. Similarly the episodes all end in the same way with a short sequence in which the editor inspects a newspaper front page expecting to see a great story, but is instead frustrated when it shows instead a picture depicting the results of Digby&#39;s clumsiness and mistakes, at which point the character played by <a href="" title="Mark Benton">Mark Benton</a> shouts &#34;DIGBY DIGWORTH!&#34;.</p>
<p>In every series 1 episode, Digby and Hacker have to turn to the mysterious Sid the Source when in trouble, who considers covering his face from the public. Hacker often mistakes Sid the Source as a sauce topping, so every time Digby said &#34;Every reporter needs a source.&#39;, Hacker holds up a different type of sauce each episode.</p>
