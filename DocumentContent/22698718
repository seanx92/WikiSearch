<h1>Subatomic Sound System</h1>

<p> 
 </p>
<p>Founded in 1999, <b>Subatomic Sound System</b> brought together musicians, producers, DJs and visual artists from a variety of backgrounds and traditions primarily based in New York City and Brooklyn to form a record label and collective that built on a combination of new music technology and traditional instruments to produce music across a variety of genres, often combining genres, in an effort to adapt 1970sâ€™ Jamaican sound system culture and dub reggae studio techniques to current music genres and forms of live performance. In fall 2008, Subatomic Sound System garnered international attention for a limited edition vinyl 12&#34; featuring their collaboration with Vienna&#39;s Dubblestandart and dub reggae inventor <a href="" title="Lee &amp;quot;Scratch&amp;quot; Perry">Lee &#34;Scratch&#34; Perry</a>, releasing the first songs from Perry in the <a href="" title="dubstep">dubstep</a> genre, one of the first recorded examples of a tangible connection between the popular UK based electronic genre that emerged in the begin of the first decade of the 21st century and the Jamaican dub reggae from the 1970s where dubstep&#39;s origins were rooted and which had been primarily originated by Perry himself.  Beginning in 2008, Subatomic Sound System started hosting weekly radio shows on 91.5fm, Radio New York and webcast on Brooklyn Radio.</p>

<p>Fall 2001: Subatomic Sound System  won the <a href="" title="Red Bull">Red Bull</a> Vinyl Lab competition in New York City using an early incarnation of <a href="" title="Native Instruments">Native Instruments</a> Traktor DJ software on a laptop at a time when laptops were not commonly used in musical performance.  When judges discovered software had been used to create the mix CD, it sparked a controversy amongst the judges. In the end, judges conceded that there was no valid grounds for disqualifying Subatomic Sound System for using DJ software rather than traditional vinyl and turntables, so they upheld their victory in the competition.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=subatomic_us" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.native-instruments.com/index.php?id=subatomic_us">Native Instruments article on Red Bull Vinyl Lab competition</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>From 2007 to the present:  Subatomic Sound System increased touring throughout North America and Europe in a variety of configurations from live band of ten, to electronic trio, to DJs as styles like <a href="" title="dubstep">dubstep</a> increased in popularity and the interest in new <a href="" title="dub music">dub</a> oriented music emanating from New York City increased (largely the result of successful releases from NYC artists such as Dr. Israel, <a href="" title="Victor Axelrod">Ticklah</a>, <a href="" title="Easy Star All-Stars">Easy Star All-Stars</a>, Dub Gabriel, <a href="" title="Bill Laswell">Bill Laswell</a>, <a href="" title="Matisyahu">Matisyahu</a>, and others).</p>
<p>July 19, 2009: Subatomic Sound System performed to a beyond capacity crowd at <a href="" title="Summerstage">Summerstage</a> in <a href="" title="Central Park">Central Park</a>, <a href="" title="New York City">New York City</a>, along with Lee &#34;Scratch&#34; Perry &#38; Dubblestandart (with a cameo from <a href="" title="Ari Up">Ari Up</a>) as well as <a href="" title="Alpha Blondy">Alpha Blondy</a>. The lineup for this event drew the largest Summerstage crowd of the season, confirming organizers&#39; expectations. Given the multicultural and cross generational audiences who turn out in Central Park, organizers had hoped this billing would draw on the connection between modern incarnations of <a href="" title="dub music">dub</a> based music such as dubstep and the <a href="" title="dub reggae">dub reggae</a> and <a href="" title="roots reggae">roots reggae</a> styles from over 30 years before, originated by Perry in Jamaica that influenced artists like Blondy to extend that sound in <a href="" title="Africa">Africa</a>. Those styles then influenced groups like Dubblestandart and Subatomic Sound System in Europe and the U.S.A. to meld that sound with other contemporary electronic based genres.&#60;ref&#62;Summerstage event page for Subatomic Sound System, Lee Scratch Perry &#38; Dubblestandart, and Alpha Blondy <a class="externallink" href="http://www.summerstage.org/index1.aspx?BD=21379" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.summerstage.org/index1.aspx?BD=21379"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.summerstage.org/index1.aspx?BD=21379" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.summerstage.org/index1.aspx?BD=21379">http://www.summerstage.org/index1.aspx?BD=21379</a></a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Beginning in 2008, Subatomic Sound System started Subatomic Sound Radio, hosting weekly radio shows on 91.5FM, Radio New York and Brooklyn Radio webcasts. The Radio New York show is part of a nightly program called <i>Mo&#39;Glo</i> sponsored by Seattle based public radio station <a href="" title="KEXP">KEXP</a>.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Iron_Devil:_Lee_.26quot.3BScratch.26quot.3B_Perry.27s_first_dubstep_track">Iron Devil: Lee &#34;Scratch&#34; Perry&#39;s first dubstep track</span></h3>
<p>In fall of 2008, Subatomic Sound System produced a collaborative remix in a dubstep style with Vienna&#39;s Dubblestandart &#38; dub reggae originator Lee &#34;Scratch&#34; Perry who were working jointly on completing an album entitled <i>Return From Planet Dub</i> which included new versions of several of Perry&#39;s most famous tunes and riddims from his hey day in Jamaica during the 1970s. The Subatomic Sound System remix was Perry&#39;s first release in the dubstep style that by late 2008 had spread from the UK and was beginning to see worldwide popularity among electronic music fans and an ever growing crowd of curious music listeners. The remix was titled &#34;Iron Devil&#34; and was based on the riddim used for some of Lee&#39;s biggest hits like &#34;Disco Devil&#34;, &#34;<a href="" title="Chase The Devil">Chase The Devil</a>&#34; with <a href="" title="Max Romeo">Max Romeo</a>, and &#34;Croaking Lizard&#34; from Lee&#39;s seminal <i><a href="" title="Super Ape">Super Ape</a></i> album. A short run of those records was pressed as advance promotion for the forthcoming album and included some exclusive vinyl only mixes, namely dubstep and 1980s <a href="" title="dancehall">dancehall</a> reggae style mixes of &#34;Iron Devil&#34; on the A side and two remixes of Dubblestandart tracks by Tom Watson, a producer from Paris, France, on the B side, one of which was &#34;Wadada&#34; (originally recorded by <a href="" title="Dub Syndicate">Dub Syndicate</a>) the first ever dubstep track featuring the Jamaican voice of thunder, <a href="" title="Prince Far-I">Prince Far-I</a> .</p>
<p>The limited edition vinyl 12&#34; was distributed in either a blank white jacket or, for about 150 copies, in a vintage red, gold and green comic art jacket that was acquired from <a href="" title="Tuff Gong">Tuff Gong</a> in Jamaica and bore the Solographic Productions imprint (leading some stores to incorrectly list Solographic as the label for the release). The record itself had a blank white label marked on only on the A-side by a devil head hand stamped on it with red ink. It sold out in less than a week and it quickly became highly sought after on secondary vinyl markets and vinyl collectors&#39; sites such as <a href="" title="Discogs">Discogs</a>.

<p>The release has historical significance for several reasons. Firstly, at the age of 73, Perry was suddenly finding new audiences for his music worldwide through the evolution of dub reggae into dubstep. Secondly, its popularity was indicative of a cultural diaspsora and evolution of a non-commercial sub-genre of music developed in Jamaica largely by Perry into a movement that had rippled around the world through various music genres to later create a sub-genre of electronic music called dubstep over 30 years later in the UK that reunited its offspring with their forefather and propelled them both to broader prominence that in the process crossed cultural, generational and racial boundaries.</p>

<p>In July 2009, another 12&#34; was released that featured dubstep tracks based on &#34;Blackboard Jungle&#34;, the title track of <a href="" title="The Upsetters">The Upsetters</a>&#39; album <i>Blackboard Jungle Dub</i> produced by Perry and considered by some  to be the first ever dub album. The original <i>Blackboard Jungle Dub</i> album from the 1970s was mastered and re-released as <i><a href="" title="Upsetters 14 Dub Blackboard Jungle">Upsetters 14 Dub Blackboard Jungle</a></i> and the tune &#34;Blackboard Jungle&#34; was renamed &#34;Black Panta&#34;. Dubblestandart remade the tune in collaboration with Perryon their album <i>Return From Planet Dub</i> in spring 2009. That release also had remixes of the song by Subatomic Sound System. For the dubstep vinyl release that followed, Subatomic Sound System developed new versions of &#34;Blackboard Jungle&#34; based on that remix and involving Guyana-born/NYC-based dancehall reggae vocalist Jahdan Blakkamoore for vocals along with Perry. The vinyl release 12&#34; catalog number was SS009 and was followed up in 2010 by digital releases SS010 and SS011 that featured alternative versions. A mini-documentary featuring Perry covering the making of the &#34;Iron Devil&#34; and &#34;Blackboard Jungle&#34; dubstep remixes with Dubblestandart and Subatomic Sound System, their capacity crowd performance in Central Park, and the evolution of dub to dubstep, was created and released on the internet via sites like YouTube.</p>

<p>In late 2011, the Subatomic Sound label released a project called Sancocho e Tigres, a collective of young producers from across South and Central America who are electronic music producers as well as players of instruments.  The project was organized by Caballo (Rebel Records) from Colombia.  Subatomic Sound put out two releases, one of a single, &#34;Lujo De Pobre&#34;, that included a song as well as the self produced samples by the collective members used to create the song. A second release followed with various versions of the song that each member put together from those same samples.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="On_All_Frequenices">On All Frequenices</span></h3>
<p>The first official full length album by Subatomic Sound System, <i>On All Frequencies</i> covered a broad range of genres, tempos and timbres. <i>On All Frequencies</i> entered the CMJ radio Top 40 charts in both &#34;electronic&#34; and &#34;world&#34; (i.e. reggae) categories simultaneously during spring 2007.&#60;ref&#62;CMJ radio charts <a class="externallink" href="http://www.cmj.com/&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cmj.com/&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.cmj.com/&#60;/ref&#62;</a> The album received positive reactions across a broad spectrum of the electronic, hip hop and reggae press. It was described by <i><a href="" title="BPM (magazine)">BPM</a></i> magazine in its vital releases column as &#34;connecting the dots between dub reggae, dancehall, hip hop, drum &#38; bass, downtempo and broken beat&#34;.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.bpmmagazine.net/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.bpmmagazine.net/"><i>BPM</i> magazine Nov 2006/Dec 2006/Jan 2007</a>&#60;/ref&#62; It received a four afro rating from the popular website <a href="" title="Okayplayer">Okayplayer</a>, (their ratings system based on site founder and <a href="" title="The Roots">The Roots</a> drummer <a href="" title="Questlove">Questlove</a>&#39;s hairstyle), who opined, &#34;These beats could become the blueprint for future producers...Genius producing&#34;, a &#34;certified gunsmoke!&#34; review from OJ Lima, former <i><a href="" title="VIBE">VIBE</a></i> magazine editor and founder of DJ culture site, Limachips,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.limachips.com/&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.limachips.com/&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.limachips.com/&#60;/ref&#62;</a> and the reggae-centric <i>Beat</i> magazine wrote that the song &#34;&#39;Rize Up&#39; is a virtual revolutionary anthem&#34;.  The album was highlighted in <i><a href="" title="Beyond Race magazine">Beyond Race</a></i> magazine&#39;s 2007 Music Issue and Subatomic Sound System performed at the magazine release party in Brooklyn, New York. The Subatomic Sound System System song &#34;Breakin&#39; Down the Barriers&#34; inspired the magazine&#39;s editor to use the title as the name of the subsequent issue and it became a theme song for the magazine&#39;s mission.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/04/29/2008-04-29_beyond_race_magazine_breaks_down_barrier.html/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/04/29/2008-04-29_beyond_race_magazine_breaks_down_barrier.html/">&#39;Beyond Race&#39; magazine breaks down barriers</a>, NY Daily News&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
