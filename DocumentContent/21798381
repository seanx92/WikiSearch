<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b> per other sub-categories of <a href="" title="Category:Members of the European Parliament from the United Kingdom">Category:Members of the European Parliament from the United Kingdom</a>, which use the &#34;<i>for</i> Fooish constituencies&#34; format.</dd>
<dd>The place of birth of a politician should of course be categorised appropriately, but geographical categories of elected office-holders should reflect the place that elected them, not where they were born.  Otherwise we would have absurdities like categorising <a href="" title="Peter Hain">Peter Hain</a> as a &#34;South African MP&#34;, even though he has been politically active only in the UK and has been elected to the UK Parliament (not he S. African one).</dd>
<dd>The &#34;<i>for</i> Fooish constituencies&#34; format removes any ambiguity about whether the categories are intended to reflect the nationality of the MEPs or the constituency they represent, an ambiguity which has led to the removal of <a href="" title="Bairbre de Brún">Bairbre de Brún</a> MEP from the Northern Ireland category.  This is because she was born in Dublin, but was elected to the <a href="" title="European Parliament">European Parliament</a> for the <a href="" title="Northern Ireland (European Parliament constituency)">Northern Ireland constituency</a>.  She made her political career in Northern Ireland, and was twice elected to the <a href="" title="Northern Ireland Assembly">Northern Ireland Assembly</a> for <a href="" title="Belfast West (Assembly constituency)">Belfast West</a>, and renaming these categories to match <a href="" title="Category:Members of the European Parliament for English constituencies">Category:Members of the European Parliament for English constituencies</a> and  <a href="" title="Category:Members of the European Parliament for Welsh constituencies">Category:Members of the European Parliament for Welsh constituencies</a> will remove any ambiguity in her case and for any other MEP elected for a constituency outside the country of their birth. --<a href="" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#996600; cursor: not-allowed;&#34;&#62;Brown&#60;/span&#62;HairedGirl</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 23:46, 20 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<li>None of which are professionally specific. True. But a eugenicist, nihilist, satanist is not anywhere on the same league as a pacifist. You can argue that some nations, i.e. Arabic or Buddhist nations, have a greater reason to be vegetarian. Others have a greater reason to be pacifist (perhaps historically, Switzerland).  A nation can even be atheist - communist countries pretty much have to be. But, a eugenicist country? Even the sound of it makes no sense. WP:OCAT states that if there is no intrinsic connection between non-occupational cross-sections, they should not exist. Hence, this cat should not exist.

<dd>Other crap exists. Yes, I know. Sometimes things are divided by nationality when they become to unwieldy.

<dd>Bulldog, please pay closer attention to the long-standing wikipedia convention that a signature should include a link to your user page and/or talk page.  Without such a link, only way to tell which user you actually are is by taking the extra step of looking at the page&#39;s history. That&#39;s an unnecessary inconvenience to other editors. --<a href="" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#996600; cursor: not-allowed;&#34;&#62;Brown&#60;/span&#62;HairedGirl</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 21:39, 22 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>First, there is no such rule. You&#39;re right, it&#39;s just a convention. And it saves people from leaving me passive-aggressive messages. Secondly, I find it humorous that because I drop three numbers off the end of my sig, somehow everyone is miraculously unsure of my identity, even though there <i>is</i> no other user named Bulldog. &#60;span style=&#39;color: #900009;&#39;&#62;Bull&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#39;color: #FFA500;&#39;&#62;dog&#60;/span&#62;`
<dl>
<dd>Whether or not there is a formal rule, it is a common courtesy which helps editors interact.  The fact that you are explicitly keen to make it difficult for other editors to leave messages for you by including neither your actual username or a link makes me think that the disruptive is intentional. Your assumption that any messages left you will be &#34;passive-aggressive&#34; is a reamrkable display of bad faith. --<a href="" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#996600; cursor: not-allowed;&#34;&#62;Brown&#60;/span&#62;HairedGirl</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 01:08, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Oppose for now</b>, pending expert advice. It seems to me that the structure of the <a href="" title="Gaelic Athletic Association">Gaelic Athletic Association</a> in North America does not lend itself neatly to this form of category naming, because <a href="" title="The GAA in North America">The GAA in North America</a> includes three separate county boards: <a href="" title="North American GAA">North American GAA</a>, <a href="" title="Canada GAA">Canada GAA</a> and <a href="" title="New York GAA">New York GAA</a>.  I&#39;m no expert in this, but I will ask the good folks at <a href="" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Gaelic games">WikiProject Gaelic games</a> for their input. --<a href="" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#996600; cursor: not-allowed;&#34;&#62;Brown&#60;/span&#62;HairedGirl</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 21:59, 22 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>, Hmmm its a bit of a tricky one. You&#39;re right BHG, the main county boards in North America are <a href="" title="North American GAA">North American GAA</a>, <a href="" title="Canada GAA">Canada GAA</a> and <a href="" title="New York GAA">New York GAA</a> and I think the North American and Canadian county boards have &#34;sub&#34;-county boards after that. However I think all GAA clubs on wiki are categorised according to their location and not the county board they are affiliated to, e.g. we have <a href="" title="Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Dublin">Category:Gaelic Athletic Association clubs in County Dublin</a>, as opposed to <a href="" title="Category:Dublin Gaelic Athletic Association clubs">Category:Dublin Gaelic Athletic Association clubs</a>. Therefore I <i>think</i> the suggested rename is ok, unless somebody else can think of a reason to leave it as it is. <a href="" title="User:Derry Boi">Derry Boi</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Derry Boi">talk</a>) 22:21, 22 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Agree</b>.  I think that for the purpose of making the article accessible to people outside the GAA who aren&#39;t familiar with the somewhat confusing structures of the GAA in the states, I would agree with catagorising by country rather than county board.  There is a comprehensive listing of GAA clubs on a single page and that is broken down by county board anyway. --<a href="" title="User:Eamonnca1">Eamonnca1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Eamonnca1">talk</a>) 16:55, 23 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li><b>Creator&#39;s comments:</b>
<ul>
<li>The past: I made the overdue <a href="" title="Category:Journals by publication frequency">Category:Journals by publication frequency</a> hierarchy on the model of the <a href="" title="Category:Magazines by publication frequency">Category:Magazines by publication frequency</a> hierarchy. I named this &#34;Three times annually&#34; after <a href="" title="Category:Eight times annually magazines">Category:Eight times annually magazines</a> so as to be consistent, and assuming that a &#34;N times annually (journals/magazines)&#34; scheme would be more regular with &#34;Three&#34; included in it, rather than Triannual — even <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/triannual">wikt:triannual</a> recommends not to use the term. (Actually, I even wondered if I shouldn&#39;t avoid &#34;Biannual&#34; too and replace it with &#34;Two times annually&#34; or even &#34;Two times a year&#34;, but I didn&#39;t so as to stay consistent with the established <a href="" title="Category:Biannual magazines">Category:Biannual magazines</a>).</li>
<li>The future: I&#39;m not against changes, it&#39;s not a hot issue (pun intended), but I think the subcategories of <a href="" title="Category:Journals by publication frequency">Category:Journals by publication frequency</a> and <a href="" title="Category:Magazines by publication frequency">Category:Magazines by publication frequency</a> should be kept as consistent as possible, so it&#39;s not just about changing this one category but deciding about the naming scheme of two mirrored hierarchies and looking at the consequences:
<ul>
<li>a) <a href="" title="Category:Triannual journals">Category:Triannual journals</a> doesn&#39;t imply renaming another category, but it&#39;s recommended to avoid Triannual because of confusion with Triennal.</li>
<li>b) <a href="" title="Category:Journals with three issues a year">Category:Journals with three issues a year</a> diverges from all other categories that are &#34;FREQUENCY journals&#34; and would imply to rename all other subcategories such as <a href="" title="Category:Monthly journals">Category:Monthly journals</a> and <a href="" title="Category:Monthly magazines">Category:Monthly magazines</a>, etc. which is a lot of renames.</li>
<li>c) <a href="" title="Category:Three issues a year journals">Category:Three issues a year journals</a>  keeps the common &#34;(PERIOD) journal&#34; trailer and only imply to rename <a href="" title="Category:Eight times annually magazines">Category:Eight times annually magazines</a>, but it seems less commonly used than the next one, see below.</li>
<li>d) <a href="" title="Category:Three times a year journals">Category:Three times a year journals</a> keeps the common &#34;(PERIOD) journal&#34; trailer and only imply to rename <a href="" title="Category:Eight times annually magazines">Category:Eight times annually magazines</a> to <a href="" title="Category:Eight times a year magazines">Category:Eight times a year magazines</a>. Also, from a Google,<a class="externallink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22published+%2A+times+a+year%22" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22published+%2A+times+a+year%22"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22published+%2A+times+a+year%22" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22published+%2A+times+a+year%22">http://www.google.com/search?q=%22published+%2A+times+a+year%22</a></a> it seems by far the most common scheme.</li>
<li>e) <a href="" title="Category:Three times annually journals">Category:Three times annually journals</a> is the current one, it keeps more of the common &#34;(PERIOD-)y journal&#34; trailer and doesn&#39;t imply any rename at all. If the only reason to rename it was &#34;Triannual&#34; and we rule out &#34;Triannual&#34; then renaming isn&#39;t necessarily needed at all.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Obviously, I&#39;m in favor of (d) or (e).</b> Also, while at it, there are two issues about the current &#34;Biannual&#34; categories: (1) We have &#34;Bi-monthly&#34; vs. &#34;Biannual&#34;, and on Google the hyphenated &#34;Bi-annual&#34; seems more common. (2) We could avoid Biannual/Biennal with <a href="" title="Category:Two times a year journals">Category:Two times a year journals</a> (if &#34;d&#34;) or <a href="" title="Category:Two times annually journals">Category:Two times annually journals</a> (if &#34;e&#34;).

<dd>There is no name to rename &#34;Monthly journals&#34; etc., which are perfectly clear.

<li><b>Comment (nom)</b>.

<li><b>Comment</b> - Shouldn&#39;t the category name reflect the fact that it&#39;s for the CPL <i>system</i>?

<li><b>Comment</b> - do we have anything similar elsewhere? Why not just follow the standard formulation in <a href="" title="Category:Public libraries in Illinois">Category:Public libraries in Illinois</a>?  I would go for 1. &#34;Public libraries in Chicago, Illinois&#34; 2. <a href="" title="Category:Chicago Public Library system">Category:Chicago Public Library system</a>. &#39;Chicago Public Library&#39; sounds to me like a single library building (the article should perhaps have system tacked on, too.)  <a href="" title="User:Occuli">Occuli</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Occuli">talk</a>) 12:10, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>There is <a href="" title="Category:Minneapolis Public Library">Category:Minneapolis Public Library</a>. And also <a href="" title="Category:Chicago Public Schools">Category:Chicago Public Schools</a>. Neither uses &#34;system,&#34; though they could. The state category defines libraries from multiple governmental entities, but this one (and the Minneapolis category) defines just one. So I thought being specific made more sense. However, if I&#39;m alone in this belief, then I propose the obvious alternate <a href="" title="Category:Public libraries in Chicago, Illinois">Category:Public libraries in Chicago, Illinois</a>.--<a href="" title="User:Mike Selinker">Mike Selinker</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mike Selinker">talk</a>) 14:40, 20 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<li><b>Comment</b> - In my initial comment (above) I was going on the assumption that what you said was correct. But it seems to me that in the absence of <i>definitive confirmation</i> that there is not even a single other library in Chicago that can properly be described as &#34;public&#34;, we should play it safe and rename to <a href="" title="Category:Public libraries in Chicago, Illinois">Category:Public libraries in Chicago, Illinois</a>. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 22:07, 20 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>Doesn&#39;t &#34;public&#34; mean &#34;run by the city&#34;? I can say for certain that Chicago doesn&#39;t have two different municipal library systems, nor do any of the libraries in the category belong to any other system.--<a href="" title="User:Mike Selinker">Mike Selinker</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mike Selinker">talk</a>) 02:37, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>As I&#39;m sure you know, &#34;public&#34; <i>doesn&#39;t</i> mean &#34;run by the city&#34;, which would be &#34;municipal&#34;. The point is there could well be &#34;public libraries&#34; <i>located in</i> the city of Chicago, that aren&#39;t part of that city&#39;s public library system -- perhaps State of Illinois or Federal govt. libraries (or ???). That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s best to go with <a href="" title="Category:Public libraries in Chicago, Illinois">Category:Public libraries in Chicago, Illinois</a>. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 02:45, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>No, I&#39;m serious, I <i>don&#39;t</i> know that. I&#39;m not aware of state libraries in Illinois (there aren&#39;t any <a class="externallink" href="http://www.illinois.gov/government/agency.cfm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.illinois.gov/government/agency.cfm">here</a>) or federal libraries outside D.C. But regardless, <i>these</i> libraries are part of the CPL system, not any other. There is no danger of extant articles being miscategorized by this plan. But hey, it&#39;s just a suggestion.--<a href="" title="User:Mike Selinker">Mike Selinker</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mike Selinker">talk</a>) 03:21, 21 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There are various sorts of federal libraries (and depositories) outside of D.C., probably including Chicago, but practically speaking I suspect it&#39;s fairly unlikely that very many of them would have articles -- though, there&#39;s always the possibility of redirects to sections. When all is said and done, given your assurance that all of the existing articles pertain to the CPL system, I don&#39;t see any reason not to <b>rename <i>this</i> category to <a href="" title="Category:Chicago Public Library system">Category:Chicago Public Library system</a></b>, leaving open the possibility of creating <a href="" title="Category:Public libraries in Chicago, Illinois">Category:Public libraries in Chicago, Illinois</a> if &#38; when the need arises. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 21:01, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>Sure. I don&#39;t much like the &#34;system&#34; element, but whatever works.--<a href="" title="User:Mike Selinker">Mike Selinker</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mike Selinker">talk</a>) 23:54, 21 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. From the broadest perspective, the proposed rename would appear to be the safest. This would allow inclusion of the notable individuals who have been involved with the system.  If the concern is to have a category that is only for the libraries, then it probably should be renamed to <a href="" title="Category:Chicago Public Library libraries">Category:Chicago Public Library libraries</a>.  <a href="" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Vegaswikian">talk</a>) 22:58, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Rename</b> to <a href="" title="Category:Public libraries in Chicago, Illinois">Category:Public libraries in Chicago, Illinois</a> (1st choice) or <a href="" title="Category:Chicago Public Library system">Category:Chicago Public Library system</a> (2nd choice). I am not a fan of placing biographical articles into non-biographical categories, and that is why I am a little weary about changing from a list category (for articles about libraries) to a broader topic category (for articles related to the Chicago Public Library system). –<b><a href="" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a></b> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Black Falcon">Talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 23:31, 25 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>
