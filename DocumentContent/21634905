<dd>First, I suggest that you take the effort to add <b><i>&#34;istan(i)&#34;</i></b> to the (likely insulting) diminutive &#34;Pak&#34; if you wish to be taken seriously as desiring a neutral consideration of this problem. I would further suggest that you take this complaint to <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/Geopolitical ethnic and religious conflicts">Wikipedia:Administrators&#39; noticeboard/Geopolitical ethnic and religious conflicts</a> for review by sysops who are better able to disregard the nationalistic rhetoric of the differing parties.

<dd>Fair enough, but I would note that the diminitive &#34;Paki&#34; is considered an extremely pejorative insult in British society and, this being the English language Wikipedia, similar terms may strike the readership as antagonistic. Cultural sensitivities should work both ways. <a href="" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:LessHeard vanU">talk</a>) 17:57, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

<p>One dynamic to watch out for in admin discussions with multiple issues is that one hot button point dominates the discussion, and if that gets resolved as a nonissue the other outstanding issues may get overlooked.  This discussion has determined that &#39;Pak&#39; does not carry the derogatory connotations of &#39;Paki&#39;.  What it has not resolved is whether this person is edit warring.  And it may be arguable that block-worthy edit warring has been going on within the last few hours.

Posts were also made on the user pages.  The user has promised in edit summaries on numerous occasions that she or he will keep correcting the error she or he perceives until it is &#34;right.&#34;  In fact, it is from the pattern of edits, and the comments in the edit summaries (which say things like &#34;flies in the face of facts,&#34; &#34;get it right,&#34; &#34;wow! is wiki truth or fiction,&#34; and &#34;this is a lie&#34;), that it becomes apparent that all these edits are from the same user.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Threeafterthree">Threeafterthree</span></h2>

<p> 
What could be controversial in the following sentence from <a href="" title="Martin Fleischmann">Martin Fleischmann</a>? &#34;<i>He is best known for his controversial work with his colleague Stanley Pons on cold fusion using palladium in the 1980s and &#39;90s.</i>&#34; According to <a href="" title="User:Threeafterthree">User:Threeafterthree</a> it is the word &#34;best&#34;, which apparently is a clear violation of <a href="" title="WP:PEACOCK">WP:PEACOCK</a> and <a href="" title="WP:MOSBIO">WP:MOSBIO</a>. And of course it needs a source which says specifically that he is &#34;best&#34; known for it, otherwise the word must be removed or replaced with &#34;also&#34; (which, apparently, is perfectly fine here). </p>
<p>This has been going on since shortly after Guy expressed concern that Fleischmann might fall under <a href="" title="WP:BLP1E">WP:BLP1E</a> or <a href="" title="WP:COATRACK">WP:COATRACK</a> (for cold fusion). Note also that when the controversy started, the sentence following the incriminated one cited an article that included the phrase &#34;best known for his role in the &#39;cold fusion&#39; controversy&#34;. Oh, and Threeafterthree &#34;got give a rat&#39;s ass about this guy, but if folks want to write that FACT, then back it up&#34;. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMartin_Fleischmann&#38;diff=271437573&#38;oldid=271435149" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMartin_Fleischmann&#38;diff=271437573&#38;oldid=271435149"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMartin_Fleischmann&#38;diff=271437573&#38;oldid=271435149" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMartin_Fleischmann&#38;diff=271437573&#38;oldid=271435149">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMartin_Fleischmann&#38;diff=271437573&#38;oldid=271435149</a></a> By now the word &#34;best&#34; is sourced immediately in the place where it appears, and I seem to have satisfied Threeafterthree&#39;s concern <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMartin_Fleischmann&#38;diff=271577687&#38;oldid=271577214" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMartin_Fleischmann&#38;diff=271577687&#38;oldid=271577214"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMartin_Fleischmann&#38;diff=271577687&#38;oldid=271577214" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMartin_Fleischmann&#38;diff=271577687&#38;oldid=271577214">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AMartin_Fleischmann&#38;diff=271577687&#38;oldid=271577214</a></a> that I might have a COI or other agenda.

<p>It looks like he is once again longing for a wikibreak, as in November when he last edit-warred (on <a href="" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a>). <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThreeafterthree&#38;diff=251625951&#38;oldid=251621894" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThreeafterthree&#38;diff=251625951&#38;oldid=251621894"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThreeafterthree&#38;diff=251625951&#38;oldid=251621894" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThreeafterthree&#38;diff=251625951&#38;oldid=251621894">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AThreeafterthree&#38;diff=251625951&#38;oldid=251621894</a></a><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Threeafterthree&#38;oldid=251621894#Blocked" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Threeafterthree&#38;oldid=251621894#Blocked"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Threeafterthree&#38;oldid=251621894#Blocked" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Threeafterthree&#38;oldid=251621894#Blocked">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Threeafterthree&#38;oldid=251621894#Blocked</a></a>

<dd>The content issue should generally be ignored here and only behavior examined. Behaviorally, Threeafterthree was insisting on a content position and wikilawyering for it, insistently, repeatedly and sometimes uncivilly, plus asserting the position with edits when it was clear that no other editor supported him. (The position unsupported by others is that &#34;best known&#34; is inappropriate, and then a source is demanded for it, when there is a source and it&#39;s been asserted and shown. But, please, assume that Threeafterthree is correct on the content and focus on the behavior, i.e., insisting on correct content with repetitive edits, tendentious argument, and without any support from other editors.) .I&#39;ve been following this and have informally warned Threeafterthree on the article Talk page. If the behavior continues, I would warn him on his Talk, I felt that it was still short of that, though getting close. The behavior could warrant a Talk warning, and, if continued, a block. I can understand why Adler is concerned, though. Adler&#39;s behavior has not been spotless, he&#39;s been gratuitously uncivil, but also apologized for it, as I recall. --<a href="" title="User:Abd">Abd</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Abd">talk</a>) 21:10, 19 February 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The user should have been warned before bring this here. I recommend speedy close of this discussion as premature, unless someone has other serious behavior to report that took place after warning. This, and the notice on his talk page, could be considered the warning. On the other hand, I have not investigated this user&#39;s history, and if this is a repetition of prior patterns, with previous warnings and a block for such behavior, warning may not be necessary, I&#39;d take back my recommendation. --<a href="" title="User:Abd">Abd</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Abd">talk</a>) 21:20, 19 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<ul>
<li>Hans, I think Threeafterthree is a reasonable guy, you should try just talking to him, maybe even send email or something.  It&#39;s certain that we need to be careful saying that Fleischmann is best known for probably the largest and most spectacular cock-up of his entire career, so maybe an alternate form of words can be found. I had a go, see what you think. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User Talk:JzG">Guy</a>&#60;/b&#62; &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 21:38, 19 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>


<ul>
<li>I apologize that this has come to this board. There was a content dispute at a biography about using the term &#34;best known for&#34; and I pressed the issue I guess without knowing who all the players are, ect. or that cold fusion is touchy. Anyways, I really do not want to defend my prior history or feel a need to. I do remove comments from talk pages that I feel are harmful or off topic per <a href="" title="WP:FORUM">WP:FORUM</a>. Anyways, again, I think this has been overblown to reach this level but will listen to the community and try to work with the folks on the Martin Fleischmann talk page. Thank you, --<a href="" title="User:Threeafterthree">Tom</a> 22:46, 19 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>Hi, there is a content dispute at <a href="" title="Warren Buffett">Warren Buffett</a> regarding the addition of stock information, such as in <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Buffett&#38;diff=271986271&#38;oldid=271982208" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Buffett&#38;diff=271986271&#38;oldid=271982208">this diff</a>. I removed the content, but <a href="" title="User:Iifacts">User:Iifacts</a> added it back. We discussed the issue on <a href="" title="User talk:Iifacts">their talk page</a>, but it didn&#39;t go anywhere, so I am requesting for further input into the situation. Please see <a href="#Stock_Holdings" title="Talk:Warren_Buffett">Talk:Warren_Buffett</a> for the latest discussion, in which we are trying to form a consensus. The user reverted the same thing four times in the past 24 hours (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Buffett&#38;diff=271787419&#38;oldid=271767378" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Buffett&#38;diff=271787419&#38;oldid=271767378">1</a>, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Buffett&#38;diff=271979365&#38;oldid=271960064" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Buffett&#38;diff=271979365&#38;oldid=271960064">2</a>, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Buffett&#38;diff=271981931&#38;oldid=271980193" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Buffett&#38;diff=271981931&#38;oldid=271980193">3</a>, and <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Buffett&#38;diff=271986271&#38;oldid=271982208" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Warren_Buffett&#38;diff=271986271&#38;oldid=271982208">4</a>) but instead of going to <a href="" title="WP:3RR">WP:3RR</a>, I&#39;d rather just build a consensus on this as soon as possible so it can be done with.

<dd>Gary cut off many good content from the Warren Buffett page, especially the stock holding part and time line just because of his own taste. I try to engage talk with him but he dictated the page has to be in his way only, and reverted the page many times (4 times in 24 hours). Many people have done a lot of work and it&#39;s a shame that everything is gone and the page now looks very difficult to read.

<dd>I tend to feel the chart was too much smack in the middle of the article there, and I don&#39;t believe I&#39;ve ever seen someone&#39;s stock holdings in their article before.

<dd>I strongly think the stock holdings are important, what Gary did was that he cut off the stock holding info on Warren Buffett page and in the same time, change the stock holding data to his own, which was difficult to read and out-dated, with many data are plainly wrong (% of reported portfolio) on the Berkshire Hathaway page (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Berkshire_Hathaway" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Berkshire_Hathaway">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_assets_owned_by_Berkshire_Hathaway</a>). As an experienced editor, he intentionally violated the 3RR rule and tried to dictate everything.<a href="" title="User:Iifacts">Iifacts</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Iifacts">talk</a>) 04:41, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>(outdent) Guys and gals, what Administrative action are we looking for here, not that I am an admin, but I did stay at a Holiday Inn last night. This looks like a content dispute? Maybe try request for comment or ask some others to look at it which you did at the top of this section, but other than that? If parties are edit warring, take it to the 3RR board and I am sure some admin will be happy to block for a bit to help cool things down. Anyways, good luck. <a href="" title="User:Threeafterthree">Tom</a> 04:47, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p> 
Earlier i started a section about disruptive editor &#34;Eugene Krabs&#34;. Who i&#39;ve finally realized is a teenager, and therefore won&#39;t listen to me. He&#39;s been blocked 5 times already and i worry that he might get blocked for a 6th time. He modifies sections on his talk page to the way he likes it, he completeley deletes my comments, adds links to redirects that lead to the same page, threantens to block someone even though he&#39;s not an admin, and requests people to be blocked here, instead of <a href="" title="WP:AIV">WP:AIV</a>. And has so far developed 2 enemies in one day, while most users take months to get an enemy. And last but not least recreates pages that have made into a redirect. Like the section says, what will we do with Eugene? I tried being his mentor but he said no, and he obviously didn&#39;t learn from his past blocks. <a href="" title="User:Elbutler">Elbutler</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Elbutler">talk</a>) 12:21, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I take issue with the statement that &#34;he is a teenager and therefore won&#39;t listen&#34; to you. Also, saying he &#34;made 2 enemies in one day while most users make 1 enemy in several months&#34; doesn&#39;t make much sense. I can&#39;t take a report seriously that makes such false and generalizing assumptions. Also, since your views are so off the mark, I don&#39;t think you would make a good mentor anyway.--<a href="" title="User:Atlan">Atlan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Atlan">talk</a>) 13:04, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I agree that the statement is inappropriate: I&#39;m a bloody teenager, and I&#39;d like to think I can listen when people tell me action X is wrong (see my squeaky-clean block log, f&#39;rinstance). However the user in question obviously needs <i>something</i> done.

I got my Learner&#39;s Permit January 31st and my mom&#39;s been teaching me how to drive (and still is). I listen and everything. At first, I didn&#39;t listen as much, but was still careful. We also argue sometimes (not in the car) about things, which is normal. I think I&#39;d rather argue than go out and take drugs like some teenagers my age do, though. I&#39;ll talk more later, but right now I have to get ready to go to my high school. - <a href="" title="User:Eugene Krabs">Eugene Krabs</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Eugene Krabs">talk</a>) 15:26, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

The IP user has not engaged in any discussion on these topics, and simply reverts changes made by anyone who he disagrees with. These edits are clearly made by the same user: the content of the changes are nearly identical and the IP addresses are all highly similar, from Japan.</p>
<p>These edits stem from a content dispute, but the problem is not the disagreement over content, its the disruptive editing without an attempt for consensus building. The edits meet the standards of <a href="" title="WP:DE">disruptive editing</a>: they are tendentious, do not satisfy WP:verifiability, not interested in consensus, rejects community input, and if the user has engaged in any discussion through a username, then he is engaged in IP sockpuppetry.</p>
<p>I think the easiest way to solve this problem would be to simply protect the page from IP users, forcing this user to use his own username to make these disruptive edits.  </p>

<p>This issue was previously posted here as disruptive editing by JeffJor; CU check indicates JeffJor&#39;s IPs do not match these, so I am reposting it as a disruption by an IP user.  It remains just as disruptive.  Thank you in advance for the help.

<p>I cuddlyable3 am a relative newbie and now contribute mainly to mathematical articles. I am experiencing such mounting disruptions to editing from Greg_L that action is needed by an admin to enforce WP:POINT based on defiant incivility and <b>admitted</b> untruths by Greg_L.  This archived <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WQA#Incivility_by_Fnagaton_and_Greg_L" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WQA#Incivility_by_Fnagaton_and_Greg_L">WQA raised by Thunderbird2</a> is Closed as Stuck. That is because block sanctions that were discussed cannot be issued from WQA. I do not see that any of the editors who contributed in the WQA (excluding the two users implicated) condoned the behaviour of Greg_L. My involvement has been can be seen in the strikeouts of falsehoods that Greg_L introduced. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiquette_alerts&#38;diff=271104453&#38;oldid=271099145" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AWikiquette_alerts&#38;diff=271104453&#38;oldid=271099145">This summary</a> is my opinion of what needs to be done (by an admin).</p>

<dd>Well that leaves us in a bind as to a possible resolution, assuming we can&#39;t find some amicable (or otherwise) endpoint for this dispute.  Have we just tried separating the two parties?  Do they share too many common interests for this to be feasible?  Does either not wish to disengage from a particular subject?  More to the point, is Greg&#39;s behavior really all that bad?  From those diffs and links I don&#39;t see anything too bad.  Sure, he&#39;s being a jerk in that first post on his talk page about the WQA, but the next post is factual and direct.  The rest of the links are him removing material on his talk page (perfectly reasonable) or past AN/I reports.

When he pointed out a factual error in my rebuttal where I said he had deleted an animation, I apologized for that error publicly‚Äîin several places. He holds onto grievances and is here‚Äîagain‚Äîseeking his pound of flesh. All he needs to do is stop obsessing about Greg L and get on with editing. Problem solved. I don‚Äôt specialize in math-related articles and have zero interest involving myself with anything at all do do with Cuddly, except for when he leaves yet another post on my talk page announcing that he has found yet another forum to seek revenge.

If wikipedia is to be a creditable educational resource, you need to be more diplomatic in the deletion of information from the site.</p>
<p>Please inform me of how I can get the image back up on wikipedia as soon as possible. Thank You.</p>

<ul>
<li>I completely agree with Gnangarra. Born2cycle&#39;s only purpose for being on Wikipedia is to participate in naming disputes (he hasn&#39;t edited in the mainspace for over a fortnight). This naming dispute has now been going for 77 days, and it is Born2cycle who continues to sustain it, because such disputes sustain <i>him</i>. Every argument he has put forward has been responded to at length and in good faith, and numerous times, but nothing can dent his conviction that he alone bears The Truth. Everybody but Born2cycle is sick to death of this dispute, but Born2cycle will not let it go, continuing to badger us with the same long-refuted claims, insisting that the matter remains under dispute, and that further discussion is warranted, and that those who refuse to discuss it further are guillotining debate. 100% of editors who actually contribute in the field are against him, but he declares that a sign of bias, and fights on, forum shopping for &#34;unbiased&#34; participants, and seeking to deny a voice to the editors who actually have a stake in the decision. This has long since moved into the realms of arguing for the sake of arguing, or perhaps arguing for the sake of refusing to admit defeat. <a href="" title="User talk:Hesperian">Hesperian</a> 01:53, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>It is simply not true that my &#34;only purpose for being on Wikipedia is to participate in naming disputes&#34;.  That&#39;s ridiculous.  However, naming consistency within Wikipedia is a particular interest of mine (we all have our roles), and that interest causes me to get involved in many naming disputes.  Because of this interest, I watch and frequent WP:RM and the talk pages of several naming guidelines, and get involved when something piques me interest.  It just so happens that I&#39;ve never seen a guideline so out of line with the rest of Wikipedia as is the current flora guideline, and that&#39;s why I&#39;m particularly interested in it.  --<a href="" title="User:Born2cycle">Born2cycle</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Born2cycle">talk</a>) 22:16, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

Also, of course, Editor:Miguel.mateo&#39;s talk page. If, as he claims, more than 20 articles were effected by another editors POV regarding the validity of his edits, it certainly warrants the attention of a dispassionate and impartial Administrator (maybe more than one). The lack of common courtesy that was displayed, contrary to Wikipedia guidelines, is only one of the factors that is uncomfortable and frustrating. Some form of communication should have occured prior to such a widespread revert over a broad spectrum of articles. I have assisted Editor:Mateo by copy editing some of his Euro Coin articles and found him to always be a gentleman to the extreme...and I found his images to be an extreme benefit to the encyclopedia. It is transparent that he and his edits are being castigated by an obvious POV cabal because they feel ownership of &#34;their&#34; articles. Please look into this matter. Editor:Mateo edits deserve to be seen by our readers. He has gone thru the hurdles of copyright verification. --<a href="" title="User:Buster7">Buster7</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Buster7">talk</a>) 07:04, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks <a href="" title="User:Buster7">Buster7</a> for bringing this up to the admins. The basics of the recent fight:
<ol>
<li>There were a content dispute discussed in <a href="#Austrian_coin_issue:_Revert_fighting" title="Talk:Theater_am_K√§rntnertor">Talk:Theater_am_K√§rntnertor</a>, consensus was to keep the image and the text.</li>
<li>Not two days has pass and user <a href="" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> challenged exactly the same additions, this time in other article, proof here: <a href="#Non-free_coin_image" title="Talk:Maria_Callas">Talk:Maria_Callas</a>.</li>
<li>Immediately after user <a href="" title="User:DavidRF">DavidRF</a> started to removed all contributions from all articles, claiming that the use is illegal. Note that he removed the images and the text that comes with each image.  Apparently these two users team up to go against all contributions I have done, as can be seen here <a href="#Commemorative_coins_in_classical_music_articles" title="Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Composers">Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Composers</a>. Obviously revert fight started and since there were three users teaming against me I may have broken the 3RR more than once. I have asked them to stop severla times but they continued until recently.</li>
<li>Aparently they brought the topic the the use of the images is illegal here <a href="#Commemorative_coin_images" title="Wikipedia:Media_copyright_questions">Wikipedia:Media_copyright_questions</a>, thinking that they have a strong case to remove all my contributions; but they decided to start to remove texts and images even before this topic is concluded, which is not concluded yet.</li>
<li>Notice that neither of these two users had the decency of telling me what they were plannign to do in my talk page.  Instead a blant team up to remove all my contributions was made.  </li>
<li>I clearly asked to stop, I said that the legal ussage is clear and if by any reason is not as I think it is I will be removing the images myself.  I have asked to talk, to remove the image but leave the prose ... but nothing, the only thing I have got is blind removal of all my contributions even in articles that are not related to music at all.</li></ol></dd>
<dd>Basically this is nothing that these two users attacking my contributions just because they do not like what they add to &#34;their articles&#34;.  I have been very collaborative in the past, and more than once I have been asked to removed the image or the texts associated to the coin, in more than one article.  After the initial discussion, I have agreed in more than one article to not to include them based on the arguments of the discussion; but this time, no discussion, teaming up to blindly remove everything I have created. </dd>
<dd>I am not looking for a content dispute here, I just want the users <a href="" title="User:Kleinzach">Kleinzach</a> and <a href="" title="User:DavidRF">DavidRF</a> to recognize that what they did is not ethically correct.

<dd>Here upon request - looks like content dispute spanning multiple articles, and some copyvio claims.  I&#39;ll have to do some research, get some other work done, and will be glad to offer an opinion in a bit (if it hasn&#39;t been resolved by then).  Any particular diffs of note would be helpful. <a href="" title="User:Ched Davis">‚Äî Ched</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ched Davis">talk</a>) 14:24, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Thank you <a href="" title="User:Ched Davis">‚Äî Ched</a>.  It did start as content dispute, but quickly escalated to personal attacks against me and my contributions by the two editors mentioned.  I have already included the vast mayority of the conversations.  There were more conversations in all of our talk pages (some of them already removed by one of them).  I have no issues going the ethically correct way to reach an agreement of when can the images and/or the prose can be added, but teaming up to push me at the point to go to 3RR violation, and pushing the <a href="" title="WP:POV">WP:POV</a> that the images are illegal and that the content is SPAM is definitely not correct.  I have clearly asked them to stop and to talk, but instead they keep reverting my contributions even after I have explained several times. At the end one of them even went to an article that he has never touched before, just to remove my contribution too.  This is for me unacceptable. Apologies to you for the time you will spend looking into this issue. Thanks, <a href="" title="User:Miguel.mateo">Miguel.mateo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Miguel.mateo">talk</a>) 14:31, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Coin images are non-free and should not be added to any articles that are not directly about the coins themselves (e.g. the coin articles, or perhaps an article about the mint). Doing so is clear fair-use overuse, and edit-warring over it is likely to lead to a block. I have warned <a href="" title="User:Miguel.mateo">User:Miguel.mateo</a> to stop doing so. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Black Kite">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Black Kite&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/b&#62; 14:33, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Black Kite, when and where have you warned me? Also, &#34;should not be added to any articles that are not directly about the coins themselves&#34; is not true. Where it says so in the policy? Can you take a look at the classical sample in <a href="" title="Billy Ripken">Billy Ripken</a>, a copy right image of a baseball card is used in this article, but it does meet the fair use rationale. <a href="" title="User:Miguel.mateo">Miguel.mateo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Miguel.mateo">talk</a>) 14:38, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>On your talk page - have a look.  The relevant policy is <a href="" title="WP:NFCC">WP:NFCC</a> - please read it, especially <a href="#3a" title="WP:NFCC">WP:NFCC</a> (minimal use of non-free images) and <a href="#8" title="WP:NFCC">WP:NFCC</a> - significance.  Since a picture of a coin can never significantly increase the reader&#39;s understanding of the person or place depicted - it is merely a picture - they will always fail this policy.  If the images were in the article about the coin itself, then they are directly relevant and that is reasonable. The only exception might be if the person was deceased and the non-free image was the only image that could be used, or if the image itself was particularly notable - hence <a href="" title="Billy Ripken">Billy Ripken</a>.  In all the articles relevant here, there are free images available. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Black Kite">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Black Kite&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/b&#62; 14:42, 20 February 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have a long discussion with user ElCobolla about this topic, and I have the archives.  While we did not interpret &#34;understand&#34; similarly, it did give me a completely wide view of the copyright issues.
<ol>
<li><a href="#3a" title="WP:NFCC">WP:NFCC</a> does not apply, I added just one image in each article, that is minimum ussage. If you are trying to interpret this as &#34;in all of Wikipedia&#34;, then why do we need more than one fair use rationale?  <a href="#3a" title="WP:NFCC">WP:NFCC</a> is per article.</li>
<li><a href="#8" title="WP:NFCC">WP:NFCC</a>, please read it carefully. &#34;Non-free content is used only if its presence would significantly increase readers&#39; understanding of the topic&#34; the topic in thsi case are the coins being described, not the subject of the coins. Removing the image of the coin because it does not help to understand the subject is a wrong interpretation of the policy. Regardless, this is maybe the weakest point, and I do agree that in some cases the image can be removed by enhancing the prose of the coin. But this is exactly what the other two editors are against, they are against the fact of adding information of the coin on the articles of the subject of the coin.  Even if the article is a stub, they are against of adding such information.</li>
<li>Where in the policy this exception is explained?</li></ol></dd>
<dd>But again, I am not here to talk about the content dispute, is the way that lots of my contributions were removed, now by Black Kite too, without having a full understanding of the copyright issues, and without listening that in more than one occasion I have asked to leave the prose which is not illegal at all.  The proper way of doign this IMO is bringing this issue to a talk page and later decide the course of action. <a href="" title="User:Miguel.mateo">Miguel.mateo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Miguel.mateo">talk</a>) 15:02, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Why can&#39;t we talk about the content dispute?  You&#39;ve added these images to hundreds of pages.  We have to have a talk page discussion on each one for them to be removed?  Where was the talk page discussion when they were added in the first place?  You watch these pages like a hawk because you know people&#39;s first instinct upon seeing the images is to remove them.  It sounds like you are trying to create a barrier for removal so high that people just give up and let you keep the images on every page in wikipedia.  We have had monthly discussions where we re-hash the same points:

<dd>My worry is that you&#39;ll be back next month with another coin and you will completely forget we had this dispute, claim its personal (its only &#34;personal&#34; because you are the only editor spreading these images across non-coin articles) and we&#39;ll rehash the whole thing will happen again.  What is most frustrating, actually, is that you have <i>no interest whatsoever</i> in the quality of these articles other than they should contain a link and a picture to an uncirculated twenty-first century commemorative coin.  How is this constructive editing?  Can we get a ruling on this dispute once and for all so that we can return our energies to the actually content of the articles and not some tangential see-also, pop-culture link at the bottom of each article.  Thanks. <a href="" title="User:DavidRF">DavidRF</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DavidRF">talk</a>) 15:22, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

<li><i>I added just one image in each article, that is minimum ussage.</i>.  No.  Minimal use is zero, and non-free images should only be used where they pass all criteria in <a href="" title="WP:NFCC">WP:NFCC</a>.  The coin images do not do that, as I explained above. </li>
<li><i>the topic in this case are the coins being described, not the subject of the coins.</i>.  No.  If you add a picture of a coin to an article about a person, then the subject of the article is the person, not the coins. Hence why there is far more latitude in an article which is actually about the coins.</li>
<li><i>is the way that lots of my contributions were removed, now by Black Kite too, without having a full understanding of the copyright issues, and without listening that in more than one occasion I have asked to leave the prose which is not illegal at all.</i>.  The copyright issue is irrelevant; it is only the Wikipedia fair use policy which is important.  Also, the prose is fine to leave in, if it is important and relevant to the subject (you&#39;ll notice that I did so on one of the articles) but that&#39;s a content issue. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Black Kite">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Black Kite&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/b&#62; 16:12, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>The same issue takes place with <a href="" title="postage stamps">postage stamps</a> and there are several biographical articles where stamps are used and these need to go, but that&#39;s another story. Perhaps there is a need for <a href="#Images" title="WP:NFC">WP:NFC</a> to spell out more clearly than it does now that stamps and currency includes coins and that their use may only be in articles about the coin or stamp itself. IMHO, there should also be more clarity in <a href="#Images_2" title="WP::NFC">the exceptions listing</a> so editors can see more plainly what is allowed and what is. The current statements get twisted by editors who want to include non-free images where they are not permitted to their own advantage unless challenged like this coin-in-music-articles situation. <a href="" title="User:Ww2censor">ww2censor</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ww2censor">talk</a>) 16:23, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>‚ÜêI support a paragraph about the coin in the article (with WP:V/RS), and even a link to the article about the individual coin that describes the &#34;who, what, when, where, why and how&#34;, the coin was made.  My <b>very</b> limited knowledge of copyright and fair use policy, leads me to believe there may be a way to include the picture in that specific article.

<dd>Unindent...What a funny co-incidence. Check out todays op-ed section of the Chicago Sun Times: <i>&#34;The Opera is a place where people can get irked if you unwrap a stick of gum&#34;</i>. Neil Steinberg, Chgo Sun Times&#60; Feb 20,2009 (pg.18) That seems to sum up what is more at play here than any self-appointed protection of Wikipedia&#39;s legal status or a lawsuit over Editor:mateo&#39;s coin entries.</dd>
<dd>No one questions the protective nature of the Opera enthusists. It is a natural trait after working long and hard to create a quality article. But the same holds true for Editor:Mateo. He has also worked long and hard to facilitate good faith coin edits to a variety of articles that only add to the Wikipedia concept of the sum total of knowledge.</dd>
<dd>The claim that these edits do not comply w/ copyright violations or non-free policy, and that that is why his edits were deleted from <a href="" title="Maria Callas">Maria Callas</a> (for instance among dozens of others) is pure Baloney...Opera Style.</dd>
<dd>The request (or is it a demand?) for written permission is also a bit out of whack with what is possible. As a private citizen, Editor:Mateo has done all he could (and more) to contact representatives and officials of the various mints to guarantee that he has his ducks in a row. The hint that he is somehow under-handedly trying to edit to his own advantage is akin to putting handcuffs on the good guys. What should be happening is assisting each other in the endeavor to implement these minor additions to quality articles. Instead they are being treated as though they were graffitti on the Opera Halls front doors.--<a href="" title="User:Buster7">Buster7</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Buster7">talk</a>) 22:50, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>We are moving off topic, let&#39;s say for a second that you are all right about the images and this should not be included, which IMO, based on the current policy and license of the coins, is still questionable.  But let&#39;s assume you are all right and all those images need to go ... does that give right to DavidRF and Kleimzach to team out and remove <i>all images and all proses</i> even from articles that they have never participated before? How about all the proof that I have asked to clear the case first, I have asked why the prose ... their only answer was to continuing removing my contributions.  Can we focus on this please which is what I brought this topic for?  As I have said, I have no problems putting some good faith discussion in deciding what is good and what is not (DavidRF <b>just</b> started to develop a guideline for adding this type of information in music articles, I applause that!) but I can simply not believe that two good editors team up to fight against another &#34;no so good editor&#34; (that is me).  I can not believe that admins are not seeing what the problem is here, and they have taken their side already continuing removing contributions when this discussion is not finished.</p>
<p>And for the records, I have said several times already, the current policy DOES allow me to add those images in other articles not coin related.  If by any chance that changes, I will be the one writting the bot to remove all the images I have added all over wikipedia (we are talkign about 100&#39;s of those). <a href="" title="User:Miguel.mateo">Miguel.mateo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Miguel.mateo">talk</a>) 09:29, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Okay, the name was probably a bad choice. I have picked it because of the extreme amount of IP vandalism (almost all my reverts deal with obvious vandalism or unexplained deletions of sourced material).

<dd>My problem with you is that you just go around and revert articles without any prior discussion, especially in controversial topics that became a subject to a number of arbitration cases (<a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Armenia-Azerbaijan 2">Armenia-Azerbaijan 2</a>, for example). Here&#39;s an example: <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kirovabad_pogrom&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=272105831" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kirovabad_pogrom&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=272105831"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kirovabad_pogrom&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=272105831" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kirovabad_pogrom&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=272105831">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kirovabad_pogrom&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=272105831</a></a> If your account is a good faith one, I would appreciate if you discussed your reverts of edits of established users. And the choice of the name indeed is not a good one, it kind of does not suggest willingness to discuss potential problems. Of course, a user name is a matter of personal choice, and it is up to you which one to use. <a href="" title="User:Grandmaster">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Arial;color:#464646&#34;&#62;<b><i>Grand</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Grandmaster">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Arial;color:#808080&#34;&#62;<b><i>master</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> 12:58, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="IP_Edits_from_a_specific_range_growing_increasingly_disruptive_to_a_series_of_articles">IP Edits from a specific range growing increasingly disruptive to a series of articles</span></h2>

<p>Is there anything we can do about this situation:</p>
<p>An anon editor from the 87.217.6?.xxx range comes in every few days, and adds then re-adds unsourced or improperly understood from that source information to a growing range of articles, including <a href="" title="Trinidad and Tobago">Trinidad and Tobago</a>, <a href="" title="Aruba">Aruba</a>, <a href="" title="Caribbean Community">Caribbean Community</a> and <a href="" title="North American Free Trade Agreement">North American Free Trade Agreement</a>. They generally involve adding improper &#34;official language&#34; information to these articles.  Each edit series lasts from 6 to 11 separate edits long (rather than using preview) which means valid edits by other editors are often interspersed.  They sometimes have come back the same day to re-add their changes.</p>
<p>Can we semi-protect these articles, or otherwise deal with this range of IP addresses, or both?</p>
<p>(Yes, I know RFPP exists, but I wonder if there&#39;s something we need to do at the IP level).</p>

<p><a href="" title="User:J JMesserly">J JMesserly</a> is making a number of edits which are damaging the <a href="" title="microformat">microformats</a> emitted by Wikipedia, often making them emit broken and/ or bogus metadata (and is doing the same on Commons, but <a class="externallink" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump#Bogus_metadata" rel="nofollow" title="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Village_pump#Bogus_metadata">I&#39;ve raised the matter, separately, there</a>). I&#39;ve tried to reason with him on his and my talk pages, the microformat project page, various other projects, and many template- &#38; article talk pages. I&#39;ve offered to assist him (he&#39;s clearly new to microformats; I&#39;ve been implementing them here and elsewhere, and contributing to the designs of microformats and microformat parsers, since 2006). I&#39;ve got nowhere (I&#39;m sure he feels the same way about me). His behaviour includes repeatedly threatening me with Arbcom if I won&#39;t I submit to <i>binding</i> mediation, repeatedly asking the same questions, accusing me of vandalism (after having to apologise for doing so on Commons); making ad hominem attacks, edit warring without discussion (I&#39;ve also reverted often, but have always given reasons). I&#39;ve asked him to hold fire while we discuss matters, but he&#39;s continued; making so many edits to implement his preferred way of doing things that it looks like a bot run. I can see no evidence that he is interested in building or working towards consensus. I&#39;m tired of this (and currently ill); I really don&#39;t want to devote my time to compiling a catalogue of evidential diffs (most of my editing for the last week or two has been to argue these matters with him, to revert his damage and to point him at <a href="" title="WP:BRD">WP:BRD</a>, to the point where I&#39;m always fire-fighting instead of making more constructive edits); but some neutral party who understands metadata and especially microformats needs to look into this. <a href="" title="User:Pigsonthewing">Andy Mabbett</a> (User:Pigsonthewing); <a href="" title="User talk:Pigsonthewing">Andy&#39;s talk</a>; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Pigsonthewing">Andy&#39;s edits</a> 19:15, 19 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Andy Mabbett has an extensive history of making assertions about the correctness of his positions regarding microformats <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pigsonthewing_2/Evidence#The_infobox_war" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pigsonthewing_2/Evidence#The_infobox_war"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pigsonthewing_2/Evidence#The_infobox_war" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pigsonthewing_2/Evidence#The_infobox_war">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pigsonthewing_2/Evidence#The_infobox_war</a></a><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pigsonthewing_2/Evidence#Disruption_within_the_Sheffield_Wikiproject" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pigsonthewing_2/Evidence#Disruption_within_the_Sheffield_Wikiproject"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pigsonthewing_2/Evidence#Disruption_within_the_Sheffield_Wikiproject" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pigsonthewing_2/Evidence#Disruption_within_the_Sheffield_Wikiproject">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/Pigsonthewing_2/Evidence#Disruption_within_the_Sheffield_Wikiproject</a></a>[.  I was not aware of any of these prior events until recently, and I appear to be only the latest recipient of Mr. Mabbett&#39;s oversight of my contributions at Wikipedia.  While I maintain a positive outlook towards Andy, I am having a difficult time differentiating his past behavior from his current behavior.  Regardless, I have not responded to his frequent personal attacks and hope that memories of this friction will fade with time as we work together regarding our common passion for microformat capability at Wikipedia.  I have made repeated attempts at reaching common ground with Pigsonthewing.  Although he asserts authority regarding microformats, he quite often makes demonstrably incorrect statements (lamian war)<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive513#Reversion_of_large_numbers_of_my_edits_by_User:Pigsonthewing" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive513#Reversion_of_large_numbers_of_my_edits_by_User:Pigsonthewing"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive513#Reversion_of_large_numbers_of_my_edits_by_User:Pigsonthewing" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive513#Reversion_of_large_numbers_of_my_edits_by_User:Pigsonthewing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/IncidentArchive513#Reversion_of_large_numbers_of_my_edits_by_User:Pigsonthewing</a></a> (ISO date for JFK:November 22, 1963 (-07:00))<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Free_form_way_of_specifying_dates" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_(dates_and_numbers)#Free_form_way_of_specifying_dates"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Manual_of_Style_</a>(dates_and_numbers)#Free_form_way_of_specifying_dates</a> causing me to regard his frequent unsupported assertions with skepticism, and requests for support for his allegations.  These are declined, with the remark that he has already responded.  My proposal to him as that microformats.org community be the arbiters on the technical points he raises.

<dd>Actually what happened is that we noted your past history of complaints, every one of which turned out on investigation to be a case of you asserting something and other people not agreeing (and, yes, a goodly dose of ad-hominem argument from you as well). The admin noticeboards are for fixing obvious and/or pressing problems.  Since the problems you raise are often obvious only to you and disputed by others, and the damage also appears not to be evident to many others, then you are wasting your time keep coming here.

I have indefinitely blocked  . This user claims to be a ninth grade teacher at <a href="" title="Middletown High School North">Middletown High School North</a>. He registered a new account yesterday, and tried to hijack the school&#39;s article to <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Middletown_High_School_North&#38;diff=271990997&#38;oldid=269878990" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Middletown_High_School_North&#38;diff=271990997&#38;oldid=269878990">show an example</a> on why WP is not a good resource for term papers. I reverted them and left a templated warning.

I left a clearly-worded, untemplated warning on his talk page.

At this point I indef blocked him, and left a sharply-worded response on the article talk page. </p>
<p>I just wanted a sanity check. I felt an indef block was necessary, as not only did this user register an account for purposes other than building an encyclopedia, but that he essentially gave a tutorial for future vandals in his class. &#60;b&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;FF6600&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Caknuck">caknuck</a>&#60;/font&#62; &#60;sub&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Caknuck">¬∞</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/sub&#62; &#60;font color=&#34;FF6600&#34;&#62;is a silly pudding&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/b&#62; 19:47, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Why? He came to vandalize, behaved childishly, then chided the editor who undid the vandalism. Then he identified himself (maybe -- it&#39;s possible this is a hoax by one of his students).

<dd>Yes, but neither need we devote energy to preventing someone from himself immortalizing his bad judgment (cf., our creating an article to memorialize an <a href="" title="In real life">IRL</a> bad act, which is active, not passive).  The issue is, I know, a trivial one, and I can&#39;t imagine that anyone should quarrel with one&#39;s removing the guy&#39;s name (particularly because don&#39;t know whether the user was the person whom he purported to be or simply a student looking to have fun at a teacher&#39;s expense and because the putative disruption was innocuous), but I&#39;ve never understood why we are sometimes eager to assist those who would interfere with our enterprise; if someone of the age of majority who plainly acts in bad faith (by which term I would not characterize the user at bar) makes a public disclosure with which he is later uncomfortable, he is welcome to e-mail OTRS to seek removal, but I simply can&#39;t understand why one would seek to help proactively (unless, I guess, out of fealty to some provincial moral scheme to which none of our number, I hope and trust, clings).  <a href="" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 22:05, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="DrKiernan_moving_articles_against_consensus">DrKiernan moving articles against consensus</span></h2>

<p>This is yet another case that makes me feel that we should have a process, perhaps similar to <a href="" title="WP:DRV">WP:DRV</a>, for reviewing inappropriate closures of <a href="" title="WP:RM">requested moves</a>. Admin   closed the following requested moves clearly against consensus, for which I would appreciate feedback:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="" title="Mahilyow">Mahilyow</a> to <a href="" title="Mogilev">Mogilev</a>: DrKiernan closes the discussion <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mogilev&#38;diff=271310262&#38;oldid=271310068" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mogilev&#38;diff=271310262&#38;oldid=271310068">using his own arguments and research</a>, disregarding participants who provided a different feedback. If he had a personal position, he should have participated in the discussion and excused himself from closing it. The result was a move war with one one of the participants, which led to move protection. After complaints, DrKiernan reopened this discussion.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><a href="" title="Marko ƒêokoviƒá">Marko ƒêokoviƒá</a> to <a href="" title="Marko Djokovic">Marko Djokovic</a>: <a href="#Requested_move" title="Talk:Marko_ƒêokoviƒá">Disregarding the arguments provided by half of the participants</a>, DrKiernan goes ahead and moves this article to its diacritic-less version (making it one of the few exceptions amongst thousands of articles on Wikipedia where we use diacritics for articles on people whose names do contain diacritics in their original language). According to DrKiernan&#39;s closing rationale, the &#34;opposers did not provide evidence&#34;. I <a href="#Move_proposal_at_Talk:Marko_.C4.90okovi.C4.87" title="User_talk:DrKiernan">explained on his talk page</a> that this is false, but DrKiernan rebuffs and claims that the source provided is &#34;dubious&#34;, and doesn&#39;t comment on the fact that usage of diacritics on Wikipedia is not affected by the predominance of sources that prefer not to use them. This discussion has not been reopened, nor its resulting move reverted yet.</li></ul>


<dl>
<dd>From these cases, it appears to me that DrKiernan seems to be unaware that, just like other poll-like discussions, personal opinions don&#39;t bid well upon closing requested moves, especially if they are used to enforce what&#39;s against consensus (or lack of). A review of these cases could prove most useful. &#60;strong&#62;&#60;font style=&#34;color: #082567&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Husond">H√∫s</a>&#60;/font&#62;<a href="" title="User:Husond/Esperanza">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;√∂&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;font style=&#34;color: #082567&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Husond">nd</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/strong&#62; 20:00, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Agree as well. I do not see any concerns here. Consensus is always evaluating strengths of arguments, not numbers and if he repeats one argument in his closing statement, even with a new source, it&#39;s still not a personal bias. The first example has also, unrelated, an ugly case of wheel-warring as one of the admins ( ) involved in the discussion reverted the move.<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;page=Mogilev" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;page=Mogilev"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;page=Mogilev" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;page=Mogilev">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log&#38;page=Mogilev</a></a> <b><a href="" title="User:SoWhy">&#60;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps; color: #AC0000&#34;&#62;So&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:SoWhy">&#60;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps; color: #1F3F53&#34;&#62;Why&#60;/span&#62;</a></b> 21:56, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>
<ul>
<li>I was supposed to be either worried or surprised by this kind of feedback, but I&#39;m frankly not. Your message in the end is that next time, instead of wasting my time participating in move discussions, I&#39;ll just close them according to the so-called &#34;strength of arguments&#34; and naming convention guidelines that do not exist. After all, there seems to be a clear consensus here for such kind of closures. Which I must say is sadly in line with Wikipedia&#39;s growing tendency to move decision making away from the community, and closer to the bureaucracy we were never supposed to be. &#60;strong&#62;&#60;font style=&#34;color: #082567&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Husond">H√∫s</a>&#60;/font&#62;<a href="" title="User:Husond/Esperanza">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;√∂&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;font style=&#34;color: #082567&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Husond">nd</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/strong&#62; 23:18, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Well, you are an admin, you should be able to close discussions based on strength of arguments - that is what judging consensus is about. I don&#39;t see your problem that an admin, who has not expressed any opinion about the matter, did just that and I see no change in consensus about that. <b><a href="" title="User:SoWhy">&#60;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps; color: #AC0000&#34;&#62;So&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:SoWhy">&#60;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps; color: #1F3F53&#34;&#62;Why&#60;/span&#62;</a></b> 19:28, 21 February 2009 (UTC)  </li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Incredible.</p>
<p><a href="" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a> clearly specifies that the admin&#39;s job is to <i>gauge consensus</i>: ‚Äú<i>If there is a clear consensus after this time,</i> the request will be closed and acted upon. <i>If not,</i> the administrator may choose to re-list the request to allow time for consensus to develop, or close it as &#34;no consensus&#34;.‚Äù  DrKiernan wilfully ignored the lack of consensus (he stated ‚Äúthe vote is evenly split‚Äù, but that was false), and made his own decision about the content.  I started the ‚Äúugly wheel war‚Äù because I honestly thought from <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mogilev&#38;diff=271310262&#38;oldid=271310068" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Mogilev&#38;diff=271310262&#38;oldid=271310068">his comment about the content</a> that he was a participant who decided to unilaterally move the article‚ÄîI  knew that the majority was against the move, and so I was quite surprised to learn that he considered himself to be closing the request in good faith.  </p>
<p>So ‚Äú<a href="#Reasonable_consensus-building" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">Consensus develops from agreement of the parties involved</a>‚Äù is now out the window?  Why bother with move discussions at all?  Just pick your favourite ‚Äúclosing admin‚Äù and present your opinion to him.  Screw the majority, he&#39;ll you just have to convince a single judge and jury.  If someone protests, then he&#39;ll wash his hands of it by ‚Äúrelisting‚Äù the article improperly for a few hours until someone else cleans it up, as Dr Kiernan did.</p>
<p>If this is how it works, then there should be a clear explanation at WP:RM of what editors are to expect.  What I see is one thing at WP:RM, and completely contrary behaviour being rewarded.  This looks like a big crock to me.  From now on I&#39;ll stick to making my own consensus by closing move requests, rather than participating in them.&#38;nbsp;<i>‚Äî<a href="" title="User:Mzajac">Michael</a>&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Mzajac">Z.</a>&#38;nbsp;&#60;small&#62;2009-02-21&#38;nbsp;00:58&#38;nbsp;z&#60;/small&#62;</i></p>

<dd>Consenus is not about counting votes, and admins may weigh votes based upon the strength of their arguements especially, <i>vis-a-vis</i> established policies and/or guidelines.  It is not enough for a whole bunch of people to simply vote; the admin may choose to disregard or weight votes less where such votes do not indicate a compelling rationale or do not cite established policies and/or guidelines.  Policies and guidelines are <i>established by consensus</i>, so votes which cite relevent policies and guidelines tend to have more weight than those that do not.  I see no evidence here that DrKiernan acted inappropriately in this matter.  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;contribs&#60;/small&#62;</a> 03:46, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>There&#39;s a very big difference between all that and closing a discussion based on your own arguments and views. Again you mention policies and guidelines that have neither been met nor transgressed by arguments presented at the discussion. I find it hard to understand why is it being so difficult to see that these discussions are simple cases when an admin drops by, sides with one of the parties, and closes against the natural outcome. In fact, for the Mogilev discussion, I could&#39;ve closed it myself when I joined in. In fact, it was already on the backlog at <a href="" title="WP:RM">WP:RM</a>, and there was no consensus to move. But because I had an opinion, I presented it instead of closing, something that DrKiernan should have done as well. Next time, I&#39;ll just close, because it is obvious that ANI won&#39;t really care if the closing admin acted unilaterally as long as he provided arguments for going against consensus. It&#39;s insane and makes me agree more with Haukur who used to say that we should start having votes and not discussions, because there is no point in having a discussion if one single person is going to decide for everybody. &#60;strong&#62;&#60;font style=&#34;color: #082567&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Husond">H√∫s</a>&#60;/font&#62;<a href="" title="User:Husond/Esperanza">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;√∂&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;font style=&#34;color: #082567&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Husond">nd</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/strong&#62; 12:31, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Advice_required">Advice required</span></h2>

<p>I&#39;m more of an on-off editor to Wikipedia and usually whenever I return to Wikipedia, I adopt a new username (weirdly, it gives a new motivation to start afresh) and I link these usernames too. My edits done under the usernames <a href="" title="User:RajatKansal">User:RajatKansal</a>, <a href="" title="User:Lokanth">User:Lokanth</a>, <a href="" title="User:AI009">User:AI009</a>, <a href="" title="User:Emperor Genius">User:Emperor Genius</a> and <a href="" title="User:Enigma Blues">User:Enigma Blues</a> stand proof that I have mostly done edits under these usernames in different time-frames and linked them whenever a newer one was created. And never have I used multiple accounts to add weight to my viewpoint or edits. Couple of months back, I started making edits only under an ip, which was shared account. Anyways, I ran into a dispute while making edits under that ip with <a href="" title="User:Lalit Jagannath">User:Lalit Jagannath</a>. I raised the issue with some other Wikipedians who advised me to seek Request for Comment. So I created <a href="" title="User:Enigma Machine">another account</a> (I know, I love creating new accounts) and linked my previous ip with that new account and started a RfC. Obviously, and rightly so, others thought that I was a sock and blocked me. I was blocked before I could link it to my other accounts. However, I never used my previous accounts to back my case. Nonetheless, I realized my mistake and served my block term. I also realized that to make your voice heard in Wikipedia, it is very important to stick to one account so that your reputation is gradually built and your name is not associated with some other unknown blokes (in this case, <a href="" title="User:Signswork">User:Signswork</a>).</p>
<p>Anyways, fact remains, and as I have mentioned before, I have never used two or more accounts to back my case. I can probably recall one small instance on <a href="" title="Talk:Delhi">Talk:Delhi</a> but that was short-lived and totally unrelated to this dispute. As far as this dispute with User:Lalit Jagannath is concerned, the problem arises because of this user&#39;s massive, biased and sometimes unsourced edits to India-related articles which are made without being discussed. Concerns about his edits have been raised by several users and this is evident by going through his talkpage.</p>
<p>For those who might be interested, seems that User:Lalit has got excessive time to kill. So, he devoted a <a href="" title="User:Lalit Jagannath/Indicious">nice little page</a> to me. I didn&#39;t link my blocked account (User:Enigma Machine) to my current one for obvious reasons. Regarding me and my multiple accounts, if fellow Wikipedians think that this does not abide by Wikipedia rules and was unethical, I&#39;m willing to quit Wikipedia for good. I can&#39;t assure that I won&#39;t return in future since my love for this project is too great, but yes, it would be a lesson hard learned. --<a href="" title="User:Incidious">Incidious</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Incidious">talk</a>) 18:48, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>Please look at <a href="" title="Talk:Humanism">Talk:Humanism</a> and recent edits to the article itself by <a href="" title="User:Wilson Delgado">User:Wilson Delgado</a>. A few of us seem to be having difficulty with getting  him to respect consensus established on the talk page; when he attempted to establish consensus in favor of his own opinion, it was roundly rejected (see <a href="#Requested_move" title="Talk:Humanism">Talk:Humanism</a>). His opinion is based on one of five definitions for &#34;humanism&#34; listed in the unabridged OED, that is not listed in the abridged version of the OED, and has been demonstrated to be a tiny minority viewpoint in modern use of the term. Consequently, he falls afoul of the <a href="" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a> policy, but will not accept this position and insists on revert-warring to get his own way (see <a href="#3RR_Warning" title="User_talk:Wilson_Delgado">User_talk:Wilson_Delgado</a>). His edits to bring greater prominence to his own viewpoint are agenda-driven, vague, unencyclopedic, and do not cite verifiable sources, as in the following examples:</p>

<ul>

<p>Two editors have posted over 60 examples of common, modern usage, gleaned in verifiable ways, and Wilson Delgado has attempted to refute (unsuccessfully, in my opinion) perhaps only two or three of them. Furthermore, his own citations to support his minority viewpoint‚Äîthe OED, which he admitted <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Humanism&#38;diff=270911588&#38;oldid=270903605" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Humanism&#38;diff=270911588&#38;oldid=270903605">here</a> does not quantify frequency of use, and the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, which he actually quoted as disagreeing with his tiny-minority viewpoint, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Humanism&#38;diff=271403624&#38;oldid=271401225" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Humanism&#38;diff=271403624&#38;oldid=271401225">here</a>!‚Äîdo not address the issue of contention, but he won&#39;t cite any additional sources.</p>
<p>His behavior reeks of <a href="" title="WP:ABF">bad faith</a>, and I&#39;m concerned that he is an agenda-driven editor with no respect for Wikipedia policies and in fact, a lot of disdain for Wikipedia itself, as evidenced by <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Humanism&#38;diff=270911588&#38;oldid=270903605" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Humanism&#38;diff=270911588&#38;oldid=270903605">this quote</a>:</p>
<p>&#60;blockquote&#62;<i>Dictionaries do not quantify frequency of use, as that is a Sisyphean task, but they have to make general estimates of relevant usage. So I think it would be better just to go to the gold-standard dictionaries, like the OED (unabridged), and see what they do not mark as archaic, rare, or obsolete, for a general sense of the active range of meanings. That is their job and it is futile to try to reproduce in an amateurish way what they dedicate many professional hours to doing.</i>&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>

<p>Just putting this here for reference: I&#39;ve apparently inspired a &#34;small child&#34; to want to kill herself. (Background: I found an edit on an <a href="" title="User talk:24.170.90.146">IP talkpage</a> from <a href="" title="User:Mayme08">an editor</a> with whom I&#39;ve had much trouble, mainly in the &#34;competence is required&#34; vein, and warned her for the edit. The IP then showed up on my talk page disputing something I&#39;d said...and signed as the name user. I blocked the IP for 6 months, the name account indefinitely, and explained on both talkpages why that was so. <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMayme08&#38;diff=272366468&#38;oldid=272298962" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMayme08&#38;diff=272366468&#38;oldid=272298962">This</a> is the reply.) If ever I was inclined to ignore such a threat, now would be that time--reading this user&#39;s contribution history and talk-page comments, there is no earthly reason this individual should be editing here. (She says she&#39;s a kid, but also says she&#39;s the IP&#39;s &#34;boss at work&#34;. My utter lack of patience and credulity--let me show you it.)

<p>My purpose for wanting this picture to be included is that i know people don&#39;t usually read every word on a Wiki page, we usually skim the page.  I am adding this picture for those people who want a fair, informational story but want it fast, without having to read each word.  There are probably good paying jobs for those who want to create an ad for foie gras, but this is not the place.

<p>This is a pure content dispute with no admin action really needed, and consensus here and at <a href="#Images" title="Talk:Foie_gras">Talk:Foie_gras</a> seems to agree that the image is what it claims to be (a duck being tube-fed to make fois gras) so there&#39;s nothing for an admin to here. &#60;font color=&#34;0D670D&#34; face=&#34;Georgia, Helvetica&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Rootology">rootology</a>&#60;/font&#62; (&#60;font color=&#34;#156917&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Rootology">C</a>&#60;/font&#62;)(&#60;font color=&#34;#156917&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Rootology">T</a>&#60;/font&#62;) 20:32, 19 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It&#39;s to try to &#34;prove&#34; that it&#39;s cruelty to animals. A photo provides better shock effect than simply talking about it. Meanwhile, the guy who originally raised this issue, and claimed Sko1221 is a sock, has stayed away from this for the time being. It&#39;s more his battle than mine, as I don&#39;t like POV-pushing, nor do I like liver. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 20:39, 19 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Hi, Sarah here, SKO1221.  I have not stayed away, i am not a &#34;sock&#34;, i simply forgot to log in so did not show up as SKO.  </p>

<dl>
<dd>Never been to either article, just saw this in passing.  I would tend to think that an article on <a href="" title="Foie gras">Foie gras</a> should concentrate on only the subject matter itself, and not the controversy.  That is why there appears to be this separate <a href="" title="Foie gras controversy">Foie gras controversy</a> to cover the issue of why people are against this product, rather than the product itself.  The <a href="" title="Fur clothing">Fur clothing</a> article does not contain images of bloody animal pelts, for example. <a href="" title="User:Tarc">Tarc</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Tarc">talk</a>) 20:37, 19 February 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>But the article already has a section on fattening. The image is hardly comparable to bloody animal pelts, it is merely an image of a duck being fattened up to illustrate that section of the article. <a href="" title="User:Theresa knott">Theresa Knott</a> | <a href="" title="User talk:Theresa knott">token threats</a> 20:55, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>And it has arguably a POV-fork that focuses on the controversy, which is where the picture came from.

<dd>And also, before you get upset and think that we are attempting to enforce some ridiculous standard for verifiability, please understand that we do so because claims made without evidence are rarely done so for face value.  &#34;We&#34;, that is, the pseudonymous and anonymous contributors to wikipedia, have <i>no</i> idea what constitutes &#34;white&#34; in argentina, what &#34;all-white&#34; connotes there or what importance the label carries.  Even in the US, white has meant different things to different folks over the years.  I could argue that &#34;white&#34; means only anglos or only anlgo-saxons (excluding southern europeans and people on the iberian penninsula).  Parsing that terms is a testy business for people who have some qualifications, and &#34;we&#34; (again, those editors to wikipedia) have none.  Apart from that is the problem of <a href="" title="WP:UNDUE">due weight</a>.  Why is it important that an encyclopedia note that these girls are or appear to be &#34;white&#34; (assuming we can settle on a definition)?  Why is it important enough to note in the article and yet not important enough for a single reliable source to mention?  What are we insinuating to our readers about the basketball team?  the problems are myriad.  The solution is simple.  Just find a source or remove the description.  And as Tony says above, this isn&#39;t an issue for admin intervention. <a href="" title="User:Protonk">Protonk</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Protonk">talk</a>) 04:37, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>At least a couple of them look Hispanic to my eye, which indicates that calling them &#34;white&#34; is original research or personal interpretation. The picture&#39;s description doesn&#39;t say they&#39;re white kids, it says they are kids in a Celtic dancing class. That description seems to square with the photo, so it would be reasonable to use the photo in an article about Celtic dancing. Asserting that they are &#34;white&#34; is inappropriate not just because of the subjective nature of drawing conclusions from a photo, but also because &#34;white&#34; is a colloquial term lacking a strict definition. In fact, if &#34;white&#34; is taken to mean &#34;caucasian&#34;, then <i>everyone in Argentina</i> is &#34;white&#34;, except for those whose ancestors are aboriginal peoples or who intermarried with aboriginal peoples. In short, lacking further evidence, the picture shouldn&#39;t be used as an illustration of &#34;White Latin Americans&#34;. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 07:00, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Blogging4truth_SSP">Blogging4truth SSP</span></h2>

<p>Please see <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Blogging4truth/Archive">Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Blogging4truth/Archive</a> for the details. It&#39;s a mixture of BLP vios, trolling, spamming and socking so I am posting here. The case just closed as it seemed that no one could agree on how to proceed or what was necessary, but there is a distinct pattern to the edits and an obvious intent to self promote and inflame. The final recoemmendation was to bring it up here. It seemed clear to everyone who commented in the case and outside of it that the sockpuppets are clearly him and that the contributions were all both predictable and highly undesirable. There have been no edits since the SSP case was opened but there has never been any discussion from the editor(s) and from the wide range of articles edited in the past it will not be obvious where he will appear next without following his blog to see what the next topic is. There is a WPSPAM case on michaelcrook.net too. <a href="" title="User:Mfield">Mfield</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mfield">talk</a>) 03:50, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

Speaking of that, why is the <a href="" title="Michael Crook">Michael Crook</a> article salted?

<dd>Shouldn&#39;t be necessary to CU, these are all blindingly obvious - his MO is to cite himself, link his name and add links to his blog or other blogs quoting him.  Our old friend the <a href="" title="WP:DUCK">Canard Abuse Detector</a> is probably adequate to the task for now.  The consensus at the last deletion debate was that any notability (or more accuratley notoriety) was passed; the rate of comment on him was low and appears to me to be tailing off. Michael Moore he ain&#39;t.  &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User Talk:JzG">Guy</a>&#60;/b&#62; &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 10:23, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>So then we assume it&#39;s all sockpuppeting by the person in question?  The !vote was 9-7 in favor of deletion (7-5 if one discounts the contributions the closing administrator stated as discounted) but the entire process was problematic - canvassing, sockpuppetry, manipulation, and it would be hard to say that the decision was made on grounds of notability.  Notability doesn&#39;t diminish over time - either the subject is notable or he is not.  He does formally meet WP:BIO - full articles / segments devoted to him over a span of years on a variety of subjects on CNN, Fox News, and some less significant publications.  Most of that coverage came <i>after</i> the AfD, so it is not controlling.  There&#39;s no policy reason why the article cannot be recreated.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Disruptive_editors_at_the_Barack_Obama_page">Disruptive editors at the <a href="" title="Barack Obama">Barack Obama</a> page</span></h2>

<p> </p>
<p>The following editors are going around starting trouble for anyone writing anything the slightest bit outside their tastes on the Obama page and causing general chaos on the talk pages. <a href="" title="ACORN">ACORN</a> is a big story concerning Obama as he personally worked there as a principle and this story was carried by all the networks in prime time repeatedly. Anything I or anyone else writes on the story is either deleted with blocks on the writer, done immediately within moments without warnings or archived if consensus is seen to be had. The discussions there have been turned into a rat&#39;s nest due to these continuous disruptions. </p>
<p>Further user &#34;<a href="" title="User:Brothejr">User:Brothejr</a>&#34; seems to pop out of nowhere, threatening me and others with messages that never end up at my userpage or anywhere to dif. I have missed key discussions with other editors on sourcing because they deleted pertinent discussion on this in moments of it being put up and this has warded off other editors trying to work with me. I have to dig into deleted scrambled mess to to see what they are talking about, it&#39;s very annoying. They wrongly interfering with proper editing and some are using profanity such as user <a href="" title="User:Sceptre">User:Sceptre</a> in the Voter Fraud section (which should have &#34;ACORN&#34; in the title but this is guarded and immediately deleted). It is presently effectively blocked by &#34;archiving&#34; in talk which is ridiculous and I don&#39;t know how to dif an archive attack but it is there under &#34;Allegations of Voter Fraud&#34;.</p>
<p>The ACORN case is not a &#34;fringy&#34; issue but front and center in Obama&#39;s personal, direct election activities now being investigated by the FBI and current. Attacking of anyone and threatening editors talking about it with &#34;this is your only warnings&#34; threats is highly disruptive. One editor working with me: <a href="" title="User:Die4Dixie">User:Die4Dixie</a> has &#34;retired&#34; from Wikipedia due to all this. Other editors finally went into a rage and were blocked, such as user <a href="" title="User:Ratttso">User:Ratttso</a>. I request that these editors set forth below be blocked so I can edit in peace if they cannot stop their disruptive actions and edit in good faith and they appear not to be stopping this major disruptive activity no matter what <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barack_Obama&#38;diff=272216909&#38;oldid=272211233" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barack_Obama&#38;diff=272216909&#38;oldid=272211233"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barack_Obama&#38;diff=272216909&#38;oldid=272211233" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barack_Obama&#38;diff=272216909&#38;oldid=272211233">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barack_Obama&#38;diff=272216909&#38;oldid=272211233</a></a><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barack_Obama&#38;diff=272216909&#38;oldid=272171787" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barack_Obama&#38;diff=272216909&#38;oldid=272171787"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barack_Obama&#38;diff=272216909&#38;oldid=272171787" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barack_Obama&#38;diff=272216909&#38;oldid=272171787">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk:Barack_Obama&#38;diff=272216909&#38;oldid=272171787</a></a> </p>

<li>Bugs, maybe you can take a minute to enlighten me as to what this is about?  It&#39;s OT here so on my talk page maybe.  Are the cons claiming that Obama&#39;s election was nearly as fraudulent as Dubya&#39;s first?

<li>ACORN is an organization that was active in recruiting new voters. A lot of them apparently voted Democratic, as previously disenfranchised voters often do, and some Republican supporters are trying to... well, I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re trying to do. They&#39;re not going to overturn the election. So basically they&#39;re just trying smear Obama with what is essentially now a dead news story. And as you say, where were they in 2000 and 2004, when the shoe was on the other foot? Pushing for Bush&#39;s election and re-election, of course. So these guys are just using wikipedia as a partisan playground, trying to get away with as much POV-pushing as they can. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 11:28, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="More_disruption_at_Wikipedia_flora">More disruption at Wikipedia flora</span></h2>

<p>Two editors disagree both with the naming policy and with each other.  They have been disrupting Wikipedia flora editing for over three months now.  </p>
<p><a href="" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">User:Philip Baird Shearer</a> has been tagging the policy as &#34;disputed&#34; based on his unique interpretation of Wikipedia naming policies.<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=4" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=4"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=4" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=4">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=4</a></a>  He has been asked repeatedly to stop disrupting Wikipedia.  He is not discussing the issue with other editors.  Instead he is repeating the same points that other editors have refuted on numerous occasions, but he will allow no arguments against his pointed and disruptive unsupported declaration that Wikipedia flora naming conventions are in violation of the naming convention guidelines that refer editors to Wikipedia flora naming conventions for guidelines on naming flora articles.<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=5" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=5"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=5" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=5">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=5</a></a>  </p>
<p>His arguments may make sense to him, and this appears to be the case, that he believes he is making a supportable argument, that the general guidelines that mention using the specific guideline are being violated when you use the specific guideline that general guidelines refer the user to.  However, it is not possible to discuss an issue when what a user is drawing inferences that are not supported by what he claims.</p>
<p>He continues to revert and tag policy<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(flora)&#38;action=history" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(flora)&#38;action=history"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_</a>(flora)&#38;action=history</a> while making his unsupported arguments that the policy doesn&#39;t say what is says.  I asked that an administrator ask him to stop inserting his personal grudge in the naming conventions policy.  In over 3 months he has gained <i>no</i> support for his stance. It&#39;s time to stop allowing him to play games that have rules written for only one person.  --<a href="" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:KP Botany">talk</a>) 22:02, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is the other half of the section above, <a href="#User:Born2cycle_-_disruption_at_WP:NC_.28flora.29" title="" />. Two policy warriors, falsely insisting beyond all reason that the long-establised flora naming convention violates the core convention, ignoring all evidence to the contrary, demanding that it <i>must</i> be rewritten in accordance with their demands, denying the existence of a strong consensus against them, arguing incessantly, edit warring on the convention page, FOR THREE F*CKING MONTHS!</dd>
<dd>The amount of plant editors&#39; time that has been wasted by these two is simply unforgiveable. It is a shame that Wikipedia is not very well equipped to deal with this kind of disruption. As I expected, posting to AN/I is pointless; these complains only end up in the too-hard basket.</dd>

<dd>If it&#39;s really a three-month-long problem and if it&#39;s been wasting people&#39;s time, then it could be worth the effort for someone to open up an <a href="" title="WP:RFC/U">WP:RFC/U</a> against one or both of these editors.

<dd>The big problem is that non-text markup in section headings can break navigation by section anchors, such as the table of contents. That&#39;s probably not what you want -it makes your section harder to navigate to, and less likely to be read, not more so.

<p> 
<a href="" title="Fatimah">Fatimah</a> was recently protected by an admin who is a main party in the dispute that has been surrounding the article since 2006. Sunni editors, namely <a href="" title="User:AA">User:AA</a> and <a href="" title="User:Itaqallah">User:Itaqallah</a>, have been removing large amounts of heavily sourced material representing the Shi&#39;a Muslim point of view concerning the death of a historical figure central to Shi&#39;a Islam. </p>
<p>At first, the websites initially used as references, namely <a href="" title="Al-islam.org">Al-islam.org</a>, were deemed by the AA and Itaqallah as polemical, though the websites are operated by the media office of the foremost religious authority of Shi&#39;a Islam, <a href="" title="Ayatollah Sistani">Ayatollah Sistani</a>, and are ideal to represent the Shi&#39;a point of view. For the sake of compromise and at the request of Itaqallah, after extensive and time-consuming research, the sources used by these websites were located as well as the passages that narrate the incident and these were inserted in the article. Itaqallah then proceeded to repeatedly remove the Shi&#39;a point of view along with the references, arguing that the sources are primary sources. According to <a href="#Religious_sources" title="Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(Islam-related_articles)">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(Islam-related_articles)</a> and <a href="#Religious_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable_source_examples">Wikipedia:Reliable_source_examples</a>, these religious sources are considered secondary sources and Itaqallah, I just noticed, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AManual_of_Style_(Islam-related_articles)&#38;diff=269436295&#38;oldid=251320162" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AManual_of_Style_(Islam-related_articles)&#38;diff=269436295&#38;oldid=251320162">deleted</a> the passage concerning religious sources in the manual of style earlier this month. </p>
<p>Unless I&#39;m mistaken, AA&#39;s protection of the article is a dangerous misuse of administrative tools and his behavior, as well as that of Itaqallah, should be dealt with accordingly and the issue should be resolved once and for all.&#60;small&#62;&#60;span class=&#34;autosigned&#34;&#62;‚ÄîPreceding <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="" title="User:94.187.80.63">94.187.80.63</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:94.187.80.63">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/94.187.80.63">contribs</a>) &#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;!-- Template:Unsigned --&#62;</p>

I understand his feelings, and several editors have tryied to work the issue out, but he is persistant. :p There is no open edit war or 3RR breaking, I believe this is the best place to ask for help. <a href="" title="User:Sephiroth storm">Sephiroth storm</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Sephiroth storm">talk</a>) 05:43, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>In <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view">Wikipedia:Neutral_point_of_view</a>, the section Bias says &#34;All editors and all sources have biases (in other words, all editors and all sources have a point of view) ‚Äî what matters is how we combine them to create a neutral article. ... When editorial bias toward one particular point of view can be detected, the article needs to be fixed&#34;. The article <a href="" title="Sri Ram Sena">Sri Ram Sena</a> violates this.</p>
<p>Though the article has news from the verified source, the editorial is biased. Anyone can easily observe this by just viewing the article of <a href="" title="Sri Ram Sena">Sri Ram Sena</a>.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fatimah_and_administrative_abuse"><a href="" title="Fatimah">Fatimah</a> and administrative abuse</span></h2>

	 
- 		 
- 	
<p> </p>	 
- 	
<p><a href="" title="Fatimah">Fatimah</a> was recently protected by an admin who is a main party in the dispute that has been surrounding the article since 2006. Sunni editors, namely <a href="" title="User:AA">User:AA</a> and <a href="" title="User:Itaqallah">User:Itaqallah</a>, have been removing large amounts of heavily sourced material representing the Shi&#39;a Muslim point of view concerning the death of a historical figure central to Shi&#39;a Islam.</p>	 
- 		 
- 	
<p>At first, the websites initially used as references, namely <a href="" title="Al-islam.org">Al-islam.org</a>, were deemed by the AA and Itaqallah as polemical, though the websites are operated by the media office of the foremost religious authority of Shi&#39;a Islam, <a href="" title="Ayatollah Sistani">Ayatollah Sistani</a>, and are ideal to represent the Shi&#39;a point of view. For the sake of compromise and at the request of Itaqallah, after extensive and time-consuming research, the sources used by these websites were located as well as the passages that narrate the incident and these were inserted in the article. Itaqallah then proceeded to repeatedly remove the Shi&#39;a point of view along with the references, arguing that the sources are primary sources. According to <a href="#Religious_sources" title="Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(Islam-related_articles)">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(Islam-related_articles)</a> and <a href="#Religious_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable_source_examples">Wikipedia:Reliable_source_examples</a>, these religious sources are considered secondary sources and Itaqallah, I just noticed, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AManual_of_Style_(Islam-related_articles)&#38;diff=269436295&#38;oldid=251320162" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia%3AManual_of_Style_(Islam-related_articles)&#38;diff=269436295&#38;oldid=251320162">deleted</a> the passage concerning religious sources in the manual of style earlier this month.</p>	 
- 		 
- 	
<p>Unless I&#39;m mistaken, AA&#39;s protection of the article is a dangerous misuse of administrative tools and his behavior, as well as that of Itaqallah, should be dealt with accordingly and the issue should be resolved once and for all.&#60;small&#62;&#60;span class=&#34;autosigned&#34;&#62;‚ÄîPreceding <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="" title="User:94.187.80.63">94.187.80.63</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:94.187.80.63">talk</a> ‚Ä¢ <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/94.187.80.63">contribs</a>) &#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;!-- Template:Unsigned --&#62;</p>

<p>Two editors disagree both with the naming policy and with each other. They have been disrupting Wikipedia flora editing for over three months now.</p>

<p><a href="" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">User:Philip Baird Shearer</a> has been tagging the policy as &#34;disputed&#34; based on his unique interpretation of Wikipedia naming policies.<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=4" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=4"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=4" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=4">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=4</a></a> He has been asked repeatedly to stop disrupting Wikipedia. He is not discussing the issue with other editors. Instead he is repeating the same points that other editors have refuted on numerous occasions, but he will allow no arguments against his pointed and disruptive unsupported declaration that Wikipedia flora naming conventions are in violation of the naming convention guidelines that refer editors to Wikipedia flora naming conventions for guidelines on naming flora articles.<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=5" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=5"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=5" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=5">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Contributions&#38;limit=500&#38;contribs=user&#38;target=Philip+Baird+Shearer&#38;namespace=5</a></a></p>

<p>His arguments may make sense to him, and this appears to be the case, that he believes he is making a supportable argument, that the general guidelines that mention using the specific guideline are being violated when you use the specific guideline that general guidelines refer the user to. However, it is not possible to discuss an issue when what a user is drawing inferences that are not supported by what he claims.</p>

<p>He continues to revert and tag policy<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(flora)&#38;action=history" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_(flora)&#38;action=history"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Naming_conventions_</a>(flora)&#38;action=history</a> while making his unsupported arguments that the policy doesn&#39;t say what is says. I asked that an administrator ask him to stop inserting his personal grudge in the naming conventions policy. In over 3 months he has gained <i>no</i> support for his stance. It&#39;s time to stop allowing him to play games that have rules written for only one person. --<a href="" title="User:KP Botany">KP Botany</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:KP Botany">talk</a>) 22:02, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>This is the other half of the section above, <a href="#User:Born2cycle_-_disruption_at_WP:NC_.28flora.29" title="" />. Two policy warriors, falsely insisting beyond all reason that the long-establised flora naming convention violates the core convention, ignoring all evidence to the contrary, demanding that it <i>must</i> be rewritten in accordance with their demands, denying the existence of a strong consensus against them, arguing incessantly, edit warring on the convention page, FOR THREE F*CKING MONTHS!</dd></dl>

<dd>The amount of plant editors&#39; time that has been wasted by these two is simply unforgiveable. It is a shame that Wikipedia is not very well equipped to deal with this kind of disruption.

<dd>This is what RFC is for, I think. Of course it&#39;s disruptive at some level, the point is that it needs to be sorted, and in a way that establishes in a way everyone can get behind, which answer is right. I don&#39;t think we can ride in with the banhammer swinging and somehow sort this, it is not that kind of dispute. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User Talk:JzG">Guy</a>&#60;/b&#62; &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 10:47, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>And also, before you get upset and think that we are attempting to enforce some ridiculous standard for verifiability, please understand that we do so because claims made without evidence are rarely done so for face value. &#34;We&#34;, that is, the pseudonymous and anonymous contributors to wikipedia, have <i>no</i> idea what constitutes &#34;white&#34; in argentina, what &#34;all-white&#34; connotes there or what importance the label carries. Even in the US, white has meant different things to different folks over the years. I could argue that &#34;white&#34; means only anglos or only anlgo-saxons (excluding southern europeans and people on the iberian penninsula). Parsing that terms is a testy business for people who have some qualifications, and &#34;we&#34; (again, those editors to wikipedia) have none. Apart from that is the problem of <a href="" title="WP:UNDUE">due weight</a>. Why is it important that an encyclopedia note that these girls are or appear to be &#34;white&#34; (assuming we can settle on a definition)? Why is it important enough to note in the article and yet not important enough for a single reliable source to mention? What are we insinuating to our readers about the basketball team? the problems are myriad. The solution is simple. Just find a source or remove the description. And as Tony says above, this isn&#39;t an issue for admin intervention. <a href="" title="User:Protonk">Protonk</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Protonk">talk</a>) 04:37, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>At least a couple of them look Hispanic to my eye, which indicates that calling them &#34;white&#34; is original research or personal interpretation. The picture&#39;s description doesn&#39;t say they&#39;re white kids, it says they are kids in a Celtic dancing class. That description seems to square with the photo, so it would be reasonable to use the photo in an article about Celtic dancing. Asserting that they are &#34;white&#34; is inappropriate not just because of the subjective nature of drawing conclusions from a photo, but also because &#34;white&#34; is a colloquial term lacking a strict definition. In fact, if &#34;white&#34; is taken to mean &#34;caucasian&#34;, then <i>everyone in Argentina</i> is &#34;white&#34;, except for those whose ancestors are aboriginal peoples or who intermarried with aboriginal peoples. In short, lacking further evidence, the picture shouldn&#39;t be used as an illustration of &#34;White Latin Americans&#34;. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 07:00, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

It&#39;s not highly noticeable since it is very small, but it is annoying to know it&#39;s there once it&#39;s spotted. I have not kept up to date on recent changes to Wikipedia so I am not aware if it is supposed to be there for any reason. I glanced through the html code of the page and I didn&#39;t see anything related to it, although I didn&#39;t scour through it. I&#39;ve also made sure it&#39;s not simply my computer or browser, as my friends can see it too. It&#39;s a slight blemish if it shouldn&#39;t be there, and so should be fixed by someone who has the rights to edit that page.</p>

<dd>The big problem is that non-text markup in section headings can break navigation by section anchors, such as the table of contents. That&#39;s probably not what you want -it makes your section harder to navigate to, and less likely to be read, not more so. The annoyance factor of colored headings (which is pretty large) is much less important than that. &#60;span style=&#34;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;‚Äî <a href="" title="User:Gavia immer">Gavia immer</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gavia immer">talk</a>)&#60;/span&#62; 20:01, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="A_question_about_a_disturbing_discussion_between_two_contributors">A question about a disturbing discussion between two contributors</span></h2>

<p>I have been monitoring on the <a href="" title="Korean cuisine">Korean cuisine</a> article for a good time now and seen (and participated in) quite a bit of drama over this article. I recently have encountered a conversation between two editors, <a href="" title="User:Melonbarmonster2">Melonbarmonster2</a> and <a href="" title="User:Santaria360">Santaria360</a>, who are discussing contacting people outside WP in order to force their views on this article.</p>
<p>The comment I am referring to is <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMelonbarmonster2&#38;diff=272440106&#38;oldid=266430695w" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AMelonbarmonster2&#38;diff=272440106&#38;oldid=266430695w">here</a>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is an issue of improper and uncivil comments on the article&#39;s talk page as well as derogatory statements towards a major contributor, <a href="" title="User:Tanner-Christopher">Chef Tanner</a>, made by Santaria. Additionally, another contributor, <a href="" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a>, has expressed concerns that Santaria&#39;s account is <a href="" title="WP:SPA">single purpose account</a> that is being used expressly to push a specific POV, to which I agree. Complicating the issue is Melonbarmonster has been repeatedly blocked over this issue, and has been feuding with other editors as well.</p>
<p>I am unsure what should be done in this situation as this is a clear violation of the policies of WP, as well as the spirit. Considering my history with this subject and these editors I am asking that an uninvolved Admin please take a look at the situation and respond as needed.</p>

<li>I would say it is ignorable.  It&#39;s a content dispute, and a pretty minor one.  If he wants to email people who are experts on Korean food then let him do just that - the more experts we get the better.  Yes it does look like he&#39;s trying to push a POV and is being resisted, but Badagnani has been around long enough to know how to handle this.  Thanks for the heads-up, ut I don&#39;t think this is actionable right now.  Have you let Badagnani know, though? &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User Talk:JzG">Guy</a>&#60;/b&#62; &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 10:31, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>I beg to disagree. He&#39;s not planning to recruit more experts, he&#39;s planning to recruit more disruption. Building up public pressure through national mass media, and pressure not only on the content of the article, but explicitly also on individual opposing editors. (The term &#34;meatpuppeting&#34;, in this context, sounds a bit weird though, doesn&#39;t it? Anyway...) </dd>
<dd>This is also not a &#34;minor&#34; content dispute. It may be lame, but it&#39;s been one of the hotspots of Korea-related ethnic feuding for years. I have long maintained that we must follow a strict zero-tolerance policy on ethnic battleground behaviour in this domain, with blocks and topic bans at least as quick as in the Balkan topics. This warrants, at the very least, a very stern warning. <a href="" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">‚òº</a> 11:42, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I&#39;m willing to drop the conversation, but if everyone here is in agreement that dog should belong along with beef, chicken, and pork in Korean food section, can you please explain to me why?  Why are you so adamant on dog being mentioned with those other staple meats?  I can go on and on about other countries‚Äô weird diets and how it‚Äôs barely a blimp on Wiki, but I‚Äôm going to focus on Korea for this argument and I‚Äôve stated my case in the discussions.  I acknowledged that dogs do get consumed in Korea.  I looked up statistics that says approx. 10% of Koreans have tried dogs in about 6,000 restaurants.  Even if that‚Äôs not exactly accurate, to me 10% or even 25% is small minority and that does not warrant dog being in same class as beef, chicken, and pork.  Also, when someone ‚Äútries‚Äù something, that doesn‚Äôt make it part of their normal diet.  Beef, chicken, and pork on the other hand are a major part of Korean diet (I would guess 90%+) and they are readily available to buy in Korean grocery stores.  Dogs are not.  You can‚Äôt buy dog meat at a grocery store, or even a butcher store.  Originally, I wanted the whole dog being part of Korean food removed, but I‚Äôm willing to find a middle ground to develop ‚Äúcontroversial food‚Äù section and put dogs and live octopus (san nak-gi) there.  But the current editors are not willing to budge and they are not giving me any reason as to why.  Even they would agree that dogs are not even close in numbers of being consumed to beef, chicken, or pork, but what‚Äôs the insistent on being in same category?  </p>
<p>As I‚Äôve stated in discussions, Korean food is a doorway to our culture and is something Koreans are very proud of.  As busy encyclopedia to topics around the world, Wikipedia should present an article as though they are explaining it to someone with no knowledge in the matter.  When you look at Korean food section (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_food" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_food">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_food</a>), dog is listed in the same category as other staple meats and the editor uses words like ‚ÄúThe most popular‚Ä¶‚Äù which insinuates that particular soup is very much consumed by mass Koreans.  This is not true and it‚Äôs misleading.  Dog consumption itself is a controversial topic in Korea because it casts negative image of a culture we are proud of.  On Yelp (<a class="externallink" href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/chosun-galbee-los-angeles" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.yelp.com/biz/chosun-galbee-los-angeles">http://www.yelp.com/biz/chosun-galbee-los-angeles</a>), there are comments like this by user on Korean restaurant review:</p>
<p>‚ÄúPierre T.: 
Excellent.
Not too sure what I should expect in a Korean restaurant but the golden retriever stuffed with a bichon frise stuffed with rotten cabbage was exquisite.‚Äù</p>
<p>With the way the Korean food section is currently written, are you able to tell me that it‚Äôll not give neophyte to Korean foods a wrong impression and warrant responses like these?  </p>
<p>Also, some of you accused me of just pushing my POV.  If that‚Äôs the case, how is what I‚Äôm doing any different than what the current editors are doing?  The current editors are pushing their POV that dogs warrant a mention in the same category as beef, chicken, and pork without any justifications.  They are not experts.  In my previous conversations Badagnani‚Äôs claim to expertise in Korean food is that he eats it a lot and has a lot of Korean friends!!!  </p>
<p>Please!  I would like to hear your excuses on why dogs warrant a mention in same sentence as other staple meats.  Fish and seafood is a major, major part of Korean diet, but the dog section is longer than that section and it doesn‚Äôt even list any Korean seafoods!!  <a href="" title="User:Santaria360">Santaria360</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Santaria360">talk</a>) 21:33, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, yes. Chosun Ilbo is a Korean mass media known for their sensationalism and sometimes blind nationalism.  I may or I may not write to the ops editor to look into how two Americans with very little knowledge in Korean Foods has the key to gateway to our culture.  Editor may or may not look into subject at matter and write about it, but if all of you think the article is currently written without a bias and without controversy, then I don&#39;t know why it matters that I would do what I can to bring the issue to national media... It would only make me look stupid <a href="" title="User:Santaria360">Santaria360</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Santaria360">talk</a>) 21:50, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Santaria, this board is not for pursuing your content dispute. That belongs on the article talk page. You are being discussed here because you were contemplating trying to build up external pressure on Wikipedia, and on your opponents personally, by soliciting external protests through non-Wikipedia channels. Don&#39;t even think of it. You are not going to get your opponents banned simply for disagreeing with you, but you may very get yourself banned in the process. Let me make it unmistakably clear: if any shit should come our way solicited through fora like Chosun Ilbo, you&#39;ll be gone in no time. <a href="" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">‚òº</a> 22:19, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>I&#39;m a causal reader of Wikipedia.  I don&#39;t know how the whole process of editing works, but I know what&#39;s currently on Korean Food section is biased and inaccurate and two people controlling the contents are incompetent.  I like Wiki and I don&#39;t want to do anything to hurt the site or bring negative publicity that brings free content of information to billions, so I rather learn and try to resolve the issue with current editors.  But at the same time, the threat of being banned from this site isn&#39;t enough to try to bring to light what I think it&#39;s unfair and if more people know the issue at hand, it&#39;s really up to them to decide what course they should take.  Again, this isn&#39;t any kind of threat to you or Wiki or any kind, like you are doing to me, and my intention is try to have it settled between disputed parties only.  My comment regarding Chosun was geared toward particular person in heat of debated moment and that&#39;s not the course I want to take.  So, I apologize for raising alarm and at this moment, only thing I ask is for you to direct me to a policy for arbituation process to dispute content<a href="" title="User:Santaria360">Santaria360</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Santaria360">talk</a>) 00:44, 23 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Regarding the question of why dog meat is discussed in the article when it isn&#39;t eaten every day, we have many items and dishes that are mentioned in the article, including very rare and special dishes that are only prepared and eaten for certain occasions, and perhaps eaten a few times a year at most. The reason we include them because we aim to be as encyclopedic as possible and thus include any and all items that are notable and of interest to our readers--and certainly dog meat is notable and of interest to our readers. Most of the contents of the section, in fact, were removed a few months ago by consensus, with most editors believing that an overlong discussion of the topic was disproportionate to the article. The question of why dog meat is mentioned when it isn&#39;t eaten every day has been addressed extensively and I did let the editor asking about this know, twice already, that such discussion may be found in the archives, yet s/he continues to ask the question repeatedly, apparently without having first read the archives. Please do that first, before continuing to raise questions that have already been answered, thanks. <a href="" title="User:Badagnani">Badagnani</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Badagnani">talk</a>) 22:36, 22 February 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>You are missing the whole point.  It&#39;s not whether dog is eaten every day or not that&#39;s a content of my argument... Beef, chicken, pork, fish, and other seafood isn&#39;t everyday.  In US, people don&#39;t eat pizza and hamburgers everyday either.  The argument is the dog eating is a minority and not a staple food.  It is also a controversial topic even in Korea, which other food dishes you mentioned are not.  No where in the article currently even mentions that dog eating in Korea is &#34;very rare&#34;.  It just says vaguely&#34;...but is not as widely consumed as beef, chicken, and pork&#34;.  If your intent is to bring &#34;interest to our readers&#34;, how come there&#39;s no link to (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_meat" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_meat">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_meat</a>).  Also, it&#39;s innappropriate to go to Korean food site to learn about dog meat.  I&#39;ll stop posting here for content dispute. <a href="" title="User:Santaria360">Santaria360</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Santaria360">talk</a>) 00:44, 23 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I think you&#39;re missing the point, and that is we seek to provide a neutral point of view and do so in such a way that presents the data as scholarly as possible. By seeking to push your point of view, you are disrupting WP. By seeking to swarm the article with people who are here only to push that point of view you are violating the rules and spirit of WP. These actions are not appropriate. That is why we are here. Again.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I&#39;ll only respond to this and we can talk about it in the Korean food discussion section.  But how is it that I&#39;m the only one &#34;pushing&#34; my POV by saying that we should create a subcategory in the article and the current editors are not &#34;pushing&#34; their POV saying the article should remain the way it is and not responding to my inquiries?  Doesn&#39;t all argument have at least two sides and two POVs?  A lot of people, the people that&#39;s been here awhile editing, talk about the spirit of WP and what WP is all about.  I thought wikipedia is a continuous revisions to make sure all the articles are free from bias and sufficiently relevent.  And I&#39;m pointing out that the way the article is and it&#39;s use of the words like &#34;Most popular dish...&#34; is not neutral in it&#39;s content (though maybe done intentionally).  And the fact that lack of description in regards to seafood, which is HUGE part of Korean diet, makes article less relevent to those that want to know.  </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>When you read the past archives of discussions, it&#39;s filled with arguments back and forth between those that want to remove dog meat and those that wants to keep it (which from reading some of the posts, you are latter).  So how is my suggestion that we SHOULD keep it, but explain with greater background some of the controversies surrounding it a not what WP is all about??? You may not agree with my suggestion to alter what&#39;s currently there, but to blindly accuse me only of &#34;pushing&#34; my POV when the opposition is doing the same with their lack of response and stubborn firm stance is itself very disturbing as to what your motives are.  I said i&#39;ll refrain from outside involvement (that issue should now be dropped) and I apologized for some comments i&#39;ve made, but who are you to stop any attempts to further improvement?  <a href="" title="User:Santaria360">Santaria360</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Santaria360">talk</a>) 03:14, 23 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Usually yes but this sort of editor is looking to escape scrutiny, not because it got too hard. Anyway, Aitias has doled out an indef so it&#39;s a case of waiting for an unblock request and see if they reform or not should a unblock be granted. Personally I reckon that they&#39;ll just move onto socking with new accounts and IP addresses so it&#39;s not like they&#39;re really gone. &#60;font color=&#34;#94887C&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Treelo">treelo</a>&#60;/font&#62; &#60;font color=&#34;#D2CDC6&#34;&#62;&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Treelo">radda</a>&#60;/sub&#62;&#60;/font&#62; 20:36, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I think this indefinite block may have been premature -- and, if Rowdy the Ant makes a request, an unblock should be granted. I have had interactions with this user for several months and I can definitely understand Ten Pound Hammer&#39;s frustrations. TPH (as well as other editors) and I have spent considerable time reverting Rowdy&#39;s edits - and encouraging him to learn policy. At the same time, as TPH mentions, Rowdy&#39;s edits often indicated he wanted to improve articles and be a helpful member of WP. Rowdy began editing last October through IP accounts (<a href="" title="User talk:76.111.64.178">User talk:76.111.64.178</a>,  <a href="" title="User talk:68.34.4.143">User talk:68.34.4.143</a>, <a href="" title="User talk:98.218.94.104">User talk:98.218.94.104</a>) which I watchlisted because of edits with OR and RS problems (not vandalism). It should be noted that Rowdy has never attempted sockpuppetry since he always <a href="" title="User:Rowdy the Ant/My Talk Pages">acknowledged</a> his IP accounts. After some encouragement, he finally registered a few weeks ago -- and began running into the problems as outlined above. I think the reality is: Rowdy tried to jump into areas (Merges, Afd, Rfa, etc.) in which he was way over his head; he has been too impatient with discussions and failed to understand policy; and he has over-reacted to disagreements. These are the traits of an immature editor, not a dedicated vandal. Should Rowdy return, he should be provided a mentor and encouraged to edit in the areas in which he has shown an interest -- <a href="" title="VeggieTales">VeggieTales</a>, <a href="" title="Toon Disney">Toon Disney</a> cartoons. etc. I think Rowdy the Ant still shows potential and, with some maturity and patience, can become an asset to WP. &#60;span style=&#34;font-family: tahoma;&#34;&#62; ‚Äî <a href="#CC5500.26quot.3B.26gt.3BWriter" title="User:CactusWriter|&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:#008000&amp;quot;&amp;gt;Cactus&amp;lt;/span&amp;gt;&amp;lt;span style=&amp;quot;color:">&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User_talk:CactusWriter">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#008000&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;needles&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62; 13:09, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I have seen the various offers of mentorship and other assistance on his talkpage, and note he is non-committal in his responses (usually asking what the offers entail). Further, while he acknowledges his previous poor behaviour there is little sense of regret. It appears that the editor projects a &#34;take it or leave it&#34; attitude toward the inappropriate editing they indulge in. The indefinite (not infinite) block is hopefully a very clear message that the community is not prepared to tolerate disruption now in the hope of useful contributions later. If he does again promise to cut out the vandalism, by all means the account should be unblocked - and blocked again as soon as they rescind. <a href="" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:LessHeard vanU">talk</a>) 13:51, 23 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I have been told to talk in english on the english wikipedia on all times - a few times I have talked on a talk page in serbocroatian too. Anyways, one user is telling me that I am not allowed to talk on my own talk page with someone about matters unrelated to wikipedia in our language. Is this true? Why is a personal discussion banned? If it is not please tell the user AlasdairGreen27 to stop harassing me on my talk page.

<dd>Your talkpage is for discussing matters related to Wikipedia.  The internet is filled with places to carry on conversations not related to Wikipedia.  Also, since this is the English Wikipedia, it is proper to carry on conversations in English, so that others who use it may understand what it is you are discussing.  There is a <a href="" title="Serbian Wikipedia">Serbian Wikipedia</a> and a <a href="" title="Croatian Wikipedia">Croatian Wikipedia</a>; which may be an appropriate venue to discuss articles in serbocroatian.  --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;contribs&#60;/small&#62;</a> 05:09, 21 February 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Agreed. If two Croatian editors choose to use Croation between themselves to speed communication on their own talk pages about matters related to Wikipedia then we usually cut them some slack, but there is certainly a general presumption that English is the right language for talk page debates and user pages and a general presumption against using Wikipedia as a general chat or discussion forum in any language. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User Talk:JzG">Guy</a>&#60;/b&#62; &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 09:09, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>We don&#39;t know one anothers emails or other stuff like that. Therefore I and many other wikipedians like to exchange some short convos on the talk page now and then.

<dd>This is the English wikipedia, and every editor has the right to know what every other editor is saying on the talk pages and articles. If you want to talk Croatian, go to the Croatian wikipedia.

<dl>
<dd>Actually, if it is only on userspace, and between two users who both know the language (and are both okay with it), there&#39;s nothing that&#39;s explicitly forbidding you from using Croatian or some other language, it is not banned, just frowned upon. (Personal experience involving chinese article, although in this case, I&#39;m not &#34;literate&#34; in chinese so I asked the other person to stick to English) A userpage is a userpage. </dd>
<dd>Now, if it is on things not related to wikipedia, then if it is considerable (aka WP:NOT#MYSPACE), then the action, not the language, is frowned upon.

<p>The following editors are going around starting trouble for anyone writing anything the slightest bit outside their tastes on the Obama page and causing general chaos on the talk pages. <a href="" title="ACORN">ACORN</a> is a big story concerning Obama as he personally worked there as a principle and this story was carried by all the networks in prime time repeatedly. Anything I or anyone else writes on the story is either deleted with blocks on the writer, done immediately within moments without warnings or archived if consensus is seen to be had. The discussions there have been turned into a rat&#39;s nest due to these continuous disruptions.</p>

<p>Further user &#34;<a href="" title="User:Brothejr">User:Brothejr</a>&#34; seems to pop out of nowhere, threatening me and others with messages that never end up at my userpage or anywhere to dif. I have missed key discussions with other editors on sourcing because they deleted pertinent discussion on this in moments of it being put up and this has warded off other editors trying to work with me. I have to dig into deleted scrambled mess to to see what they are talking about, it&#39;s very annoying. They wrongly interfering with proper editing and some are using profanity such as user <a href="" title="User:Sceptre">User:Sceptre</a> in the Voter Fraud section (which should have &#34;ACORN&#34; in the title but this is guarded and immediately deleted).

One editor working with me: <a href="" title="User:Die4Dixie">User:Die4Dixie</a> has &#34;retired&#34; from Wikipedia due to all this.

Without specific diffs for the claims, I tend to agree with Bugs that this is just a continuation of the usual problems there. <a href="" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 08:19, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>No edits under that name, anyway. Again, that&#39;s for the experts to consider. Ironically, Die4Dixie leveled some strong criticism at Rattttso&#39;s approach <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ratttso&#38;diff=271304919&#38;oldid=271289011" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ratttso&#38;diff=271304919&#38;oldid=271289011"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ratttso&#38;diff=271304919&#38;oldid=271289011" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ratttso&#38;diff=271304919&#38;oldid=271289011">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Ratttso&#38;diff=271304919&#38;oldid=271289011</a></a>. As far as any admin action to take... well, they could start by blanking Rattttso&#39;s pages and taking away his ability to edit said pages, as he is using them only for soapboxing. As far as Larrrry2 is concerned, his activities probably bear watching. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 08:22, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>Bugs, maybe you can take a minute to enlighten me as to what this is about? It&#39;s OT here so on my talk page maybe. Are the cons claiming that Obama&#39;s election was nearly as fraudulent as Dubya&#39;s first? That would be quite funny given the size of his majority. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User Talk:JzG">Guy</a>&#60;/b&#62; &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 10:25, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<ul>
<li>ACORN is an organization that was active in recruiting new voters. A lot of them apparently voted Democratic, as previously disenfranchised voters often do, and some Republican supporters are trying to... well, I&#39;m not sure what they&#39;re trying to do. They&#39;re not going to overturn the election. So basically they&#39;re just trying smear Obama with what is essentially now a dead news story. And as you say, where were they in 2000 and 2004, when the shoe was on the other foot? Pushing for Bush&#39;s election and re-election, of course. So these guys are just using wikipedia as a partisan playground, trying to get away with as much POV-pushing as they can. <a href="" title="User:Baseball Bugs">Baseball Bugs</a> &#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Baseball Bugs">What&#39;s up, Doc?</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 11:28, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>User talk pages are usually used to communicate with others, should a particular problem arise in their editing behavior, or there is a current situation regarding what they are editing, say either edits they are making violating policy, or the article they&#39;re currently editing getting promoted to feature status.  Either way, they&#39;re not supposed to promote a poisonous atmosphere, as such would be caused by <i>banning people from one&#39;s talk page</i>.  I may be wrong, but I&#39;ve seen that general consensus was that such sections should be removed; now, I may be wrong in this case, but the talk page of <a href="" title="User:Tarysky">User:Tarysky</a> seems like either a civility violation, or one that is walking dangerously close to that line.  Opinions please?‚Äî <b><a href="" title="User:Daedalus969">&#60;font color=&#34;Green&#34;&#62;D√¶&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Daedalus969">dŒ±lus</a>&#60;sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Daedalus969">&#60;font color=&#34;Green&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62;</b> 05:45, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>Also, as can be seen from the user&#39;s block log, this user has made civilty violations before.‚Äî <b><a href="" title="User:Daedalus969">&#60;font color=&#34;Green&#34;&#62;D√¶&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Daedalus969">dŒ±lus</a>&#60;sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Daedalus969">&#60;font color=&#34;Green&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62;</b> 05:46, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I don&#39;t see how banning someone from one&#39;s talkpage creates a poisonous atmosphere; it would seem more apt to say that would discourage the interaction of antagonistic editors. It is not an uncommon practice. &#60;font color=&#34;404040&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Skomorokh">&#60;font face=&#34;Goudy Old Style&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Skomorokh&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 05:52, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Furthermore, unless you&#39;re shopping to have the user blocked or their talkpage deleted, this discussion would be better suited to <a href="" title="WP:WQA">WP:WQA</a>, <a href="" title="WT:TALK">WT:TALK</a> or <a href="" title="WT:USER">WT:USER</a>. &#60;font color=&#34;404040&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Skomorokh">&#60;font face=&#34;Goudy Old Style&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Skomorokh&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 05:55, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>How is telling someone that you&#39;re currently in conflict with they aren&#39;t allowed to edit your page not poisonous?  I don&#39;t know about you, but it gives off a bad air when anyone starts trying to dictate something that isn&#39;t theirs.  Yes, I see the small &#39;disclaimer&#39; at the bottom, but the way I see it, such a thing is rather pointless; the &#34;stay the hell of my talk page&#34; order is still there.  Poisonous may not be the right word, but the way the user has said such things certaintly isn&#39;t civil.  I&#39;ve seen such &#34;rules&#34; deleted as being uncivil before.  I probably have the page watched, let me see if I can find it.‚Äî <b><a href="" title="User:Daedalus969">&#60;font color=&#34;Green&#34;&#62;D√¶&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Daedalus969">dŒ±lus</a>&#60;sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Daedalus969">&#60;font color=&#34;Green&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62;</b> 05:58, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>It&#39;s his talk page.  Just unwatch it.  If he refuses to discuss matters <i>anywhere</i>, that is a matter for dispute resolution.  Also, <i>you</i> reverting <i>him</i> on his (just assuming <a href="" title="Sexist">male pronoun</a> here) talk page places you in the wrong.  Users have a wide latitude on their own talk page.  I&#39;m not thrilled that the page has &#34;rules&#34;, but some users do that.  IMO, I&#39;ve found that you are better off ignoring people who insist on turning their talk pages into fiefdoms. <a href="" title="User:Protonk">Protonk</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Protonk">talk</a>) 06:06, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>And it&#39;s not that I have a general problem with the rules themselves, it is more of a problem concerning the following statement: <i>Certain users are not allowed to comment or removed anything from this page. These users know who <b>they are</b>. So if <b>you are one</b> and <b>know you are</b>, <b>stay off this page</b>. No controvesy is needed. Currently, there are 3 users.</i>  Telling people what to do like this is out of line in my opinion concerning matters of civility.‚Äî <b><a href="" title="User:Daedalus969">&#60;font color=&#34;Green&#34;&#62;D√¶&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Daedalus969">dŒ±lus</a>&#60;sup&#62; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Daedalus969">&#60;font color=&#34;Green&#34;&#62;Contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62;</b> 06:13, 22 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Who would even read that notice? I couldn&#39;t get past the first two lines. Most of the stuff discussed on Wikipedia can be discussed on article talk pages or policy pages. If you need to post a warning on the user&#39;s page, just post it. The user can then revert if he/she wants, established he/she read it. That&#39;s all. Wikipedia has plenty of useful contributors who are very young.  This sounds like one of them.  Don&#39;t get too bothered by a child acting like a child.

<p>(OD)I&#39;d just ignore him, Daedalus. If you have something that needs to go on his page, post it there. Him removing it means he&#39;s seen it, just like the rest of us.

<dd>I am the editor specifically &#34;banned&#34; by Tarysky because I initiated a previous ANI which led to a short block.  I haven&#39;t had any interaction with this user since, although I will say his less-than-civil attitude remains unchanged and the amount of inappropriate copyrighted images he has uploaded to Wikipedia is reason enough to keep an eye on him.  If he wants to &#34;ban&#34; me from his page, it doesn&#39;t bother me... if I feel that it is necessary to discuss one of his edits or leave a message or warning on his page I will do so anyway. - <a href="" title="User:Ericorbit">eo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ericorbit">talk</a>) 14:00, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with your first sentence, but I can&#39;t agree with your second - one shouldn&#39;t feel constrained by such bans, but neither should they be ignored, if ignoring them would just cause dispute, disruption, bad feelings, point-scoring, etc. without improving the encyclopedia. Use common sense in dealing with such things - that may mean walking around a bear&#39;s den rather than yelling &#34;This isn&#39;t prohibited!&#34; into it. &#60;span  style=&#34;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;‚Äî <a href="" title="User:Gavia immer">Gavia immer</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gavia immer">talk</a>)&#60;/span&#62; 20:28, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>While I have posted in this thread that Daedelus should probably just ignore your page (rather than ask an administrator to remove it), you are on pretty thin ice.  Don&#39;t accuse someone of &#34;acting childish&#34; if you can help it.  Your best course of action is to remove that &#34;ban&#34; (As it is unenforceable, unimportant and uncivil).  Barring that, you should not act to inflame the issue with needless accusations.  If your intent is that Daedelus not post on your talk page, just revert posts he makes with a note explaining why.  Pretty soon, he won&#39;t frequent it.  But I&#39;ll also note that others will stop frequenting it as well.  Getting into a habit of setting up arbitrary rules will not earn you respect and admiration.

<dd>As I said above, I&#39;ll say so again, here, where it can easily be seen.  If he isn&#39;t willing to stop personally attacking people, and if he isn&#39;t willing to accept that he did something wrong, I do not see this user being a constructive contributor here if he is just going to continue to violate our personal attack and civility policies, not to mention this misleading edit summery business.

<dd>Having recently interacted (in a peaceful manner) with this user, I don&#39;t find the current #12 a felony; it&#39;s only on a user talk page, and it doesn&#39;t name any specific users.  I don&#39;t like it, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s something highly disruptive.  However, I think it reasonable to consider this user somewhat on probation as far as attacks go.  Moreover, if the user goes back to having any specific attacks on the page, there&#39;s no reason not to remove it, and such should be treated as a personal attack anywhere else would be.  In this specific case, it would be reasonable to block if the user continues to add the attacks, regardless of the statement that &#34;it is bad faith, vandalism, bad definition of character for anyone who reverts it.&#34;  <a href="" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nyttend">talk</a>) 18:15, 23 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Blogging4truth_SSP">Blogging4truth SSP</span></h2>

<p>Please see <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Blogging4truth/Archive">Wikipedia:Sockpuppet_investigations/Blogging4truth/Archive</a> for the details. It&#39;s a mixture of BLP vios, trolling, spamming and socking so I am posting here. The case just closed as it seemed that no one could agree on how to proceed or what was necessary, but there is a distinct pattern to the edits and an obvious intent to self promote and inflame. The final recoemmendation was to bring it up here. It seemed clear to everyone who commented in the case and outside of it that the sockpuppets are clearly him and that the contributions were all both predictable and highly undesirable. There have been no edits since the SSP case was opened but there has never been any discussion from the editor(s) and from the wide range of articles edited in the past it will not be obvious where he will appear next without following his blog to see what the next topic is. There is a WPSPAM case on michaelcrook.net too. <a href="" title="User:Mfield">Mfield</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mfield">talk</a>) 03:50, 21 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>A few observations. The name is painfully reminiscent of <a href="" title="User:Kossack4Truth">User:Kossack4Truth</a>, one of last year&#39;s most disagreeable sockpuppets - although the editing patterns are not at all similar.

Speaking of that, why is the <a href="" title="Michael Crook">Michael Crook</a> article salted? The reasons for deletion were invalid at least in light of what we now know (he is real, he is notable,<a class="externallink" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6167752-7.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6167752-7.html"><a class="externallink" href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6167752-7.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6167752-7.html">http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-6167752-7.html</a></a> and has been involved in well reported lawsuits raising Internet privacy and DMCA copyright issues).<a class="externallink" href="http://www.eff.org/cases/diehl-v-crook" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.eff.org/cases/diehl-v-crook"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.eff.org/cases/diehl-v-crook" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.eff.org/cases/diehl-v-crook">http://www.eff.org/cases/diehl-v-crook</a></a><a class="externallink" href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/crook-v-10-zen-monkeys" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/crook-v-10-zen-monkeys"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/crook-v-10-zen-monkeys" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/crook-v-10-zen-monkeys">http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/crook-v-10-zen-monkeys</a></a> Like it or not you can self-promote your way to notoriety off-Wikipedia, and that notoriety may well make a person notable for Wikipedia purposes. The COI editing and sockpuppetry are a different matter, one we should take seriously in light of the person&#39;s being in the profession, apparently, of creating Internet scandals about himself.<a href="" title="User:Wikidemon">Wikidemon</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wikidemon">talk</a>) 00:02, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Shouldn&#39;t be necessary to CU, these are all blindingly obvious - his MO is to cite himself, link his name and add links to his blog or other blogs quoting him. Our old friend the <a href="" title="WP:DUCK">Canard Abuse Detector</a> is probably adequate to the task for now. The consensus at the last deletion debate was that any notability (or more accuratley notoriety) was passed; the rate of comment on him was low and appears to me to be tailing off. Michael Moore he ain&#39;t. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User Talk:JzG">Guy</a>&#60;/b&#62; &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:JzG/help">Help!</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 10:23, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>So then we assume it&#39;s all sockpuppeting by the person in question? The !vote was 9-7 in favor of deletion (7-5 if one discounts the contributions the closing administrator stated as discounted) but the entire process was problematic - canvassing, sockpuppetry, manipulation, and it would be hard to say that the decision was made on grounds of notability. Notability doesn&#39;t diminish over time - either the subject is notable or he is not. He does formally meet WP:BIO - full articles / segments devoted to him over a span of years on a variety of subjects on CNN, Fox News, and some less significant publications. Most of that coverage came <i>after</i> the AfD, so it is not controlling. There&#39;s no policy reason why the article cannot be recreated. The salting seemed to be out of frustration.<a href="" title="User:Wikidemon">Wikidemon</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wikidemon">talk</a>) 11:08, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Which is one of the reasons I finally decided to just open an ANI section on it for help.<a href="" title="User:Mosedschurte">Mosedschurte</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mosedschurte">talk</a>) 23:54, 23 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Dear <a href="" title="User:Mosedschurte">Mosedschurte</a>, &#60;br /&#62;Try to think about the following. I <i>never</i> had such problems with other editors before. You had<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mosedschurte&#38;oldid=239202687#Please_stop" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mosedschurte&#38;oldid=239202687#Please_stop"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mosedschurte&#38;oldid=239202687#Please_stop" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mosedschurte&#38;oldid=239202687#Please_stop">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Mosedschurte&#38;oldid=239202687#Please_stop</a></a>. I <i>never</i> cited the sources unaccurately. <a href="#Forced_labor_of_Germans_in_the_Soviet_Union" title="User talk:Mosedschurte">You did</a>.&#60;br /&#62;However, we have something in common: we both are growing weary as a result of fruitless disputes. As I already pointed out several times, a third opinion would be helpful to find a way out of impasse. If you don&#39;t like this idea, maybe informal mediation, or formal mediation, or arbitration would better satisfy you?--<a href="" title="User:Paul Siebert">Paul Siebert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Paul Siebert">talk</a>) 00:29, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>--Not that this is particularly new, but it is yet another completely baseless accusation.

<dd>--Note, with all of the other baseless attacks from this editor above, that this baseless attack is not particularly new. Rather, it&#39;s become quite expected.

<dd>--Any attempt to now at this late hour -- after all of the violations -- to make this look like some &#34;tit-for-tat&#34; dispute between two editors isn&#39;t going to work.  This editors&#39; repeated violations are cataloged at length above (I won&#39;t bother re-linking), as well as my repeated attempts to work with him (also linked above) and repeated cleanups of his work (also above).  Along with just the latest (the 3RR here).</dd>
<dd>--As mentioned, I&#39;ve repeatedly kept myself from coming to ANI with the various threats, attacks and edit warring in the hopes of avoiding that hassle, sometimes including agreeing to add material I don&#39;t even think belongs into articles (I won&#39;t bother re-linking the above).  This was a last resort with this editor.<a href="" title="User:Mosedschurte">Mosedschurte</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mosedschurte">talk</a>) 00:53, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>--That&#39;s not accurate, and I think me not originally bringing your various violations to ANI upfront may have caused the misunderstanding that this continued editing practice was okay . </dd>
<dd>--It&#39;s not a content dispute at this point.  Rather, it&#39;s long series of threats, false accusations, 3RR and other Wikipedia violations that require administrative action. Were it just a content dispute, it would be for the Talk page, not the ANI board.  In fact, pending this ANI issue, I haven&#39;t even bothered editing the various grammar mistakes in the latest paragraph you inserted, much less re-entering in it&#39;s actual chronological spot.

<dd>It isn&#39;t really a threat (in fact, it doesn&#39;t even make much sense in that context). It can&#39;t hurt to refer it to the local police, of course, but informing the FBI seems like overkill. Moreover, a review of the other edits from that IP suggest he or she is making more a childish point about school rivalries, than any violent threats. Finally, if anyone does wish to pursue this further there is a fairly large clue in the contribs, as to the name of the person behind it. <a href="" title="User:Rockpocket">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;Rockpock&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;e&#60;/font&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Rockpocket">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;t&#60;/font&#62;</a> 02:16, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>If you ask me, it&#39;s borderline.  Now if he said &#34;there <i>will</i> be a lot of school shootings&#34;, that would be a threat.  This could also be regular unsourced commentary.

<li>3) In four months the user has not edited a single article except <a href="" title="Don Stewart (preacher)">Don Stewart (preacher)</a>.</li>
<li>4) This editor says he is in personal contact with the preacher/association and is <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VirtualSteve&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=270278878" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:VirtualSteve&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=270278878">writing a book</a> on the subject/Stewart.

<li>5) This user&#39;s motivation is clear and his edits as well as discussions are unproductive.</li></ul>

<p>As the diffs show, this user is attempting to white wash established facts on an article he is personally tied to. The material below starts with simple obstructing edits and misquoting policy to flat out lies, vandalism, and <a href="" title="WP:TE">WP:TE</a>. To keep the material off he simply says its &#34;controversial&#34; then misstates wikipedia policy without giving any specific or clear reason. I have not found one productive edit by this user in his four months of editing on wikipedia. As such, I think the adminstrators should provide sanctions for his <a href="" title="WP:TE">disruptive behavior</a>. I recommend at least barring him from editing the Stewart article per <a href="" title="WP:COI">WP:COI</a> if not a stronger punishment to keep this behavior from happening again. <a href="" title="User:BBiiis08">BBiiis08</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:BBiiis08">talk</a>) 09:46, 22 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I&#39;m not an admin, but I feel that allowing people to alter their talk page comments would be a bad idea. There&#39;s a reason we tell people not to modify the archived discussion, in big red lettres. The archive is a record of the closed discussion, preserved for all to see. Records of discussions should not be removed or altered except with a very compelling reason, such as an Oversighter might have. altering archived discussions juse because they were a bit uncivil has never been our way. &#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Copperplate Gothic Bold&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Firestorm">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;<b><i>Firestorm</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Firestorm">&#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;<b><i>Talk</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/span&#62; 17:27, 23 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>The first diff was unnecessary and you were right to revert it. What&#39;s the point of adding a comment like that to a closed discussion?

<dd>If you were angry enough to write <a href="" title="WP:DICK">WP:DICKish</a> comments on an AfD in the first place, then they probably also led to further comments based on it.  Refactoring should not be done, else context change.  Strikethroughs make no sense in that case either - at least once the AfD is closed for archive.  Make amends elsewhere.

<dd>I agree with this. Changing comments on an archived AfD makes the readable decision-making process misleading. Apologies and other <a href="" title="WP:CIVIL">WP:CIVIL</a> reconsiderations after closure should occur on the AfD Talk page. Strikethroughs should be allowed on Talk pages in general, but not on closed/archived discussions&#38;mdash;the latter lends itself to bad-faith edits, such as sanitizing one&#39;s edit history, and outweighs any potential WP:CIVIL benefit.</dd>

<dd>The few times I&#39;ve ever edited an archived page I try to make it clear that it is an after-the-fact edit rather than rewriting history.

<p> </p>
<p><a href="" title="User: MikFantastik">User: MikFantastik</a>, a new contributor, recently vandalized the article <a href="" title="Too Beautiful to Live">Too Beautiful to Live</a> by removed an unflattering, but verifiable (22 source citations), section titled &#34;Controversies&#34; (which is a normal section for radio hosts entries, see <a href="" title="Don Imus">Don Imus</a>, <a href="" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a>, etc.). Following this he started lodging frivolous complaints about me everywhere. This is all being dealt with through normal channels such as dispute resolution, editing, etc., I mention it just for context and background. (Apparently he is a member of the fan club of the article topic, which may explain his edit.)</p>
<p>However, as part of his - apparent - extreme irritation at my additions to the article, he edited my userpage with a note that suggested I was psychologically impaired and suggestion I call a suicide hotline. (I don&#39;t understand his comment about &#34;trolling&#34; &#34;the website&#34;, unless he meant my edits to their article, but I could be mistaken, I didn&#39;t understand much of it.) To wit:</p>
<p><i>Can you explain why you&#39;re so angry at the show/Luke that you&#39;d spend almost five hours vandalizing its Wikipedia page and that you&#39;d return frequently to the TBTL website to Troll its comments section? Is it just because you think it upsets other people and you&#39;re enjoying that process? I&#39;m just trying to understand. As I&#39;ve said before, this is fascinating! I also feel a little sad for you. Please feel free to call 877-870-HOPE (4673) if you&#39;d like to talk. I&#39;ve definitely worked with people who have psychological profiles similar to yours and though I don&#39;t know you, I worry.</i></p>
<p>I hope MikFantastic can be a long and fruitful contributor to the community, but I fear that will never happen unless some type of sanction is imposed on him as a corrective action in lieu of this early warning sign of potential disruption. Clearly suggesting someone call a suicide hotline - especially when left on a UserPage, not Talk - goes far beyond a simple personal attack and could be construed as a death threat.</p>

<dd>I don&#39;t think it can be construed as a death threat because the user is not implying that someone is going to kill you. It&#39;s clearly not a particularly nice thing to write because it implies some sort of mental illness and is clearly a personal attack (for the time being, glossing over the using mental illness as an insult). MikFantastic ought to receive a warning for that. However, unless you can be certain that it was MikFantastik who removed the information, then you can&#39;t state it as fact. The only sourced content I see MikFantastik removing is <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Too_Beautiful_to_Live&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=272271937" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Too_Beautiful_to_Live&#38;diff=next&#38;oldid=272271937">here</a>, which I agree with because it isn&#39;t neutral.

<dd>In response to your questions (I apologize in advance for several syntax and grammar errors in below, I&#39;m in a remote area with a limited, slow internet connection at present that makes editing and typing rather slow and tedious):</dd>
<dd><b>Multiple User Vandals</b> - Yes, most likely they are multiple users. I&#39;ve previously noted the topic of this article may have requested his fan club begin &#34;patroling&#34; his wikipedia page, which strikes me as tampering. At the present time I think it would heighten tensions for me to pursue that so, in the spirit of trying to difuse tensions, have elected not to do so. In addition to editing my personal userpage, these users have insinuated various scurrious things about me, note above mentions of me being a &#34;troll&#34; [sic] on &#34;their website&#34;, which I assume means they believe the topic&#39;s wikipedia entry is off-limits? (I really don&#39;t know.) In any case, my interst at this point is simply to diffuse tension and allow everyone to take a breather but I&#39;d still rather not be called mentally unstable on my own userpage. Don&#39;t you agree? I&#39;m sure you do. </dd>
<dd><b>&#34;potentially disputable sentences&#34;</b> - were added with 22 citations, not &#34;without any citations.&#34;These were immediately deleted by above new users without discussion or explanation. The article now stands as a 3-page long article on a local radio show with 1 citation of dubious quality. Requests for citations by myself and others on the vandalized version of the article have been deleted without discussion. Notability and ad tags by myself and others have been deleted without discussion. </dd>
<dd><b>re speedy deletion</b> - that was, frankly, an error on my part; one which I have no problem in admitting and taking responsbility for </dd>
<dd><b>dispute resolution</b> - please see the discussion page for this article for further clarification; as I&#39;ve noted I&#39;m OOT at present and unable to commit the time to initiate the process for formal mediation as I&#39;ve never had to do it before so there will be a learning curve for me -- in my note on the discussion page I&#39;ve explained that - to avoid an edit war - I will avoid undoing the vandalism and replacing the, fully cited, sections that were deleted without discussion or explanation by users registered less than 24 hours whose only edit history is on this article until I have the opportunity to begin formal mediation; I believe this is a congenial, proactive and respectful way to handle this matter - I have no desire to engage in the type of unilateral action the vandals did or to perpetuate ill will and have both voluntarily placed the onus for reconstruction of the article on myself and indicated a willingness to voluntarily suspend corrective editing until mediation can begin ... in the interim I&#39;m simply asking the vandals not edit my actual userpage as well as the article or, if they do, at least please don&#39;t post numbers to suicide hotlines - I don&#39;t believe that&#39;s an unreasonable request and it&#39;s the only one I&#39;m making in this incident report </dd>

<p>Hi all, just a query involving <a href="" title="WP:ARBMAC">WP:ARBMAC</a>. I dealt with <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring#Monshuai_reported_by_Fut.Perf._.28Result:_48hr_block_.29" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard/Edit_warring#Monshuai_reported_by_Fut.Perf._.28Result:_48hr_block_.29">this</a> 3RR report and noticed that the user had been warned for revert warring and had received an ARBMAC sanction warning back in August. Just wondering if this should be carried out as this is the 2nd time the user has been blocked for edit warring on the Bulgarian article. Thoughts and suggestions welcome. Thanks in advance. <a href="" title="User:Scarian">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34; face=&#34;tahoma&#34;&#62;Scarian&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User_talk:Scarian">&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;Call me Pat!&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 15:39, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Just because it was me who brought it up: Yes, I would say something from the ARBMAC repertoire ‚Äì preferably a revert limitation ‚Äì would be useful. This is a user motivated by a strong POV issue, certainly editing in good faith and quite possibly with some kernel of a legitimate concern somewhere, but pushing rather stubbornly against an established dominant view, and so far he has shown no other strategy than to revert-war when he finds opposition. This is exactly the type of user whose only chance of ever editing more happily is if he&#39;s forced to stop the reverting. (And if he can&#39;t do that, it will soon show and he&#39;ll have to go.) <a href="" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">‚òº</a> 15:50, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

That last sentence might not make sense, but here&#39;s a summary: I brought the ARBMAC request here because I haven&#39;t had much experience dealing with these things in the past so I&#39;m seeking guidance.

<dd>Monshuai is not here all that much, but when he is here, he is an ethnic POV-warrior of the first order, usually on articles related to Bulgaria. Discussions seem to make no impression on him whatever; he knows he is right and that is all that matters. Look at a few of the items in <a href="" title="Special:WhatLinksHere/User:Monshuai">Special:WhatLinksHere/User:Monshuai</a> to get the flavor. He was <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Monshuai&#38;diff=229969036&#38;oldid=229968441" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Monshuai&#38;diff=229969036&#38;oldid=229968441">warned</a> on 5 August 2008 that he could be sanctioned under <a href="" title="WP:ARBMAC">WP:ARBMAC</a>, but made no appropriate response. He simply removed the notice from his Talk.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>

<dd>Since Monshuai causes trouble only in brief bursts, and then disappears for several months at a time, a short block or topic ban would have little effect. I suggest a *permanent* topic ban on Balkan-related topics. He would be allowed to request removal of the ban after three months, and editors could judge the sincerity of his reform at that time. The ban would be announced on his Talk  page by an administrator, and then listed at <a href="#Log_of_blocks_and_bans" title="Wikipedia:ARBMAC">Wikipedia:ARBMAC</a>. <a href="" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:EdJohnston">talk</a>) 16:39, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

But the source cited doesn&#39;t support anything of the kind: Avila is asked if he knew the man referred to in the controversies section, and he replies merely that he met the man as a teenager and vaguely that he supported what his own party did to fight communism. That source is given <a class="externallink" href="http://www.elfaro.net/secciones/Noticias/20030428/Platicas1_20030428.asp" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.elfaro.net/secciones/Noticias/20030428/Platicas1_20030428.asp">here.</a> And beyond that, the IP that keeps adding it rapidly changes address and completely refuses to discuss the matter, except for asking me to clarify my position on my talk page (after which he continued to institute the BLP violation).

<dd>I don&#39;t think IAR is a good rationale to wheel-war my decision. You could have at least asked for my input, not just ignore my decision. And I still maintain it was correct to decline protection because blocking the IP is still the easier option that does not shut out all anon editors (per <a href="" title="WP:PROTECT">WP:PROTECT</a> this should be preferred). <b><a href="" title="User:SoWhy">&#60;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps; color: #AC0000&#34;&#62;So&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:SoWhy">&#60;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps; color: #1F3F53&#34;&#62;Why&#60;/span&#62;</a></b> 10:42, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I&#39;ll agree that you should have been (at least) notified; I would have asked, but that&#39;s because I tend to be process-oriented. But as to the first, the duck test pretty clearly establishes that all of the IP addresses are the same individual, or a small group working together, since the only edits they have are to (re)insert the same defamatory and <a href="" title="WP:SYN">synthesized</a> allegations against a living individual. Blocking any of the IPs would not have had any effect, as simply logging off and resetting the modem would have established a new IP address. <b><a href="" title="User:Horologium">&#60;font color=&#34;DarkSlateGray&#34;&#62;Horologium&#60;/font&#62;</a></b> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Horologium">(talk)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 12:30, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Sorry to disagree here and for bringing the content dispute here, but on my reading of the interview that was cited as a source, there seems to be a solid basis for saying that this guy &#34;supports&#34; d&#39;Aubuisson. I was about to revert, but I don&#39;t want to risk getting blocked for BLP violation without discussing first. Could the admins who have mentioned BLP please register that there is some substantial disagreement here. <a href="" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">‚òº</a> 12:48, 24 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Could you translate it? Either way, Wikipedia doesn&#39;t do guilt by association. Well, <a href="" title="A Scientific Dissent from Darwinism">it does</a>, but shouldn&#39;t. We can say he supports d&#39;Aubuisson, and/or which parts of him, but what d&#39;Aubisson does is strictly off-limits for the biography of √Åvila. Doubly so, because he&#39;s a presidential candidate. <b><a href="" title="User:Sceptre">Sceptre</a></b> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Sceptre">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 17:16, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Well, he is going on at length about how D&#39;Aubuisson &#34;would be pround of him&#34; and how he has been following D&#39;Aubuisson&#39;s model and why he is proud of having photographs of D&#39;Aubuisson in his office and how D&#39;Aubuisson was generally a great guy. As for whether this attachment (his, personally) is a topic for public &#34;controversy&#34; in the country, I can&#39;t say much; I have no idea about the political life of that place, but foreign media certainly do stress the heritage of D&#39;Aubuisson when talking about the role of his party, and you can easily find things like this <a class="externallink" href="http://www.dissidentvoice.org/2008/03/el-salvador-in-the-months-before-the-2009-elections/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.dissidentvoice.org/2008/03/el-salvador-in-the-months-before-the-2009-elections/"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.dissidentvoice.org/2008/03/el-salvador-in-the-months-before-the-2009-elections/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.dissidentvoice.org/2008/03/el-salvador-in-the-months-before-the-2009-elections/">http://www.dissidentvoice.org/2008/03/el-salvador-in-the-months-before-the-2009-elections/</a></a> (a political comment whose status as a &#34;reliable source&#34; is certainly open to debate, but you get an idea of the potential for controversy.) Quote: <i>&#34;His [i.e. √Åvila&#39;s] immediate imprecation to the ghost of the death squad founder and intellectual author of the assassination of Archbishop Oscar Romero, Roberto D‚ÄôAubuisson is a chilling reminder that the structure of power in El Salvador will not give up their privilege [...]&#34;</i>. By the way, &#34;guilt by association&#34; is a red herring here. If A likes B, although B is widely agreed to be evil, and I take that as grounds for a negative judgment about A, that&#39;s not &#34;guilt by association&#34; but an entirely rational judgment. &#34;Guilt by association&#34; would be if I negatively judge A because B likes him. <a href="" title="User:Future Perfect at Sunrise">Fut.Perf.</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Future Perfect at Sunrise">‚òº</a> 20:52, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Slrubenstein, I assume you are supporting Jayjg&#39;s complaint because you got all worked up you forgot to actually read the posting I made.  Brewcrewer don&#39;t get your pantys all up in a bunch.  As far as this tempest in a teacup I have been editing a lot of IP articles since I joined, so a person could think I was hounding Jayjg.  I don&#39;t have any prior experience editing on wikipedia but have followed some history of wikipedia by reading the site wikipediareview. I don&#39;t think that site is looked kindly upon here but whatever, and there is sort of a go-after-the-new-guy mentality by some here. Ive been learning a lot this week of the ins and outs here, and if you edit articles others are attached then watch out boy!  Reading up on wikihounding and then looking at this complaint, I was probably on the border of that for merger request for the Temple articles, I didn&#39;t realize that looking at a particular editors contributions when determining who made all those stubs was against the rules here.  My proposals of merger were worthy of a discussion, and it is unfortunate that all of those proposals were deleted by the articles creator for an unrelated reason.  Also, I was not trying to subtly put Jayjg&#39;s username into the CAMERA article, I was trying to expand the description of the events, you can see my discussion of the CAMERA on the discussion page <a href="" title="Talk:Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America">Talk:Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America</a> and it is disingenuous to take one edit as an example of hounding.  For the Labor Party donation scandal i added a source I knew of, someone reverted that. <a href="" title="User:TWilliams9">TWilliams9</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TWilliams9">talk</a>) 00:08, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>However, your claims are not credible.

Plain and simple it was an edit that was an attempt to better wikipedia.

<dd>I&#39;ve been here for nearly a year now and have yet to try to delete stuff.  There are patrols for that.

<p>TWilliams tagged a bunch of non-notable articles with a merger talk and created a section to discuss it. Perhaps it&#39;s out of line, but he did what he was suppose to as far as the articles go. Just becaue Jayjg created them doesn&#39;t suddenly make them immune from TWilliams editing. If I saw them for the first time, I would have tagged them just the same. <b><a href="" title="User:Grsz11">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Grsz&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Grsz11">&#60;b&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;11&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/b&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62;</b> 04:10, 23 February 2009 (UTC)

I made 2 consecutive edits to Kazan, and if you read above CNN has named him as one of the top 10 snitches of all time.  The Blaumilch Canal article had no citations at all, it is appropriate to add a fact tag to that.  With Fatah you keep lying and then reverting my well sourced information and trying to game the system.  For the synagogue merger proposal I didn&#39;t realize initially that Beth Isreal was a name like St. Mary&#39;s, I thought it was some denomination.

Bernard was apparently <i>not</i> a puppetmaster, just another puppet IMO.  Should we call in <a href="" title="007">007</a> for this one?</p>
<p>BTW, one of the aforementioned users twice last week sent me a virus posing as a Wiki &#34;New Message&#34; alert.  The first time it took down my computer until I found and removed it.  The second attempt I blocked and I also saved the source code, with the virus easily spotted.  --<a href="" title="User:Wikiwatcher1">Wikiwatcher1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wikiwatcher1">talk</a>) 03:26, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p><a href="" title="User:THF">THF</a> pointed out to me on my talk page earlier about another user,   and its potential connection to the above.  Well, this morning I noticed that  , aka <b>Tom</b>, edited two articles I just worked on, <a href="" title="Jeff Bezos">Jeff Bezos</a> and <a href="" title="Elia Kazan">Elia Kazan</a>.  He also just edited <a href="" title="Jeff Ballabon">Jeff Ballabon</a>, which, as THF noticed, was also edited by both   and (now blocked)  .</p>
<p>IMO, this has gone way beyond mere coincidence.  Can anyone check on these links? --<a href="" title="User:Wikiwatcher1">Wikiwatcher1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wikiwatcher1">talk</a>) 19:05, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Appears to be nonsense. I reverted the changes by TWilliams9 and protected his Talk page. <a href="" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:EdJohnston">talk</a>) 01:51, 25 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
