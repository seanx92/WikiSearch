<p>When ten-year old Coop Burtonburger’s spoiled 8-year-old sister Millie (who turns 9 in season 2 and would turn 10 in season 3),  brings home a mysterious stray cat, Coop&#39;s idyllic life is turned upside down. Coop soon discovers that Kat is more than just a scrawny, purple, hairless pet; he is also a super-smart, conniving mastermind, and Kat&#39;s also an alien with a fanatical hate for Coop himself. Kat instantly declares war on Coop—to the death; the two fight constantly as Coop tries to stop Kat and tell the world about his possible plans, only to find Kat destroying the evidence, and putting the blame on Coop everytime.

<p>Voiced by <a href="" title="Erin Mathews">Erin Mathews</a></p>
<p>Coop is a 10 (later 11)-year-old boy who thinks Kat is evil since they first met. He tries to stay out of trouble, but is often humiliated and injured when trying to prove Kat&#39;s true identity. He gets blamed for everything Kat ruins in the house. Coop sometimes thinks Mr. Kat&#39;s plan is to take over the world, but Mr. Kat&#39;s plans are to collect Fishy frisky bits and return to his home planet in outer space. Coop may have misunderstood Mr. Kat most of the time. He always jumps to conclusions without knowing all the facts, due to the fact that he never takes chances and never bothers talking to Kat about the situation instead of fighting him. The irony about Coop is that he always comes up with plans to get rid of Kat, which only cause Kat to stay. Coop&#39;s father, Mr. Burtonburger and Coop&#39;s sister Millie think that Coop is insane for thinking that Kat is an evil alien. Dennis (Coop&#39;s best friend), Fiona (Coop&#39;s girlfriend), Grandpa and Grandma believe him. The Burtonburger&#39;s neighbor, Old Lady Munson, hates Coop (and he hates her), but favors Millie. Coop has brown hair, blue eyes and a red T-shirt with an orange stripe. Nobody knows what happened to Coop and Millie&#39;s mom who could either be deceased or divorced.  Together, he and his friends are fans of Captain Blasteroid. In episode &#34;Something about Fiona&#34; Coop develops a crush on Old Lady Munson&#39;s niece named Fiona, who is revealed to also know Mr. Kat&#39;s identity, and also loves Coop back. But during the episode &#34;Kat To The Future Part 2&#34; Coop travels to the past and stops Millie from ever finding Kat. When Coop returns back to the future he found out that Kat&#39;s actual mission was conquering the Earth for other cats and becoming a hero. He remains one of the protagonists throughout the entire series. (<b>Note:</b> Coop&#39;s middle name is David).</p>

<p>Voiced by <a href="" title="Kathleen Barr">Kathleen Barr</a>.</p>
<p>Mr. Kat is the main antagonist of the series. He is a space alien in the form of a <a href="" title="Sphynx (cat)">Sphinx cat</a>. Mr. Kat is an evil alien cat who dislikes Coop. He is adopted by Coop&#39;s sister, Millie, as a stray cat. At first an annoyance to Coop, he soon  becomes a sworn enemy for his being stranded on Earth. They always fight in the comforts of the Burtonburger home, and most often Coop is blamed for any misdeed (At the defense of Millie). However, at times he and Coop get along; in fact whenever trouble threatens both of them they work together, as revealed in &#34;Just Me and Glue.&#34; Kat repeatedly tries to get home, only to be foiled by Coop . In &#34;Nip/Duck&#34; he turns out to be part cyborg. He has many abilities, including squeezing through small gaps, heating body parts to extreme degrees, clinging to walls and ceilings, seeing through things, and shooting beams out of his claws. While annoyed by his &#39;owner&#39; dressing him up, he later grows an attactment to her, to the point of acting like a real pet. In the episode &#34;Pet Peeved&#34;, he constantly calls for Millie&#39;s attention at the start of the episode, then runs away because Millie had found a new playmate. In the episode &#34;One Big, Happy Family,&#34; when Millie falls for a trap Mr. Kat had planted for Coop, Mr. Kat tries to save her, Millie is really the only one he likes. She is Kat&#39;s only friend on Earth as seen when she is in trouble, he always goes to save her like in &#34;The Kat Went Back &#34;. Kat&#39;s main goal is often presented as simply trying to get home, although in one episode, &#34;Fat Kat,&#34; it is revealed that he was sent to Earth to gather &#34;Fishy Frisky Bits,&#34; a type of cat food he had developed an obsessed appetite for, and transport the substance back to his home planet, Kat Nebula, where the promised title of hero would be waiting for him. It is also revealed that he has been doing a poor job of it so far. Another episode, a Christmas special, reveals how much he misses the family he left behind on his home planet. In the episode &#34;Tickled pink&#34; it is revealed that Kat has a weak spot that makes him forget about his mission. In the episode &#34;Kat to the Future Part One and Part Two&#34; Kat build a time machine then Coop uses Kat’s time machine to go back to the past and stop Millie from bringing Kat home, but ends up altering the future for the worse of seen the world had been taken over by Kat. Coop tries to undo the Kat invasion so he has to go back to the past again, which he brought about by fooling with Kat’s time machine. If it was not for Millie, Mr. Kat would have became evil and dominated earth for his own selfishness. In &#34;Rebel with a Claw&#34;, he teams-up with Coop and Dennis to stop Mr. Kitten and return him back to the home planet. Kat also demonstrates holy power of &#34;flying squirrel&#34;.  This is seen in the episode &#34;War versus Hamster&#34;. Coop and Kat often seem to be quite loathing and fighting each other as tendecy, but however, since the beginning of Season 2 to until now, Coop and Kat have slowly begun to move far away from their differences.</p>

<p>Coop&#39;s 8-year old little sister. She is a spoiled and bratty girl and the &#34;owner&#34; of Kat, whom she loves very deeply. Mr. Burtonburger, her father, always does whatever Millie says, mainly because she throws extreme tantrums when she fails to get her way. Because she can easily manipulate people into giving her what she wants, her talent earns her the neighborhood nickname &#34;The Master Manipulator&#34;. Like several characters, she usually blames Coop for everything that happens. Millie has long, dark blue hair tied up in a ponytail with a magenta-colored bow, freckles and buck teeth, and wears red-framed eye-glasses. She is a &#34;Greeny Girl&#34;; the Greeny Girls are a parody of the Girl Scouts. Millie&#39;s hair goes down to her feet. She and Coop rarely get along. In &#34;Tickled Pink&#34;, she and Coop finally got along, though Coop was only doing that to protect from Kat, besides, at the end, they revert back to their old ways. However, in the Kid Vs. Kat episode &#34;Mind Games&#34;, Millie expressed an interest in playing with Coop, at the point where she accidentally gets &#34;telepathic powers&#34; from one of Kat&#39;s inventions, and uses that to force Coop to be with her, even when Coop tried to run away to stop Kat. At the end of the episode her telepathic powers were gone, and both Coop and Kat were relieved, but Millie states sadly that all she wanted was for Coop to play with her. Seeing how sad Millie is, Coop agrees to spend time with her this time, and with a reluctant Kat joining in. Millie is the only person liked by Old Lady Munson. In the episode &#34;The Kat Went Back&#34; Millie understood that Kat was an alien, but later on the same episode, Kat used a gun to brainwash Millie, Lorne, Harley, and Fiona to make them forget that he was an evil alien.</p>

<p>Marc Buhaj, the Senior Vice President of Jetix Europe, said of the program: &#34;We are excited to be part of the <i>Kid vs. Kat</i> adventure with the Studio B team. The series has those quality cartoon elements found in the classics - great music and score, neat characters and crisp slapstick timing. Our main duo of Coop and Kat are set to establish one of the great ongoing cartoon rivalries. One unlucky kid with one freaky, ferocious feline creates absolute mayhem that Jetix kids across Europe will love. I have a feeling that Coop is the one who is going to need a full nine lives just to survive!&#34;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.jetixeurope.com/site/press_office/press_releases/kid_vs_kat.html&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.jetixeurope.com/site/press_office/press_releases/kid_vs_kat.html&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.jetixeurope.com/site/press_office/press_releases/kid_vs_kat.html&#60;/ref&#62;</a></p>
