<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b> Category would only have a handful of articles. All of those current articles are adequately categorized into <a href="" title="category:ferrous alloys">category:ferrous alloys</a>. <a href="" title="User:Wizard191">Wizard191</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wizard191">talk</a>) 23:58, 7 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> per nom as its sole article is in <a href="" title="Category:Ferrous alloys">Category:Ferrous alloys</a>, as is <a href="" title="Cast iron">Cast iron</a>. <a href="" title="User:Occuli">Occuli</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Occuli">talk</a>) 00:31, 8 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> because the category contained at least 5 materials, and more can be created.  The nominator had already deleted the category, then added it back.  <a href="" title="User:Mfields1">Mfields1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mfields1">talk</a>) 01:45, 8 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>The nominator <a href="" title="User:Wizard191">Wizard191</a> already deleted this category without discussion or nomination for deletion on May 30.  The category at that time contained 7 cast irons which I had added to it:</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><a href="" title="Cast iron">Cast iron</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Ductile iron">Ductile iron</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Compacted graphite iron">Compacted graphite iron</a></li>

<li><a href="" title="Malleable iron">Malleable iron</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Gray iron">Gray iron</a></li></ul>

<p>All are distinct cast irons.  Unfortunately, the article <a href="" title="Cast Iron">Cast Iron</a> should not be named as such.  The article attempts to cover the entire family of cast irons.  The opening statement &#34;Cast iron usually refers to grey cast iron...&#34; is itself a bit unencyclopedic.  The article needs work.  For example, the third paragraph states &#34;Cast iron tends to be brittle, except for malleable cast irons&#34; which is patently false.  The family of ductile irons is by definition of its name ductile and not brittle.  The article promotes a stereotype of cast iron that people often associate with the oldest type, gray iron (or greay iron).</p>
<p>Perhaps the title of this category, &#34;Cast iron and its alloys&#34; is not a perfect description but the category should not be deleted as it may be one way for persons refering to Wikipedia to understand the interelationships for this group of alloys or metals.</p>
<p>In addition there are other cast iron types that would be added to this category to complete the category, for articles yet to be written for Wikipedia.</p>
<p>To add the category back, as <a href="" title="User:Wizard191">Wizard191</a> has done, and put only one article in it potrays the category as originally created incorrectly.  <a href="" title="User:Mfields1">Mfields1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mfields1">talk</a>) 02:05, 8 June 2009 (UTC)

<dd>That is exactly what the CFD instructions ask you not to do, because the rest of us need to see them to judge the issue.  Please do not do this again.

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. The alloys of cast iron are all by definition ferrous alloys, and can easily be housed in there. Note - if the decision is to keep, the category will need renaming, as iron is not a proper noun and should have a lower case &#34;i&#34;. <a href="" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i>&#60;small&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#008822&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Grutness">wha?</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/small&#62;</i> 02:12, 8 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>Steels are also ferrous alloys, yet the category <a href="" title="Category:Steels">Category:Steels</a> exists in Wikipedia.  Steels are not cast irons, and cast irons are not steels yet both are ferrous alloys.  <a href="" title="User:Mfields1">Mfields1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mfields1">talk</a>) 23:43, 8 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b>. No harm done with keeping the category as far as I can see, and its presence makes it obvious that the term &#34;cast iron&#34; covers several different materials. &#34;Ferrous alloys&#34; is certainly a very broad category--too broad in my estimation. <a href="" title="User:Paul D. Anderson">Paul D. Anderson</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Paul D. Anderson">talk</a>) 02:19, 11 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b>. Not enough different types of cast iron to clutter up the category structure with a separate cat, see <a href="#Small_with_no_potential_for_growth" title="Wikipedia:Overcategorization">this</a> . Anyway, cast iron <b>is an alloy</b>, so <i>Cast Iron and its alloys</i> is not a good name for anything. If we must have a category then I suggest <i>Cast irons</i> as analogous to <a href="" title="Category:Steels">Category:Steels</a>. Rationalisation of the category structure in this area would seem to be a good idea &#60;small&#62;(as with most areas)&#60;/small&#62;.  <a href="" title="User:Globbet">Globbet</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Globbet">talk</a>) 11:04, 11 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>The term &#39;cast iron&#39; is generic iron alloys which are cast (excluding steel).  Often the term is used in place of grey iron (or gray iron).  The iron alloys I refer to are ones which contain 2.5 to 4.0% Carbon and silicon contents from perhaps 1.0 to 3.0% (though some are higher silicon content).  Their behavior is that to carbon level is much higher than can stay in solution and either during the casting process or a subsequent heat treat the carbon will coalesce into groupings of graphite.  Besides the ones listed above there are Ni-resist (trademark name of Inco) cast irons, Ni-hard irons and others.  The intention is that all these iron alloys (which are cast) be grouped into a category.  They are distinct from other cast alloys but a subset of the ferrous alloys category.  <a href="" title="User:Mfields1">Mfields1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mfields1">talk</a>) 21:39, 14 June 2009 (UTC) </dd></dl>

<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b> <b>Rename</b>.

<dd><b>Comment</b>-- I see there has been no discussion at this point. As further explanation I should point out I created the category originally, and I am now proposing a rename. This is because all scientific theories are &#34;deductive theories&#34; as described in <a href="" title="theory (mathematical logic)">theory (mathematical logic)</a>. That is not what this category is for. These are the various &#34;-isms&#34; within the field of logic and mathematics (the deductive sciences). They are two totally different things, so I recommended this rename for clarification. <a href="" title="User:Gregbard">Pontiff Greg Bard</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gregbard">talk</a>) 19:22, 15 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl><hr/>

<p>Yes, I would say rename the category as <a href="" title="Category:Locomotive designers">Category:Locomotive designers</a>  (and seperated into Fooland locomotive designers, ie entries by nationality). Also incorporate <a href="" title="Category:Locomotive superintendents">Category:Locomotive superintendents</a>, which seems to be an old British term for Chief Mechanical Engineer. And call it locomotive designers not locomotive builders and designers (the builder is either a railway workshop or a separate company, or going down to the shop floor is the machinist!).  </p>
<p>Railway engineers (category) in practice seem to be mechanical engineers, which ignores the contributions of railway civil engineers in surveying and locating and laying track and bridges/tunnels. There does not even seem to be an article on A M Wellington the great railway location engineer!  </p>
<p>Re Rail Transport categories, I have recently made various nationality categories for <a href="" title="Category:People in rail transport">Category:People in rail transport</a>; so that “German people in rail transport” can also link into “Rail transport in Germany” and “German people by occupation”. How about categorising all the entries in “People in rail transport” by nationality so that they link into these country categories also? <a href="" title="User:Hugo999">Hugo999</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hugo999">talk</a>) 09:32, 25 May 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Comments</b> – in the UK the driver of a train is not called a &#39;railway engineer&#39;, so the article <a href="" title="railway engineer">railway engineer</a> does not apply to the UK.

<li>I must admit to being a little confused by the initial comments that &#34;In most English dialects, <a href="" title="railway engineer">railway engineer</a> denotes a person who drives and operates the train, not designs it.&#34; That may be true in the US with railroad engineers, but in my experience the terms locomotive driver or locomotive operator are far more widely used for, erm, locomotive drivers in UK English-speaking countries (including places like Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand), whereas railway engineer tends to be used for the actual engineers. Sir Nigel Gresley was a railway engineer, but that doesn&#39;t mean he drove the trains. Given that we tend to use UK English for non-English speaking countries in Europe on Wikipedia, the above categories are correctly named. I suspect some work is needed both on the title of this category and on an article on railway engineers (which should at least be a disambiguation page rather than a redirect). But even if it was a redirect, this category would still be confusingly named, so the split Vegaswikian suggests is probably a good one. <a href="" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i>&#60;small&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#008822&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Grutness">wha?</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/small&#62;</i> 00:43, 26 May 2009 (UTC)

<li>While it&#39;s true that in the US and Canada, a <a href="" title="railroad engineer">railroad engineer</a> is an engine driver, as far as I know the term <a href="" title="railway engineer">railway engineer</a> is never used there - and that term has a different meaning in the places where it is used. I agree that the category should be renamed and split per Vegaswikian&#39;s suggestion, I&#39;m just pointing out that you&#39;re arguing under a misapprehension if you think that the term &#34;railway engineer&#34; is widely used for a locomotive operator &#34;in most English dialects&#34; - as far as I know, it&#39;s rarely used in any dialects that way. It&#39;s not used that way in the US or Canada (where the word &#34;railroad&#34; is used), and it&#39;s not used that way in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, or just about anywhere else which uses UK English. <a href="" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i>&#60;small&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#008822&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Grutness">wha?</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/small&#62;</i> 00:16, 27 May 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>The <a href="" title="category:Rail transport designers">category:Rail transport designers</a> will have as subcategories “Fooland locomotive designers” ie by nationality and as well as Austrian, British German &#38; Swiss there should be American, Canadian, French and Italian locomotive designers; I suppose there would be someone from each of those countries. Are there engineers to justify a separate category by country for civil/construction/surveying and location engineers? 
The categories for Railway entrepreneurs and perhaps Railway pioneers have only Austrian, German &#38; Swiss subcategories at present; if they are useful categories there should be subcategories for the other countries as well. <a href="" title="User:Hugo999">Hugo999</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hugo999">talk</a>) 23:20, 4 June 2009 (UTC)

This category has major problems, it is just so wrong to have an introduction that points to a lead article while the rest of the introduction says that the lead article does not apply here but here is the inclusion criteria being used. &#60;s&#62;Removing that one subcategory ad rewording the introduction allows for inclusion of individuals who qualify since they did the job defined under the main article.

<li>It must have been the happiest day of your life when I made that LGBT TV episodes category. I would tend to agree that the notion that &#34;a name must be bounded so that it...can fit into one and only one category&#34; is a pretty silly argument, so it&#39;s a darn good thing that <i>no one here has made it</i>. My argument is not that names must be bounded to a single category. My argument is that names <i>cannot</i> be bounded by such characteristics as nationality or religion or ethnicity or descent. My surname (which happens to be of Hebrew derivation) is borne by people of dozens if not hundreds of different races, religions, nationalities, ethnicities, <i>ad infinitum</i>. There is nothing preventing any surname from ending up in every single &#34;Fooian surnames&#34; category based on there being a handful of Fooian people or even a single Fooian person that&#39;s named it. What does this categorization scheme tell us about a name, when the same name can potentially be categorized in all of them?

<li>The day I was married and the birth of my children rank a bit higher, but I do mark both LGBT-related CfD days on my calendar though I don&#39;t celebrate the day the category as created, yet. It still surprises me that Hallmark does not make cards to mark the occasion. The clear and compelling community decisions at CfD regarding <a href="" title="Category:LGBT-related television episodes">Category:LGBT-related television episodes</a> demonstrate several different precedents that I strongly agree with and that should be applied in all cases, not just for one narrow category that you support, and  it provides a wonderful example that I will always think of in the unlikely event that we are not on the same side of an argument as we were with the <a href="" title="Category:LGBT-related television episodes">Category:LGBT-related television episodes</a>. A television episode can possibly belong to hundreds of different categories, and the fact that a single episode could be LGBT-related and also fit into to dozens of other categories provides no basis for eliminating the <a href="" title="Category:LGBT-related television episodes">Category:LGBT-related television episodes</a> on that basis. There are thousands of awards and honors that we categorize and it is possible that one individual can win dozens or hundreds of them, a possibility that also does not bother me and that would be a poor justification for elimination of all award categories. Names are used in different societies and cultures, and showing that through categories is exactly what we want to do. I don&#39;t believe that every surname should be categorized based on a single individual with the name in any one society, religion, culture or nation. As always, the standard is reliable and verifiable sources showing that a surname is connected with a given society, religion, culture or nation. My surname is used in both Jewish and Korean cultures, but I would be far better able to show the name as Korean and would categorize it there, and would be unable to show reliable and verifiable sources documenting the surname as Jewish and would not categorize it there, as is the case already. One person (or even two) does not make it worth a category, but reliable sources do. That&#39;s how Wikipedia works. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 17:46, 8 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>It is highly unlikely that an episode of a television series could reasonably belong to hundreds of valid categories; I would be surprised if we even had hundreds of episode categories (other than by series). The awards analogy is not valid, because an award does not become another award on the basis of another person winning it. A name associated with one nationality/culture/whatever <i>does</i> become a name of another nationality/culture/whatever on the basis of another person having it. &#34;Connected to&#34; is a very vague inclusion standard. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 18:47, 8 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

To nominate this category for deletion is moronic and was likely done only to incite. First off, the topic of <a href="" title="onomastics">onomastics</a> is of course very old, extensive, notable, and encyclopedic. Secondly, the study of Jewish onomastics is likely even more extensive and better researched than that of other groups, nations, or peoples. The following list of primary sources on the topic of Jewish onomastics clearly indicates that this subject is indeed very encyclopedic and thus to delete this category (along with any other surname categories) would be utterly absurd and would only further decimate Wikipedia&#39;s categorical backbone:</li>

<li>While I think that the claim of censorship is unfounded, the problem of deciding that nearly a dozen reliable and verifiable published sources that cover the subject are not enough is evidence of a far bigger problem. There is simply no way to provide evidence that will incontrovertibly meet a standard that justifies retention of any category when the counter-argument that is offered amounts to &#34;is not&#34;. It can hardly be any clearer that the category is defining, and the argument that sources only prove that it&#39;s notable is a standard argument used to wave off strong evidence of definingness. All we are left with is a game of do you like the category or not as sources mean little, if anything, in the world of CfD. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 03:24, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>

BTW, <a href="" title="Campbell (surname)">Campbell (surname)</a> is ultimately <i>Gaelic</i>, not Scots. And see, the thing is, since there are any number of people in any number of countries, cultures, religions, tribes, societies, whatever who have these various names, so if the names are restricted arbitrarily then we&#39;re providing inaccurate information. If we categorize the names by every country, culture, etc. then the huge numbers of categories make the categories themselves meaningless. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 21:09, 14 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

You&#39;re tangling two things, religion and linguistic origin. These names are Hebrew in origin, regardless of who &#39;wears&#39; them today. And the term &#34;Christian names&#34; is another red herring - these are Christian names that are Hebrew in origin, as you mean &#34;Christian&#34; to equal &#34;first&#34;. Finally, please note this is not about <i>Jewish</i> first names, but <i>Hebrew</i> ones.

<dd>I wasn&#39;t trying to be condescending, I was trying to understand your opinion for delete, which is bemusing. If I am called Jean-Pierre and live in China, regardless of which alphabet my name is written in, and no matter how badly the locals might mangle my name, it&#39;s still a French name. If you have difficulty with the name of the Cat, that&#39;s not a reason for deletion, it&#39;s a reason to propose a name change. I struggle to understand on what grounds you&#39;re proposing deletion, as it&#39;s clear that a defined group of names can be said, using RS, to originate in a specific language, that being Hebrew. Incidentally, many Hebrew names do not derive from the bible, or even any other form of Hebrew literature. --<a href="" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dweller">talk</a>) 12:31, 8 June 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>I stay with my keep, but would like to reply to a few commetns above. Since &#34;D&#39;Alembert&#34; is a name in French, it is a &#34;French&#34; name (where the word &#34;French&#34; is refering to the language, not the country, just as &#34;Hebrew&#34; is a language). Denying this is illogical. Likewise, there is no reason to call these name &#34;Christian&#34; <i>instead of</i> &#34;Hebrew&#34;, because these two things are not mutually exclusive. They <i>are</i> Hebrew names.

<li>I don&#39;t know that I bother replying, but according to at least one biographical source, &#34;D&#39;Alembert&#34; is a self-name made up by a famous Frenchman, previously known as &#34;Jean-Baptiste Daremberg&#34; (a Dutch name?), prior to that known as &#34;Jean Le Rond&#34; (given at the orphanage). It is similar to a variety of Spanish-derived names, so perhaps he read it in a book. Does that make it French? Originally Spanish? What about the Floridian Creole variant of the same era?

<li>Well, if you inadvertently place an alumnus in <a href="" title="Category:University of Missouri-Columbia alumni">Category:University of Missouri-Columbia alumni</a> (which I said was a redirect), a friendly bot comes along and carefully transfers him to the correct category. So the problem (using HotCat) is not obvious to me. What about the fact that the article names and the category names will no longer match, in a way that might well mystify those who, while unable to produce an en-dash via a keyboard combination or a one-click wiki-edit, can manage cut-and-paste with complete aplomb, and use it happily and effortlessly with such categories as <a href="" title="Category:Gençlerbirliği S.K.">Category:Gençlerbirliği S.K.</a>?

<li><b>Keep</b> I despise these non-keyboard characters and I wish that every article and title only included what I have available on my English-language keyboard. While I have supported the renaming of such categories to use a keyboard-available character in the past, the priority should be matching the article title. If the article folks decide with far broader consensus that the title needs an en-dash, we should respect that. Whether using HotCat or the Wikipedia insert template on every edit page or cutting and pasting from a mention of the article title in the article in question, we should have the technology and willingness to deal with this &#34;problem&#34;. There are innumerable thousands of articles with en-dashes and other special characters and we should start consistently conforming to article titles unless there is a truly exceptional situation that I cannot imagine. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 20:42, 19 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Far too often, the flea at the end the tail of CfD starts trying to wag the Wikipedia dog. I would love to see the English-language Wikipedia restrict all articles to including only those characters that I can type with a single keystroke on my keyboard. I hate these special characters, especially in article titles. Unless we want to grant ourselves a special exemption from how the rest of Wikipedia works, which includes the use of special characters, such as en-dashes, we should make a rather simple standard of using the article title in categories. The priority should be ease of usage and navigation, but the decisions on article titles are not made here at CfD and there is absolutely no reason for why we should be different here. Expecting people to hold down multiple keys to generate a specialty character appears to be absolutely no barrier to ease of usage and navigation in article space, and there is no evidence that readers are unable to find the article for these schools due to their inability to type an en-dash on their keyboard, yet we expect those reading and creating articles to use these untypable characters. I have even been forced to hold down multiple keys to generate <a href="" title="Capital letter">CAPITAL LETTERS</a>, yet every category has at least one in their name, despite the need to hold down multiple keys in order to generate the character. Let&#39;s start to learn how to live by the rules set for Wikipedia, without overriding them here. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 05:25, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

The capital letter argument is entirely specious because the search box is not reliant on capitalization. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 17:35, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>We are free to make decisions here about categories, many of which have been in direct conflict with broader consensus set with far broader participation in the article world. While we here at CfD often firmly believe that the world revolves around categories, alas it does not. We can reduce the needless disruption caused by conflicting &#34;consensus&#34; set at CfD that blatantly disregards the genuine consensus set in article space or we can start learning to cooperate by following the simple standard of using the same titles for categories that are used for the corresponding articles, even when the overwhelming burden of cutting and pasting special characters appears too overwhelming. As with the example cited above regarding <a href="" title="Category:Gençlerbirliği S.K.">Category:Gençlerbirliği S.K.</a>, we could demand that we use keyboard characters and name it <a href="" title="Category:Genclerbirligi S.K.">Category:Genclerbirligi S.K.</a>, but all we would accomplish is pointless disruption to Wikipedia.  <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 19:23, 21 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>What you call &#34;artificial and arbitrary dashes that are dictated by <a href="" title="WP:DASH">WP:DASH</a>&#34; are the result of consensus reached and accepted by a far broader consensus than the usual suspects here at CfD and we ought to start biting the bullet and learning to respect that. It&#39;s the artificial and arbitrary standards that are set at CfD that are far less worthy of consideration. I still have no interest in warring, but if you can follow this back to the beginning you will notice that I voted and you felt the need to tell me why I&#39;m wrong.

<li>I frequently tell other editors when I believe their rationale in a discussion is incorrect, so there&#39;s nothing special about you other than perhaps the number of times that you express opinions with which I disagree. Consensus has developed at CFD that using non-standard characters in category names is a barrier to navigation and your denigration of that consensus by demeaning those who helped develop it is disheartening. Your participation in CFD has certainly pegged you as one of the &#34;usual suspects&#34; so your continued belittling of those who participate here is bewildering. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 16:49, 28 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>I hate these endashes, both in articles and especially in titles, and I fail to see any benefit from having dashes of different lengths. It&#39;s a pointless waste of time and conceit that adds nothing to the encyclopedia. But it is the consensus reached in the real world of Wikipedia, the one where we write articles. I disagree with this policy, and would vote to overturn when it comes up again. But until then, I use endashes where policy prescribes their use to the best of my ability, such as between dates and in article titles between &#34;University of Missouri&#34; and &#34;Kansas City&#34;. Maintaining that the CfD flea at the end of the Wikipedia dog should be waving overall policy only serves to disrupt rather to improve Wikipedia, and &#34;consensus&#34; reached at CfD has no value whatsoever if it is in direct conflict with broader Wikipedia policy. Your belief that you can ignore what you call &#34;artificial and arbitrary dashes that are dictated by <a href="" title="WP:DASH">WP:DASH</a>&#34; is just part of the pattern of blatant disregard of many other broader policies here and just more evidence of the thorough cleaning and disinfection needed at CfD. Rather than simply insist that I&#39;m wrong, why not try to explain why Wikipedia consensus at <a href="" title="WP:DASH">WP:DASH</a> should be ignored, despite the clear disruption of conflicting policies. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 02:32, 30 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li><a href="" title="WP:DASH">WP:DASH</a> is not policy. It is a guideline. It is subject to exceptions. One of the exceptions to that guideline that has developed through numerous discussions here is that the use of non-standard characters in category names is a barrier to navigation. You usually harp to no end about navigational utility so your insistence on enforcing a &#34;rule&#34; that impedes navigation is just flat-out bizarre. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 05:21, 2 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Guideline or policy, the &#34;bizarre&#34; insistence that dashes of various size is a barrier to navigation in categories is conclusively disproved by the fact that there is no such obstacle in the real world of articles. I&#39;ve seen real people (i.e. non-editors) use categories, and they always do so by clicking on the category to see the other entries, jumping from category to category one click at a time, never by typing in a name. No real world reader of Wikipedia will ever have to type the name of a category, let alone have to worry about which size dash to use. The only people who type category names in full are folks who are editing articles, and we know full well that some article titles have those funny dashes in them, in addition to all those other funny characters I can&#39;t type on my keyboard and despise as much as you do. The same way that any editor would use the endash in an article to link to someone who attended the <a href="" title="University of Missouri–Kansas City">University of Missouri–Kansas City</a>, they would use the exact same title when they add <a href="" title="Category:University of Missouri–Kansas City alumni">Category:University of Missouri–Kansas City alumni</a> to the bottom of the article, using endashes in both places, a task made even more trivial if using <a href="" title="User:TheDJ/HotCat">HotCat</a>. The navigational ability I &#34;harp to no end&#34; about is most often expressed as having category titles match those of their parent articles, and that is exactly what we should be doing here on a consistent basis. There is absolutely no barrier to navigation here; All we have are inconsistent standards, where some folks at CfD will not comply with clear consensus set at a broader basis at <a href="" title="WP:DASH">WP:DASH</a> and elsewhere. Where these two standards conflict, the one established in the real world of article space should be used. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 17:10, 2 July 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>Wikipedia is not a <a href="" title="WP:DIRECTORY">WP:DIRECTORY</a>. I see this scheme as a library. There are thousands and thousands of articles on WP about books and authors. There should not be a category for every single author that has a book. Many, many of those author cats have only one member even. Sure, author is integral into about a book, but that doesn&#39;t mean there has to be a category for it, especially when there&#39;s already templates and links. &#60;font color=&#34;#1EC112&#34; size=&#34;3px&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Reywas92">Reywas92</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#45E03A&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Reywas92"><b>Talk</b></a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 16:56, 7 June 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>
