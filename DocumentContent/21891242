<p>The story revolves around Kio Kakazu. A <a href="" title="catgirl">girl with cat ears</a> appears before him during a memorial service for one of his family ancestors. The girl calls herself Eris and claims she is an alien. Before long, fanatical alien worshipers and a mysterious government agency are in hot pursuit of Eris, but Kio&#39;s childhood friend Manami—who wants to follow in her father&#39;s footsteps in the CIA—captures Eris. Kio finds himself having to protect Eris from everyone.</p>

<dl>
<dt> </dt>
<dd> &#60;ref name=&#34;funicast&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</dd>
<dd>A kindhearted, yet sophisticated teenage boy. Kio is easily able to accept the proof that his new friend is an alien, and that both his other friends are secret agents. He knows how to handle firearms, though he is not sure what business his Uncle Yuichi is in to have them. He displays a strong sense of justice, and is willing to take action when he feels it is needed. This sense, and his treatment of others, draws the attention of his female friends. He is unsure about his reaction to all that interest, and their attention begins to cause complications for Kio. Eris the Catian in particular has decided that she wishes to be his mate as she is about to come into her first heat. In the final episode of the anime, he temporarily becomes a catboy.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dt> </dt>
<dd> &#60;ref name=&#34;funicast&#34;/&#62;</dd>
<dd>A 16-year-old scout for the Catian people exploring Earth. Tall and well endowed, she has easily befriended many people, and regular cats she has met on Earth. Initially most do not believe her to be an alien, but she shows Kio the proof directly with her technology, ears and tail. While she is learning the ways of Earth, she is also a competent fighter who employs strategies and technologies not seen on Earth. Her interactions with Kio are closer and more emotional, potentially due to the fact she is 16 and about to enter her first heat. With the kindness and interest he has shown, she has selected him as a mate. Eris was forced to take chemicals to end her first heat prematurally as it was causing disruption to her duties as an ambassador and representative of Catians on Earth, with high expectations for her second heat and another chance to mate with Kio. She develops feelings for Kio after she found out he risked his life to save her when she was captured. When Aoi admitted that she was jealous of her closeness to Kio, she finally kisses him on the last episode, after Eris reveals due to Catian law they could all be Kio&#39;s lovers, she did not bear any ill will towards her and is happy that somebody else shares the same feelings as she does.</dd></dl>

<dd> &#60;ref name=&#34;funicast&#34;/&#62;</dd>
<dd>A teenage girl who worked for the Immigration Bureau of Japan as one of their top agents before helping save Eris. She is now seen as a traitor so she lives at the Catian Embassy under its <a href="" title="diplomatic immunity">diplomatic immunity</a>. She has the ability to teleport objects to her that lie within a 50m radius. Because of this ability her parents threw her out, leaving her to grow up on as she states is &#34;the other side of society&#34;. She also makes use of a technologically advanced battlesuit and weaponry, (unknowingly provided by the Dogisians). She has a noticeable crush on Kio due to the fact he is the only person who ever treated her like a normal girl, but feels he would not like her due to her ability and is too shy to attempt any of the ideas Manami suggest to &#34;get him&#34; (such as suggesting pushing him to the ground and giving him a big kiss). In the anime, she drives a blue <a href="" title="Ford Shelby GT500">Ford Shelby GT500</a> equipped with hidden gadgets such as a smokescreen and capture net. Due to Manami&#39;s suggestion, she changes her way of addressing Kio, from &#34;Kakazu-kun&#34; to &#34;Kio-kun&#34; (which in Japan signifies that one is close to a person). She finally kisses him on the last episode, after Eris reveals due to Catian law they could all be Kio&#39;s lovers.</dd></dl>

<dd>A <a href="" title="tomboy">tomboy</a>, childhood friend, and next door neighbor of Kio. Since she was young she wanted to join the CIA, where her room is filled with listening equipment and guns. She was in the CIA recruitment program operating under the supervisor codenamed JACK, but believes she is no longer a candidate after helping rescue Eris. She also lives at the Catian Embassy under its diplomatic immunity. She has feelings for Kio, but believes he sees her as just one of the guys and that she &#34;let her chance slip by&#34;, so she roots for Aoi to get him before &#34;that alien steals him away&#34;. She wears a watch with a noticeable scratch on it, which it got the day she realized she was in love with Kio; she will often rub the scratch when nervous. She has a noticeable fascination with guns, to the point where Kio refers to her as a gun <a href="" title="otaku">otaku</a>. She is often very pushy when it comes to helping Aoi make progress with her relationship with Kio, because she does not wish to see Aoi&#39;s chance to slip by as she believes hers has. She finally kisses him on the last episode, after Eris reveals due to Catian law they could all be Kio&#39;s lovers.</dd></dl>

<dd>Kio&#39;s teacher and leader of Beautiful Contact Japan Sect. Due to the fact Eris doesn&#39;t represent the stereotypical alien (tentacles, green skin, etc), she firmly believes that Eris, despite the obvious, is not really an alien. Even after the public meeting between the Earth and the Catians, Maki still holds to her beliefs that aliens are supposed to look like those found in movies, manga and other sci-fi media.</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt>Assist-A-Roids</dt></dl>

<p>Small, anthropomorphic robots used by both the Catians and the Dogisians. The Catian versions are considered more advanced with their own self-repair systems, while the Dogisian assist-a-roids must steal electronic equipment to repair themselves. With the exception of Muttley, the Dogisian assist-a-roids are considered expendable. The Catian assist-a-roids can be personalized to suit their owners. Kio is given an assist-a-roid named Sayada that is modeled after a movie director. Aoi is given a pair named Chiba-chan and Kin-chan that resemble samurai, while Manami has a gun-wielding, gangster-looking one named Yu-Fat, a nod to Hong Kong Action Movie Star Chow Yun Fat.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Factions">Factions</span></h2>

<dl>
<dt> </dt>
<dd>An alien race. They look and speak just like humans, except they have cat ears and tails. They currently are using Kio&#39;s house as their Embassy. Due to their society reaching its apex 70,000 years ago, (having done everything possible on their planet), they interact with other species for new experiences. Since males of their race are exceedingly rare, Catian Law does allow for polygamous couplings. Catians go into periods of extreme sexual behavior or mating seasons, with their first time at age 16. Normally they have stimulus devices to satisfy their desire to procreate, though Eris wishes to have Kio as her mate.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dt> </dt>
<dd>Another alien race similar to the Catians, except they have dog ears and tails. They seem to be bitter enemies, similar to a relationship of a cat and dog. They had arrived on Earth a while before the Catians, but kept their arrival in secret and made connections with the various military organizations, including Japan. Their main goal is to prevent any collaborations between Earth and the Catians, as they would lose control. Furthermore, due to a total embargo placed on their planet to interact with other species, they are technically not supposed to be on Earth and are illegally trading advanced weaponry.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dt> </dt>
<dd>A highly evolved society of aliens that compose the Universal Regulations Government. They are considered extremely powerful and oversee the interactions between other races. They forbid attempts at conquest and have placed an embargo on Dogisia, thereby preventing them from making any public contact with other species.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dt>Beautiful Contact</dt>
<dd>They are a terrorist group dedicated to the welcoming of the first intergalactic species to Earth. However, they are also very particular of who they wish the aliens to look like, where when they saw Eris felt like she would be unacceptable for the human race to be their first encounter and planned to get rid of her before her presence became public knowledge. Maki is the leader of the Japanese sect. With the Catians later making public interactions and peace treaty negotiations with the Japanese Government, the group&#39;s main goals are no longer valid.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dt>Intelligence Agencies</dt>
<dd>Some of the US intelligence agencies are represented in the series, including the <a href="" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a>, <a href="" title="Defense Intelligence Agency">DIA</a>. Manami aspires to join the CIA.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dt> </dt>
<dd>A large, nearly worldwide cult dedicated to worshiping <a href="" title="catgirls">cat ears</a> and cat tails. It is led by Antonia. They considered Eris to be their Savior and Goddess. By the eighth episode, Eris and Antonia began work to slowly wipe out the religious aspects and turn the group into more of a <a href="" title="fan club">fan club</a>. The people of Dogisia are against this organization due to their relationship with Catia and the fact that they represent a huge financial asset.</dd></dl>
