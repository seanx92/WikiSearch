<li><b>Keep</b>. As opposed to what? If this is to distinguish it from the city, the &#34;District&#34; already does that. Any upper municipalities or districts on Ontario with &#34;, Ontario&#34; in their names should have the &#34;, Ontario&#34; removed unless there are similar named counties or districts elsewhere. <b><a href="" title="User:Vidioman">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#4B95B5&#34;&#62;vıd&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Vidioman">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#CC5500&#34;&#62;ıoman&#60;/span&#62;</a></b> 13:07, 23 January 2009 (UTC)

<li><i>Should</i>—perhaps. But who&#39;s going to nominate them for renaming? I could support a rename of them if someone nominated them, but unless there&#39;s some commitment from someone to do so, I can&#39;t understand the rationale for having one category remain inconsistent. It makes the system look scattershot and junky (&#60;s&#62;kind of like Thunder Bay....&#60;/s&#62; I MEAN....)

<dd><i>The result of the discussion was:</i>  <b>rename.

<dd><b>Propose renaming</b> <a href="" title="Category:Imperial Russia">Category:Imperial Russia</a> to <a href="" title="Category:Russian Empire">Category:Russian Empire</a>.</dd>
<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b>  The main article (<a href="" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>) used to be titled &#34;Imperial Russia&#34; at the time this category was created.  While the article was later renamed, the category had not been.  This CfD aims to fix that.  The vast majority of this cat&#39;s subcats and articles already use &#34;Russian Empire&#34;.—<a href="" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#38;nbsp;•&#38;nbsp;(<a href="" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 22:24, January&#38;nbsp;22, 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><b>rename</b> per nom.  There is no reason why this category should be named differently than the main article.  Also matches most of its subcats.  Those that do not match also need to be re-named <a href="" title="User:Hmains">Hmains</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hmains">talk</a>) 03:03, 23 January 2009 (UTC)</li>

<dl>
<dd>But what would be the point?  &#34;Empire of Russia&#34; is not nearly as common a term as &#34;Russian Empire&#34;, not to mention that the latter is a more accurate translation of &#34; &#34;.—<a href="" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#38;nbsp;•&#38;nbsp;(<a href="" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 15:12, January&#38;nbsp;23, 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></li>

<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b> There&#39;s no need to pre-emptively disambiguate. The only reason album categories are ever disambiguated like this is when there are numerous bands of the same name, or when it may be otherwise confusing (country names, etc). However, I doubt any of the other Dark Angels will be releasing albums. <a href="" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:J Milburn">talk</a>) 19:48, 22 January 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. Right now the name matches the article for the band <a href="" title="Dark Angel (band)">Dark Angel (band)</a>, which is probably the reason the disambiguated name was used in the category name. Also, there is an individual album (<a href="" title="Dark Angel (album)">Dark Angel (album)</a>) of the same name by a different artist, so technically there could be confusion that the proposed name is for albums named <i>Dark Angel</i>. A bit of a stretch, but all things considered, I think keeping the DAB would be appropriate. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 00:33, 23 January 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - &#34;Dark Angel&#34; with no dab lends itself to ambiguity. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 01:12, 28 January 2009 (UTC)</li>

I have read all the previous noms, and discussion was centred on the name of the main article in every case. Now there appears to be a shred of consensus about it.

<li><b>Merge</b> into equivalent categories for &#34;Province of Bolzano-Bozen&#34;, leaving the old forms as category redirects.

<li><b>Strong keep</b>: I agree that the present multitude of categories lefts wanting, and, unlike earlier nominations by other users, I can see that this one was done in good faith. But it should be remembered that the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Province_of_Bolzano-Bozen/Archive_3#Page_Split" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Province_of_Bolzano-Bozen/Archive_3#Page_Split">2007 decision to switch from &#34;South Tyrol&#34; to &#34;Province of Bolzano-Bozen&#34; was a close-run thing</a>. South Tyrol is definitely still a common name in English (I am just reading a peer-reviewed scientific US article which does not even bother with the Fascist invention Alto Adige or the administrative &#34;Province of Bolzano-Bozen&#34;, which means nothing to most English speakers). And many official documents from South Tyrol/Alto Adige feature that name prominently: Oscar Benvenuto (ed.): <a class="externallink" href="http://www.provinz.bz.it/Astat/downloads/Siz_2008-eng.pdf" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.provinz.bz.it/Astat/downloads/Siz_2008-eng.pdf">&#34;South Tyrol in Figures 2008&#34;, Provincial Statistics Institute of the Autonomous Province of South Tyrol</a>,  Bozen/Bolzano 2007. Still, we may ultimately settle on something like Südtirol/Alto Adige, if there exists consensus, but for now I just don&#39;t see it happen.

<dd>Sorry, but you are <b>wrong</b> :)   Alto Adige is &#60;u&#62;not&#60;/u&#62; a &#34;fascist invention&#34;, and all you do is misunderstand something which is much more complex. :)  The term Alto Adige has been around for centuries, just as Alto Po, Alto Ticino, etc.  It is used in the Ladin language that predates both German and Italian (Tuscan) in the region.  The French applied this name <i>Haut-Adige</i> as a political term in the 19th century.  The fascists abused this term during their reign, just as Berlusconi abused &#34;Forza Italia&#34;.  Silvio didn&#39;t invent this term anymore than the fascists invented Alto Adige. :) So, just trivializing this name as a fascist invention is actually ridiculous, and can certainly be offensive culturally.  South Tyrol itself is an invention of only the 20th century, as there was never a &#34;South Tyrol&#34; in previous history; there was only the County of Tyrol.  Next, you are making grand assumptions and statements to say what the US scientific community chooses to use or doesn&#39;t -- <b>and</b> why -- from reading one article.  I&#39;ve witnessed much more often the use of Alto Adige in daily English, simply because in the United States (and other English-speaking countries) the products we most associate with this region are <i>Wines from Alto Adige</i>. :)  Even the German wineries use your infamous Alto Adige -- go figure. ^_-  There were obvious reasons to locate the page at Province of BZ, because it matches up with all the other provinces of Italy pages on Wikipedia.   Trying to switch it to Südtirol/Alto Adige will smack again of bias, because it doesn&#39;t even match the name used in the constitution for the overall region <i>Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol</i> -- unless you think we do some service to the population by simply placing German first.....  <a href="" title="User:Icsunonove">Icsunonove</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Icsunonove">talk</a>) 05:51, 23 January 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></li></ul>

<dd>Yeah, that is really nice of you to come here, sneak a few jibes at other editors along the way.  :)   You are not aware that at one point there was no balance what-so-ever in these articles and they were heavily biased towards a German POV; or is that preferable to you?   You know you are really out of line coming after me or Supparluca or anyone else that helped pound out the agreement that now uses multilingual titles.   At one point the articles were Trentino-South Tyrol and just South Tyrol, even though in English most often we say Trentino-Alto Adige for this region.  Would you like it this way instead, to remove the German all together?  The usage between Alto Adige and South Tyrol is split 50/50, and what you state above is nonsense.  For the name of the province in English it is usually simply Province of Bolzano; just like Province of Milan, Province of Venice, etc.   We could of easily pushed for those Italian-only names, but we did not.  So are we anti-German or anti-Italian?  Both?  Neighter?  @_@   We purposely went for multilingual names that had a basis in the constitution and Brittanica; and that solution indeed had large acceptance.  So, why don&#39;t you give a little bit of credit before throwing your stones on here; something you&#39;ve done from the get go.  :( <a href="" title="User:Icsunonove">Icsunonove</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Icsunonove">talk</a>) 05:55, 23 January 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Keep</b> - on this occasion, mostly because this looks like a badly-thought-out attempt to force the issue, which comes with a huge amount of baggage, and therefore needs to be treated cautiously and correctly. There are procedures, which the nominator has ignored for no good reason. If someone (else) will address the question properly on another occasion perhaps we can resolve it.

<dd>Just to be clear, the words used in the title aren&#39;t what&#39;s important. The content of those articles that use the term &#34;inaugural address&#34; isn&#39;t radically different from the content of the articles that use &#34;inauguration&#34;. The real issue is the presence of substantial content about the address itself, which is what justifies their inclusion in the category. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 00:28, 23 January 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>There&#39;s another point that&#39;s being overlooked: this category is also a sub-cat of  , making it part of the category tree for speeches by heads of state. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 00:34, 23 January 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Keep</b> Without getting into too long a debate, I think from the number of published resources available (not to mention all the newspapers that reported at the time), inaugurations as an event are all notable and will have articles eventually.  Most of them the speeches could easily be covered in-article, but some (Lincoln, FDR, Kennedy, etc) have significant scholarship on the speeches themselves, and thus could legitimately have articles separate from the inaugural event.  Thus I don&#39;t think it would hurt to keep the speech cat for those exceptions. <a href="" title="User:Joshdboz">Joshdboz</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Joshdboz">talk</a>) 20:11, 22 January 2009 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> &#38;mdash;  I apologize for the confusion I caused by gratuitously and recklessly adding the inaugural address category to the inauguration stubs I created.  I think I&#39;ve got it fixed now.  All articles in <a href="" title="Category:United States presidential inaugural addresses">Category:United States presidential inaugural addresses</a> now directly deal with an inaugural address.  There are three inauguration articles that I left in since the address is discussed directly in the inauguration aritlce&#38;mdash;Washington, Roosevelt, and Reagan. <a href="" title="Category:United States presidential inaugurations">Category:United States presidential inaugurations</a> now contains all the inauguration articles. &#60;b style=&#34;border:1px solid #080; font-size:0.9em;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:LinguistAtLarge">LinguistAtLarge</a> &#38;bull; <a href="" title="User talk:LinguistAtLarge">Msg</a>&#38;nbsp;&#60;/b&#62; 06:07, 23 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Withdrawing nomination</b> (if I can do that) &#38;mdash; per above arguments and the fact that there is a distinct difference between an inauguration article and an inaugural address article.  When I proposed this, I had the mistaken idea that both an inauguration and its address should be conflated into one. &#60;b style=&#34;border:1px solid #080; font-size:0.9em;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:LinguistAtLarge">LinguistAtLarge</a> &#38;bull; <a href="" title="User talk:LinguistAtLarge">Msg</a>&#38;nbsp;&#60;/b&#62; 06:07, 23 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul><hr/>

<dd>Thanks for that link Good Olfactory.  I didn&#39;t realize there had been a previous discussion, and I had only seen a few other presidential administration categories, and they were all capitalized.  After reading the other discussion, I don&#39;t have a strong opinion either way (whether &#34;administration&#34; should be upper or lower case), but I would prefer if it were consistent. &#60;b style=&#34;border:1px solid #080; font-size:0.9em;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User:LinguistAtLarge">LinguistAtLarge</a> &#38;bull; <a href="" title="User talk:LinguistAtLarge">Msg</a>&#38;nbsp;&#60;/b&#62; 07:56, 22 January 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I agree with the desire for consistency. After the previous discussion, I&#39;m a bit unsure what is appropriate. I suppose if it&#39;s a coin toss, I can go with either for the sake of consistency. I can support the nom. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 08:34, 22 January 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Rename both</b> - May as well decide both together, so I just added  . This makes it clear that it&#39;s referring to &#34;personnel of the Eisenhower Administration&#34; and not &#34;administration personnel of Eisenhower&#34; (whatever that might be). <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 10:05, 22 January 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose both</b> This is an issue that should not be dealt with one president at a time. <a href="" title="Category:United States Presidential administrations">Category:United States Presidential administrations</a> has 19 categories for Presidential administrations, 12 of which use the lower case &#34;a&#34; while 7 use the capital &#34;A&#34;. This inconsistency is rather consistent, leaving us with <a href="" title="Category:George H. W. Bush administration">Category:George H. W. Bush administration</a> and <a href="" title="Category:George W. Bush Administration">Category:George W. Bush Administration</a>. We have heard here and before that there appears to be no consistent grammatical rule that requires capitalization or non-capitalization. Any decision here should be on a global basis for all presidents and not based on arbitrary educated guesses for this one category alone. I do agree that we should be consistent, and at this point the majority of these categories do not have the &#34;a&#34; capitalized. I thus oppose this nomination and encourage that the 7 upper-case administration categories be changed to lower case to match the most consistent rule being followed here. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 15:39, 22 January 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> &#38;mdash; I agree with a desire for consistency, and I an neutral on the use of &#34;a&#34; or &#34;A&#34;. What would be the best way to proceed from here?

<ul>
<li>You could add the other lower-case &#34;a&#34; categories to this nomination so they can be discussed together. Or you could withdraw and start a new nomination afresh with all of them included. That might be the simplest way for clarity purposes, and it would ensure a full-5 day discussion for all of them. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 21:50, 23 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<dd>Comment: Believe it or not but they are two distinct groups actually. &#34;Canadian-West Indian&#34; is more historic and slightly more popular...  See Google: &#34;Canadian-Caribbean&#34; has 42,600 hits vs. &#34;Canadian-West Indian&#34; which has 68,200 hits. Canadian West Indian covers Caribbean region plus Bahamas + Guyana + Belize for example which are considered &#34;West Indians&#34; as well due to similar culture.  However the term &#34;West Indian&#34; tends to exclude non-English speaking nations. E.g. Dominican Republic, Cuba etc. See StatsCanada.  <a class="externallink" href="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-621-x/89-621-x2007007-eng.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/89-621-x/89-621-x2007007-eng.htm">where 12% regarded themselves as just &#34;West Indian&#34; born</a>.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd><b>Suggest merging</b> <a href="" title="Category:Holocaust survivors">Category:Holocaust survivors</a> to <a href="" title="Category:Nazi concentration camp survivors">Category:Nazi concentration camp survivors</a></dd>
<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b> <b>Merge</b>. The &#34;Holocaust survivors&#34; category was just created; the target category has been around for a long time now. I prefer the target category, since it is appropriately both more specific and more general. Appropriately more specific: because any Jew who lived in Europe during the Nazi-era could technically call themself a &#34;Holocaust survivor&#34;, but I think what is worth categorizing is people who survived being in a Nazi concentration camp, not just being a Jew in 1930s/1940s Europe who managed to survive World War II. Appropriately more general: because the target category can obviously apply to non-Jews who were in the camps, whereas the &#34;Holocaust&#34; usually is in reference only to Jewish victims. Directly on point is <a href="#Category:Nazi_concentration_camp_survivors_to_Category:Survivors_of_the_Holocaust" title="Wikipedia:Categories_for_deletion/Log/2006_May_24">this 2006 CfD</a>, where it was decided against renaming the target category to <a href="" title="Category:Survivors of the Holocaust">Category:Survivors of the Holocaust</a>.

<ul>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b> Appropriate wording needs to be crafted to describe the inclusion criteria. Again, in the usual zeal to delete a category that is a strong defining characteristic, we have a repulsive and sickening excuse for deletion that trivializes the experiences of those who apparently want to call themselves &#34;Holocaust survivors&#34; on a technicality but are somehow cheating because they weren&#39;t in an official Nazi concentration camp while they lived in day-to-day fear of being hunted down like dogs by the Nazis. <a href="" title="List of Holocaust survivors">List of Holocaust survivors</a> describes its inclusion criteria as &#34;...residents of the parts of Europe occupied by the Axis powers during World War II who survived until the end of the Holocaust (and the war). The majority of these people survived incarceration in the Nazi concentration camps, but that is not strictly necessary for the purposes of this list&#34; nor should it be necessary for retention of this category and inclusion therein. Any individual who was at substantial risk of arrest, internment and likely death in a concentration camp -- be they Jews, gays, gypsies, communists, partisans, etc. -- should be categorized and should be included here. Unfortunately, this is not the first example of a CfD where this nominator has used despicably offensive rationalizations to demand deletion of categories. While I think this more likely comes from plain ignorance than anti-Semitism, there is no excuse for this disgusting trivialization of a genuine life-and-death struggle for those Holocaust survivors, one which cannot be any more meaningful as a means of categorizing individuals. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 04:54, 22 January 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Strong Keep</b> in fact, I cannot understand the reasoning behind this proposed deletion at all.  Both the category <i>Holocaust survivor,</i> and the category <i>concentration camp survivor,</i> are well-deliniated catefories of intense and ongoing interest not merely to historians, but to wirters and filmmakers, to psychologists, to political scientists and to the millions of people around the world who continue to make books and films about the Jews who survived the Holocaust among the best-selling ategories of literature, theater and scholarship.  As fopr <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">User:Good Olfactory</a>&#39;s notion that <i>&#34;just being a Jew in 1930s/1940s Europe who managed to survive World War II.&#34;</i> is somehow insignificant or unworthy of attention.  (I am pausing in shock.)  It is possible that Good Olefactory is merely ignorant.  Ignorant of the fact that <i>every</i> Jews on the continent was hunted like a dog, and every survival required a <i>miracle.</i>  If Good Olefactory is an educated person with some awareness of that the Holocaust, the Nazi regime, and conditions in Europe for Jews in the Second World War were like, then his soul is in need of our prayers.<a href="" title="User:Historicist">Historicist</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Historicist">talk</a>) 23:39, 24 January 2009 (UTC)

<li>Good Olfactory, while I have no idea what the logic was behind the nomination, I would hope that you have come to realize that being a Holocaust survivor, even without having been in a concentration camp, is an extremely strong defining characteristic, and I would be hard pressed to name many that are more defining in shaping the life of an individual. Not only do I feel that the wording of your nomination is grossly insensitive, but I am not the only person who feels that way. I will ask here that you withdraw your nomination, which appears to have no viable chance of success, but a far greater likelihood of becoming even more contentious than it has already become if it drags on further and other editors become aware of the nomination here. If you insist that the nomination remain, you should very seriously consider refactoring the nomination as soon as possible to remove the wording that has deeply offended me and others participating here, as I have suggested earlier. There is still no justification for what appears to me to be a trivialization of the genuine life-and-death struggle of those Holocaust survivors, one which cannot be any more meaningful and defining as a means of categorizing individuals. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 04:31, 25 January 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Sorry, but I generally don&#39;t seek or take advice on the appropriateness of comments from editors who are on probation for incivility, much less from ones who have been recently blocked for leveling multiple personal attack against me. But I have consulted a number of other editors and none have suggested that the nomination wording is out of line. &#34;Controversy&#34; over a nomination like this typically only exists where users want to create one. You seem to want to create one, but to me that&#39;s irrelevant. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 05:12, 25 January 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It is truly disturbing that you cannot realize just how insensitive your grotesque trivialization of the experience of Holocaust survivors are. If you refuse to start dealing with the problem here, I am more than happy to pursue this issue through the RfC process, to address a rather disturbing and unfortunate ongoing pattern of utterly insensitive justifications for category deletions, this one only being the most unjustifiable, though your offensive trivializations of child molestation (<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2009_January_15#Category:Pedophiles" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2009_January_15#Category:Pedophiles">see here</a>) do also rank rather high.

<ul>
<li>As I said, it&#39;s only an issue for those who choose to make it one. Most people don&#39;t really care, because they can probably recognise that a CfD nomination is not to be read as a commentary on the validation or invalidation of real-world experiences. The words in question are not being added as part of a WP article, so I think you&#39;re outrage is a bit misplaced and reveals maybe a misunderstanding of the nature of what we are exactly doing in this forum. In short: I&#39;ve presented proposals for categories, which can legitimately be discussed and accepted or rejected, but I have not attacked other users. You can choose to continue to attack users and focus on issues surrounding personality and choice of words, but I am not interested in that aspect of the discussion you&#39;ve introduced. I doubt anyone else will be either, but if there&#39;s interest I suggest you take it to the talk page, where it belongs. I suggest again (as above) that we focus here on discussing the substantive proposals at CfD and ignore petty issues of personality or choice of words. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 06:44, 25 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Strong Keep</b>. It&#39;s certainly &#34;worthy&#34; of categorization if an individual was the target of Nazi persecution but managed not to be interred in the camps. <a href="" title="User:Shirulashem"><b>&#60;font color=&#34;#2B3856&#34;&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family: cursive&#34;&#62;shirulashem&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</b></a> <a href="" title="User talk:Shirulashem"><b>&#60;font color=&#34;#2B3856&#34;&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family: cursive&#34;&#62;(talk)&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</b></a> 01:31, 25 January 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. I agree with 75.34.31.194 and Alansohn above. This is part of a trio of categories that do serve a purpose. If your concern is that it only includes Jews, then find articles of Non-Jewish Holocaust survivors to add to the category. Perhaps similar categories could be created for survivors of other genocides as well, if they do not exist. <b><a href="" title="User:Vidioman">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#4B95B5&#34;&#62;vıd&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Vidioman">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#CC5500&#34;&#62;ıoman&#60;/span&#62;</a></b> 06:16, 25 January 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think that was a bit of a mis-reading of the reasons, since I explicitly stated that &#34;Holocaust&#34; typically refers to Jewish survivors/victims. Why then would I want to add non-Jewish victims to the category? Unless you are referring to the concentration camp survivors category—but it already does include non-Jewish survivors. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 06:46, 25 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> because the suggestion seems to be based on inaccurate information and unclear definitions of the history of the time since not all Holocaust survivors were in Nazi concentration or death camps. Many remained hidden all over Europe for the duration of the Holocaust and were even saved by righteous gentiles. Many took on aliases, or were taken into monastries and nunneries and remained in them after the Holocaust or escaped across international borders, as far as escaping to Siberia or Shanghai, managing to elude capture by the Nazi hordes. Some found refuge in thick woods and dense forests as they were surrounded by Nazis. There have been many books and documentaries about these documented historical cases of all these examples. It is hard to understand what would be gained by crushing people into categories they simply and factually do not belong in. <a href="" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:IZAK">talk</a>) 07:48, 25 January 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Clarification</b>. To be clear, since this seems to be a recurring misunderstanding of what I did say—I didn&#39;t suggest that all Holocaust survivors were in Nazi camps. I <i>did</i> suggest that for those who were not, being a Holocaust survivor is not necessarily defining, in which case they should not be in either category (and thus not &#34;merged&#34; (or &#34;crushed&#34; in &#60;small&#62;..... not <i>my</i> choice of words, Alansohn :)&#60;/small&#62; )) with the rest. Everyone&#39;s free to disagree with that proposal, of course, but I thought it would be good if everyone understood what was proposed rather than what&#39;s being misattributed to the nominator&#39;s rationale. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 08:28, 25 January 2009 (UTC) <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 08:05, 25 January 2009 (UTC)

<li>Hi Good Ol: What you say is not the accepted consensus because the notion of what defines a &#34;Holocaust survivor&#34; is expanding over time and certainly not contracting as you allege here. Can you cite any historians or scholars of the Holocaust who say what you say? Otherwise it may seem that you are veering to violations of <a href="" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a> and <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up one day">Wikipedia:Wikipedia is not for things made up one day</a>. Thanks for looking into this. Sincerely, <a href="" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:IZAK">talk</a>) 08:21, 25 January 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Hi IZAK, and thanks for your tone, it&#39;s a breath of fresh air to me. I understand what you are saying. I guess the easiest way to express my point is that I personally don&#39;t think that every person who is qualifies as a Holocaust survivor in the historical sense (or in the eyes of historians) is necessarily defined by being one in a WP sense. In other words, some are primarily notable for other things, not for being a Holocaust survivor. I realise that can be a controversial position to take, but I hope it clarifies what I mean. Perhaps that should logically suggest that I&#39;m not opposed to the existence of the category in the abstract (since someone could &#34;qualify&#34; for this category but not the camps one by (1) not being in a Nazi camp; and (2) by being defined by being a Holocaust survivor), but if the category is kept (which consensus is definitely trending towards) I did want to see some discussion on how we can define and apply this category most appropriately. Do you think it should apply to anyone who is historically seen as a Holocaust survivor in the broad or expanding sense you referred to, or should it be applied in some way that is more limited? <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 08:28, 25 January 2009 (UTC)

<li>Hi Good Ol: As Wikipedians, we cannot make up anything on our own. It would be a violation of <a href="" title="WP:NOR">WP:NOR</a> and <a href="" title="WP:NEO">WP:NEO</a>. In the wide world of Holocaust studies there is not, and has never been, a single definition of what constitutes &#34;a Holocaust survivor&#34; as far as I know. As you admit, you are also expressing a &#34;personal&#34; view, but that is very insufficient because we are dealing with serious history here with the Holocaust being the murder of about 6 million Jews and those who escaped it in Nazi dominated Europe are the survivors. So when one is trying to advocate new ideas, as you seem to be, there is always the danger of veering into even unintened <a href="" title="Holocaust revisionism">Holocaust revisionism</a> unfortunately. This is treacherous ground. The Nazis conducted the Holocaust in many ways, not just by sending people to concentration and death camps. Indeed before they discovred the &#34;wonders&#34; of <a href="" title="Zyklon B">Zyklon B</a> poison gas they relied on the more &#34;conventional&#34; means of mass executions by firing squads known as <a href="" title="Einsatzgruppen">Einsatzgruppen</a> all over Europe. Hundreds of thousands perished that way and there were those who escaped and survived from that as well, in caves, woods, forests, even converting to Christianity to save their necks sometimes. They are genuine Holocaust survivors and there are so many books on these topics. No set of historians has set about to do what you wish to do here, so for now, it may be best to let matters stand and follow <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Don&#39;t demolish the house while it&#39;s still being built">Wikipedia:Don&#39;t demolish the house while it&#39;s still being built</a>. I would say, that the term Holocaust only applies to those Jews who lived in countries occupied by the Nazis and their allies. Jews who served in the Allied armed forces are not &#34;Holocaust survivors&#34; but any civilian Jews who had lived in Europe when it was occupied by the Nazis and the Axis powers and who subsequently survived the occupation of Europe by Nazi Germany and its Axis friends, is definitely to some degree or other a Holocaust survivor because had the Nazis known about such living Jews they would have captured them and sent them to certain death, or kep them in caps where death woudl follow. So whether European Jews spent the Holocaust behind barbed wire or survived in hiding or starvation or death marches and lived to tell the tales, they are Holocaust survivors, what else can one call them? Hope this helps. <a href="" title="User:IZAK">IZAK</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:IZAK">talk</a>) 09:16, 25 January 2009 (UTC)

<li>Yes, I suppose we just must have different ideas about how categories should be applied. My view is that I don&#39;t think that a category should be applied in each and every case a particular status applies to someone, even if the status clearly applies. I&#39;m not arguing against people being called Holocaust survivors—on the contrary, I think the list is great. I think, however, that it&#39;s possible to acknowledge that someone is a Holocaust survivor but at the same time acknowledge that because it&#39;s not the principal reason they are notable, the WP category in question need not be applied to the person. I think your <a href="" title="WP:DEMOLISH">WP:DEMOLISH</a> comment is apt, though; I will be interested to see how the category comes to be applied, however. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 22:10, 25 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>I concur with everything that <a href="" title="User:Izak">User:Izak</a> has written.  But I would like to add that [[[[User:Good Olfactory]]&#39;s extreme enthusiasm for trivializing the Holocaust and his practice of going to personal pages and attacking editors who perceive the Holocaust and its survivors with respect do indeed give the appearance of a mild form of Hlocaust denial. Pretty much everyone commenting here agrees that <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">User:Good Olfactory</a>&#39;s assertion that &#34;just being a Jew in 1930s/1940s Europe who managed to survive World War II.&#34; is unworthy of a category, so good Olefactory has now shifted the debate to asserting that the categorry is poorly defined.  It has a strong and clear definition, the definition is  &#34;being a Jew in  Europe, during the War who managed to survive World War II.&#34;  Mimimization of this even is so morally repugnant that it is not wrong to question the motivations of minimizers.  I believe that <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">User:Good Olfactory</a> owes apologies to those whom he has insulted and blocked in the course of this debate.<a href="" title="User:Historicist">Historicist</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Historicist">talk</a>) 14:38, 25 January 2009 (UTC)

<li>I have attacked no one. I have repeatedly asked all users to refrain from such attacks, so I was reminding you to do so on your talk page. I again ask you to avoid discussions of me as a user as opposed to the merits of the category. It&#39;s irrelevant if everyone disagrees with my opinion or not—that is not a licence to attack me and say I&#39;m engaging in what appears to be &#34;a mild form of Hlocaust [sic] denial&#34;.  If you are unable to restrain yourself and thereby comply with WP standards of civility, please don&#39;t participate in the discussion. IZAK&#39;s comments and the comments immediately below are examples of how you can participate and disagree without making the issue personal. P.S.: I personally have blocked no editor as a result of this discussion: it was the result of a neutral adjudication that the comments in question violated a pre-existing editing restriction on Alansohn. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 22:01, 25 January 2009 (UTC)

<li>While it is heartening to see that so many editors have repudiated this offensive Holocaust trivialization, the underlying problem is far deeper than this one nomination and should be addressed through the <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment">Wikipedia:Requests for comment</a> process, which is designed to deal with problems of this nature. I think Good Olfactory could use some good old fashioned &#34;neutral adjudication&#34; in light of the ongoing pattern of problematic nominations which would hopefully lead to the type of &#34;editing restrictions&#34; he speaks of. Hopefully a rather strong lesson has been learned here by our nominator. P.S. See <a href="#Category:Pedophiles" title="Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2009_January_15">Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2009_January_15</a> for <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">User:Good Olfactory</a>&#39;s rather disturbing insistence that &#34;sexual molestation is often done for &#39;non-sexual&#39; reasons, and even if it is done for a sexual reason, we don&#39;t know if the person&#39;s primary sexual interest is in children or if it&#39;s just an &#39;on the side&#39; thing&#34;. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 03:24, 26 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>

<li><b>Keep</b> - they are different, and the difference is a useful one  - in fact <a href="" title="Category:Nazi concentration camp survivors">Category:Nazi concentration camp survivors</a> is a logical sub-cat of <a href="" title="Category:Holocaust survivors">Category:Holocaust survivors</a>, but I suppose I should not add it until this discussion is over. <b>However</b>, there is clearly a need for greater definition in this area. There is no agreement as to whether &#34;the Holocaust&#34; should only refer to Jewish persecutees, given that other groups/people(s) were also persecuted by the Nazis. Without wishing to take a position on that, for clarity I wonder whether these categories should either be renamed to make it clear that they are restricted to Jewish survivors/victims, or else redefined via scope-notes to make it equally clear that all victims of Nazi persecution can be included in them.<a href="" title="User:HeartofaDog">HeartofaDog</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:HeartofaDog">talk</a>) 16:38, 26 January 2009 (UTC)</li>
