<p>NAIA was founded in 1991 in <a href="" title="Portland, Oregon">Portland</a>, <a href="" title="Oregon">Oregon</a> by Dr. Adrian Morrison, DVM, PhD and Patti Strand.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.med.upenn.edu/ins/faculty/morrison.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.med.upenn.edu/ins/faculty/morrison.htm">University of Pennsylvania - Adrian Morrison</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Since the founding of NAIA, individuals and groups promoting animal welfare and animal husbandry have participated in the alliance, along with groups such as the <a href="" title="American Kennel Club">American Kennel Club</a>, <a href="" title="Canine Companions for Independence">Canine Companions for Independence</a>, and <a href="" title="Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association">Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association</a> and others.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.naiaonline.org/about/board.htm&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.naiaonline.org/about/board.htm&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.naiaonline.org/about/board.htm&#60;/ref&#62;</a></p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Positions">Positions</span></h2>

<p>Despite its active opposition to basic animal welfare legislation such as regulation of puppy mills and restrictions on horse slaughter, NAIA claims to support the responsible and humane use of animals for food, clothing, medical research, companionship, assistance, recreation, entertainment and education.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Pets">Pets</span></h3>

<p>In 2001, the NAIA opposed the Puppy Protection Act (S. 1478 and H.R. 3058) which would purportedly have added protections to the <a href="" title="Animal Welfare Act">Animal Welfare Act</a> to improve conditions for animals living in laboratories, <a href="" title="puppy mills">puppy mills</a> and pet stores. NAIA stated that the measure would be used to regulate every person who sells even one litter of puppies.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In 2007, Mark Cushing, a legal advisor for NAIA, argued on their behalf that damages for loss or harm to pets should remain unchanged. This position is also endorsed by the major veterinary organizations. This position was in response to recent efforts to increase damages for the harm or loss of pets.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>NAIA states that campaigns to end pet overpopulation have been so successful that a shortage of pets exists that is being filled by smuggling dogs into the United States which puts Americans and dogs in peril.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; The Humane Society of the United States reports that about 4 million cats and dogs are euthanized yearly in shelters in the US.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; While the Humane Society of the United States reports on the number of cats and dogs euthanized yearly in shelters, there is no differentiation between the number of adoptable animals versus the number of feral cats, which are considered unadoptable, and the number of dogs that are old, sick or have behavior problems. </p>
<p>NAIA is opposed to mandatory pet spay/neuter legislation. According to NAIA, costs and euthanasia rates both increase after the introduction of this type of legislation.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;
NAIA terms these programs coercive and states that ’spay or pay’ licensing schemes [have] little effect on reducing shelter intake and euthanasia rates while producing serious unintended consequences.”&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; <a href="" title="Animal rights">Animal rights</a> group PETA disputes this stating that spay/neuter is the only way to eliminate pet overpopulation and that mandatory spay/neuter legislation is a step towards this goal.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>NAIA is in favor of the commercial <a href="" title="horse slaughter">slaughter of horses</a>, stating that thousands of horses who would have been slaughtered and processed for food when this was allowed are now neglected and in poor health.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; The Humane Society of Missouri and other <a href="" title="animal welfare">animal welfare</a> organizations claim that there has been no increase in abandoned or unwanted horses since the federal ban in 2005.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; While various humane organizations may claim that there is no problem of abandoned or unwanted horses since the ban, the news media and official sources indicate that many horses are now being transported on long rides to Canada and to Mexico, where they are slaughtered in a manner far less humane than that used in the US. &#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-228&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-228&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-11-228&#60;/ref&#62;</a></p>
<p>NAIA opposes laws restricting the practices of <a href="" title="ear cropping">ear cropping</a>, <a href="" title="docking (dog)">tail docking</a>, <a href="" title="debarking">debarking</a> of dogs, and <a href="" title="declawing">removing the claws of cats</a>. Their opposition is based largely on what they believe to be activist campaigns to unnecessarily restrict the rights of animal owners and to remove these decisions from the owner and their veterinarian. NAIA states that these procedures, when properly done, do not cause pain; or that the animal is too young to have a developed nervous system.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;
All of these practices are banned in the UK&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; and
more than 20 countries ban declawing as extremely inhumane.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; <a href="#Legal_status_of_dog_tail_docking_and_ear_cropping_by_country" title="Docking_(dog)">Tail docking and ear cropping</a> are also banned in many jurisdictions.</p>
<p>The <a href="" title="American Kennel Club">American Kennel Club</a> lists NAIA as an allied group and the state AKC contact for Oregon concerning legislation regarding dog fancy. They indicate that NAIA is “interested in protecting and promoting the world of purebred dogs”.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; NAIA founder Patti Strand is a member of the board of directors of the AKC.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Industrialized_farming">Industrialized farming</span></h3>

<p>The NAIA lobbied against <a href="" title="California Proposition 2">California Proposition 2</a>, passed in November 2008, which was heavily promoted by the Humane Society of the United States.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Proposition 2 prohibits the confinement of certain farm animals in a manner that does not allow them to turn around freely, lie down, stand up, and fully extend their limbs. The measure deals with three types of confinement: <a href="" title="veal">veal</a> crates, <a href="" title="battery cages">battery cages</a>, and sow <a href="" title="gestation crates">gestation crates</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Animal_Enterprise_Terrorism_Act">Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act</span></h3>
<p>NAIA lobbied for passage of the <a href="" title="Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act">Animal Enterprise Terrorism Act</a> (AETA), which allows for special terrorism enhancements in the sentencing of animal rights activists despite the fact that no humans have ever been killed or injured by any action perpetrated by members of the Animal Liberation Front in the United States.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070525103152/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=903&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://web.archive.org/web/20070525103152/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=903&#60;/ref&#62;">http://web.archive.org/web/20070525103152/http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?pid=903&#60;/ref&#62;</a> NAIA stated that radical environmental and animal rights groups dominate the mainstream animal welfare movement. NAIA stated that these groups used  “violence, intimidation, arson, theft, and other crimes against biomedical researchers, furriers, hunters, trappers, dog and cat breeders, livestock farmers, zoos, circuses, rodeos, exotic animal breeders, and related enterprises.” These are the actions of radical animal rights activists which have been often reported by the news media.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; The ACLU, which opposed the AETA, claimed that the law &#34;criminalize(d) First Amendment activities such as demonstrations, leafleting, undercover investigations, and boycotts.&#34;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-letter-congress-urging-opposition-animal-enterprise-act-s-1926-and-hr-4239&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-letter-congress-urging-opposition-animal-enterprise-act-s-1926-and-hr-4239&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.aclu.org/free-speech/aclu-letter-congress-urging-opposition-animal-enterprise-act-s-1926-and-hr-4239&#60;/ref&#62;</a></p>
<p>Since 2001, NAIA has unsuccessfully attempted to challenge the non-profit status of animal rights groups, notably People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, stating that these groups “use intimidation, harassment and deception to raise money.” &#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Funding">Funding</span></h2>
<p>NAIA receives its primary financial support from donations from individuals, the majority of whom are pet owners who support the goals of NAIA, related businesses and associations in farm animal agribusiness, commercial breeding, hunting, fishing, trapping, fur ranching, animal research, rodeos and circuses. In other words, all the traditional animal interests.</p>
