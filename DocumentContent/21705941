<p>I don&#39;t see any claim to notability in this article. 14-year old does something v.stupid is not notable. Illegal act posted to youtube, ditto. Perp arrested as a result of youtube video, ditto. Incident used as space-filler to sell advertising in dead-tree publications, based on same AP news release, ditto. Combination of same, ditto. See also <a href="#NEWS" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> which states &#34;Wikipedia considers the historical notability of persons and events&#34;.

<li><b>Comment</b> - if this article IS kept, I strongly recommend we make certain the alleged perpetrator&#39;s identity is kept out of the article permanently on BLP grounds. <a href="" title="User:Exxolon">Exxolon</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Exxolon">talk</a>) 20:43, 25 February 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>On that point I disagree with you, but it is an issue to be addressed at the article&#39;s talk page or BLP/N, not here. <a href="" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:52, 25 February 2009 (UTC)  </li></ul></li>
<li><b>Keep</b> The mass propagation of the video and the fashion in which the video was analyzed toward the identification of an alleged perpetrator make this a remarkable case, more notable than a usual news event otherwise of this sort, toward which see the broad and non-trivial coverage in international publications the incident has received; even under the most restrictive interpretation of <a href="" title="WP:NOTNEWS">NOTNEWS</a>, then, and surely under the construction of NOTNEWS for which a consensus exists, this merits encyclopedic treatment.  <a href="" title="User:Jahiegel">Joe</a> 20:52, 25 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>- Wow, it survived a whole five hours before going up for deletion. Sarcasm aside, its received enough coverage in reliable sources that notability is not an issue. Its written based on the incident, not the person (who&#39;s name probably hasn&#39;t even been released), so there&#39;s no BLP1E issue involved either. <a href="" title="User:Umbralcorax">Umbralcorax</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Umbralcorax">talk</a>) 21:30, 25 February 2009 (UTC)

<li>And you and others make the mistake of confusing multiple RS with notability. They are not the same thing. Notability asks for &#34;historical notability&#34; for news stories. This is far from the first youtube posting which has led to a perp being identified. It has no historical notability whatsoever, just none whatsoever. Multiple RS simply means that multiple newspapers thought is was a colourful enough story to run: god help us if tabloid preferences become our guide. --<a href="" title="User:Tagishsimon">Tagishsimon</a> <a href="" title="User_talk:Tagishsimon">(talk)</a> 21:39, 25 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<dd>As I understand it, the first and formost indicator of notability <b>is</b> multiple independent sources. Much like Paris Hilton, this is incredibly stupid and if it weren&#39;t for the press coverage, nobody would care. But also like Hilton, there is press coverage. From all over, not just local. That makes it notable enough to cover here. <a href="" title="User:Umbralcorax">Umbralcorax</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Umbralcorax">talk</a>) 22:01, 25 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>It has been argued that <a href="" title="WP:NOTNEWS">WP:NOTNEWS</a> provides a rationale to delete this article. That policy states that &#34;[r]outine news coverage of such things as announcements, sports, and tabloid journalism are not sufficient basis for an article&#34;; this is clearly not such a topic. It stresses that articles on individuals notable for one event are to be avoided; that is precisely what this article does, in lieu of an article on the perpetrator(s). The &#34;think of the children&#34; argument that the article is &#34;a <a href="" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> minefield&#34; is plainly <i>not</i> a reason to delete it, for if all such articles were worthy of deletion, we would deprive our readers of articles on <a href="" title="Rihanna">Rihanna</a>, <a href="" title="Child suicide bombers in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict">Child suicide bombers in the Israeli–Palestinian conflict</a>, <a href="" title="Family of Sarah Palin">Family of Sarah Palin</a> and so on. Let&#39;s be very clear on this point: <b>Notability is not subjective.</b> <i><a href="" title="The Irish Times">The Irish Times</a></i> and <i><a href="" title="The Telegraph">The Telegraph</a></i> are prominent broadsheet newspapers, and without doubt reliable sources independent of this topic.

In short, this topic clearly meets the encyclopaedia&#39;s threshold for inclusion, the <a href="" title="WP:GNG">general notability guideline</a>. This discussion has thus far provided exceptionally poor rationales as to why this point ought to be ignored. &#60;font color=&#34;404040&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Skomorokh">&#60;font face=&#34;Goudy Old Style&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Skomorokh&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 09:21, 26 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> We have Harvard Law and several other reliable sources covering the incident. Of course BLP is an issue. We should make every effort to not ruin the kid&#39;s life because of one mistake, but it&#39;s doable to navigate the so-called BLP minefield. If it turns out this is later forgotten, we can always delete it then. If it turns out we can&#39;t navigate the minefield effectlive, ditto. - <a href="" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic">&#60;sup&#62;(talk)&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 10:13, 26 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b>. There seems to be a consensus to keep such articles with much 3rd party mention, even if the issue may well be forgotten in a decade or so (or very much sooner).  There was recently a snowfall in the UK which hit Wiki&#39;s front page.  If Wiki is a repository of the world&#39;s knowledge, it could also be an archive of such events, even if there might be some issues with <a href="" title="ethnocentrism">ethnocentrism</a>.

<li><b>Delete</b> - I agree with the notnews/meme/etc arguments. This became an issue only because a bunch of teenagers at 4chan decided to take revenge over it (as a cat person, I was rooting for them, but that&#39;s besides the point), and it&#39;s the only reason this article exists. Thousands of animals are abused every day, and many of those occurrences are also brought to the attention of the authorities and the perpetrators punished in some way. Yet we don&#39;t have articles about those. As a standalone event outside of the intertubes angle, it&#39;s completely non-notable at best. And it didn&#39;t even turn into a notable meme that I can see. &#60;span style=&#34;color:dimgray; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;&#34;&#62;§<a href="" title="User:FreeRangeFrog">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#007138&#34;&#62;FreeRangeFrog&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62; 18:29, 26 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> per Guy and others. We&#39;re not a news site or dumping ground for 4chan crap. Notability is not temporary, and this is just another flash in the pan.

<li>Yeah, that was a bad example because <a href="" title="Daniel Solove">Daniel Solove</a> wrote a book where that incident played a big part, which is why it was on my mind, but that&#39;s what made that notable (though I see the book isn&#39;t cited, but the blog post is).  Still, I believe in <a href="#NEWS" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, even if AfD generally doesn&#39;t. I can see discussion of the incident in <a href="" title="Internet vigilantism">Internet vigilantism</a>, so it&#39;s not like I&#39;m for purging the content; I just don&#39;t believe in having all the parallel articles with duplicate content that we have. <a href="" title="User:THF">THF</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:THF">talk</a>) 00:51, 1 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>

A comparable event in a year won&#39;t get the same media attention, and would likely not meet our notability standards. For now, this is what it looks like when new cultural ground is broken. &#60;small&#62;Freaky, huh?&#60;/small&#62; I don&#39;t remember anything in my childhood comparable to &#34;U.S. cat abuser punished by the internet&#34;. &#60;p&#62; Whenever the histories of the Internet are written, and this event is put into a historical context, then we&#39;ll deal with it in those terms, but until then, I think it passes muster. &#60;small&#62;What I don&#39;t understand it what would make a kid want to do that to a cat.&#60;/small&#62; -<a href="" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a>&#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 02:35, 27 February 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Keep</b>. Several extremely good secondary sources establish notability. We know that wikipedians are generally biased against 4chan and related trolling sites.

<li><b>Weak keep</b> . Frankly the abuse itself is NOT notable.  YouTube probably has hundreds of animal abuse videos, I really don&#39;t see the point in this.  however, 4chan trolls&#39; admittedly respectable response really began to push this event into being notable.  yes, it&#39;s sensational, silly, and needlessly immature--but it&#39;s a popular event, stealing coverage from notable sources.  reluctant keep... <a href="" title="User:Mikey9090">Mikey9090</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mikey9090">talk</a>) 11:01, 27 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
