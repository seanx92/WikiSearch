The original submission was for failure of <a href="" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.  Most everyone agreed that the article was about her theories and her books were a reliable source on her theories.  However there was another argument about <a href="" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>.  She is rather well known but during the debate the people who wanted to keep the article were unable to provide examples of where she is cited outside of the web.  She provided a long list <a href="#Acharya.27s_Response" title="User talk:Jclemens/Acharya_S">User talk:Jclemens/Acharya_S</a> which I think meets <a href="" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> clearly.  In addition, since the time of the deletion debate she has been discussed for several pages in a book on view of Jesus (<a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0826449166" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0826449166">ISBN 0826449166</a> p 208) and is has an extended interview in another documentary entitled, &#34;God in the Box&#34;.  
I think the original deletion was a mistake.  The new evidence however I believe demands reconsideration. I can&#39;t view the deleted article but <a href="" title="User:Jclemens/Acharya S">User:Jclemens/Acharya S</a> is a tentative version of what the article will could look like.  <a href="" title="User:jbolden1517">jbolden1517</a>&#60;sup&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;DarkGreen&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:jbolden1517">Talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 05:31, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

<b>Commment</b> This has nothing to do with the deletion review but... <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Acharya Sita Ram Chaturvedi">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Acharya Sita Ram Chaturvedi</a> is listed on her deletion page.

Higher standards are rightly placed on BLP articles, both in terms of <a href="" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a> and <a href="" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a>. The latter appears to have been accomplished quite well here, the former is still, imo, lacking. <a href="" title="User:Usrnme h8er">Usrnme h8er</a>&#38;nbsp;(<a href="" title="User talk:Usrnme h8er">talk</a>&#38;nbsp;<b>·</b> <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Usrnme h8er">contribs</a>) 10:31, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>So just to clarify you do believe notability has been established your concern is just with the current form of the article?  The reason I&#39;m asking is needs better sources from the pool of existing sources is generally not grounds for deletion but rather for editing.  Now that we have the list of 65 3rd party cites its pretty easy to work some in.  As far as <a href="" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a> the goal of this article is to document her work not her life, that&#39;s why the article is Acharya S (the pen name) and not D.M. Murdock (the author&#39;s real name).  <a href="" title="User:jbolden1517">jbolden1517</a>&#60;sup&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;DarkGreen&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:jbolden1517">Talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 13:45, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If, as you suggest, &#34;the goal of this article is to document her work not her life,&#34; then might I suggest you write an article on her books (if you feel her work is notable). That might be a better avenue than a biography of a living person. Just a thought. Thanks. <a href="" title="User:Ism schism">Ism schism</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ism schism">talk</a>) 21:32, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I&#39;m fine with that as a resolution.   &#34;Theories of D.M. Murdock&#34;, &#34;Writings of D.M. Murdock&#34;....  In some sense Acharya S is not a living person, D.M. Murdock is a living person.  Acharya S is just a pen name.  The goal was never a biography of Murdock but a descriptive article of Murdock&#39;s ideas. <a href="" title="User:jbolden1517">jbolden1517</a>&#60;sup&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;DarkGreen&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:jbolden1517">Talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 03:26, 13 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>If you want to go in that direction you could go to a userfied version first, like the <b>Acharya S</b> article at <a href="" title="User:Jclemens/Acharya S">User:Jclemens/Acharya S</a>, and work on the content and sourcing. I would think this would be the best option. In addition, another  option might be to start an article at either <a href="" title="Theories of D.M. Murdock">Theories of D.M. Murdock</a> or <a href="" title="Writings of D.M. Murdock">Writings of D.M. Murdock</a>. These are just suggestions, as I do not think the present BLP passes either notability or reliable sources.

<dd>Afds should be closed based on the consensus.

<dd>OK, more than a superficial look is needed here.  You are not a newbie complaining about the deletion of your poo article.  You have good points.  There is a historical perspective here.  There are lots of news reports, but they go for far longer than a “short burst”.  The subject received many mentions, brief, but not “trivial”.  It seems to be used as an example in serious study, but is it really a subject in itself?  Can you provide the paper written by Michele Knobel and Colin Lankshear, presented at the NRC Annual Meeting?  I want to see what these references say about the subject.  Does a source actually say that this story has had lasting impact and significance?   I’m still inclined to think that this story should be fleshed out as part of the encompassing subject, <a href="" title="Internet vigilantism">Internet vigilantism</a>, but I’ll need to look into it later.  --<a href="" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:SmokeyJoe">talk</a>) 07:37, 10 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>All baseball players are discussed in the context of baseball.  Your logic would lead us to merging all of those to one article also, so clearly there is a point where being part of a wider issue doesn&#39;t justify merger to that issue.

<dd>Straw man. If practically none of the sources discuss the incident except as part of that subject, then you have no independent notability.

<dd>Trying to take a break from WP, but...  I&#39;m not seeing anything about a topic needing to be discussed in isolation.  Is Hamlet (the character) discussed outside of Hamlet the play?

<dd>NOTNEWS does not require academic sources that talk about an event in its own right.  Or any sources that talk about it in its own right.

Being discussed in the <i>Washington Post</i> or other RS doesn&#39;t contradict it being in violation of <a href="#NEWS" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> at all - because the <i>Washington Post</i> is after all a newspaper.  Furthermore, I didn&#39;t go for Delete - though I was tempted - because the content actually sits better in the <a href="" title="Internet vigilantism">Internet vigilantism</a> article (and improves that one) than it does on its own. And let&#39;s look at those sources in a bit more detail - &#34;Multiple reliable sources&#34; is misleading. The <i>Post</i> article is actually written from an Internet vigilantism angle (as does the Chosun piece), which makes the redirect more relevant than a keep; the <i>New York Times</i> only mentions the issue in passing in a piece about cats and dogs on the Internet, and most of the rest are either blogs or reference them.

<li><b>Overturn to no consensus</b> While arguments on both sides may have been weak, it is inappropriate to merge and redirect the article when it&#39;s clearly not supported by the community at large. It does have its downsides.

Also, it could never be binding; merges are completely allowable under <a href="" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>. Admins cannot be vote-counting machines; otherwise we could set up a script to close all AfDs. Strength of argument <i>has</i> to be taken into account - see also <a href="#Cellebrum_Technologies_Limited" title="Wikipedia:Deletion_review/Log/2009_March_8">this DRV</a> where I discounted some Delete votes and closed as No Consensus.  On this basis the two possible outcomes were redirect or delete - and I&#39;d suggest that the merge/redirect into a more suitable article <i>is</i> the compromise that you mention. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Black Kite">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Black Kite&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/b&#62; 10:35, 10 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>People go into a merge discussion with another mindset. In AFD they&#39;re more likely to look for reasons to delete something. As for my reasoning. I found the outcome no consensus best because the delete and keep arguments were both equally bad. Merging and redirecting may be allowable as an individual action, but we&#39;re talking about how the discussion should&#39;ve been closed. A no consensus close wouldn&#39;t stop you from merging. As for a merge discussion not being binding, neither is a deletion discussion. The difference is that merge policy is a lot more vague. - <a href="" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic">&#60;sup&#62;(talk)&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 08:44, 11 March 2009 (UTC) </li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Overturn</b> I&#39;d have brought this here too, but NW beat me to the admin&#39;s talk page.  The close, while not an unreasonable result, had nothing at all to do with the AfD.

<dd>That was a major point i was making. As you say it&#39;s not an unreasonable decision but it was the opinion of the closing and rendered the whole afd discussion pointless.

<li>Yes in fact. <i>That</i> outcome had significant arguments in in the AfD.  It isn&#39;t the closer&#39;s job to find a compromise novel from the discussion, it is their job to identify consensous.  I&#39;d have disagreed with it as I don&#39;t think the AfD went that way, but it would have been a better close. If you felt consensous was for delete that&#39;s exactly what I think you should have done.  <i>Ideally</i> you&#39;d have suggested the redirect/merge as a participant.

<li><b>Overturn</b> I think there was no consensus. Solving by a compromise is always possible, but the objections to the article would not really be met by a merger. I didn&#39;t !vote in the AfD, because I couldn&#39;t decide about it.</li></ul>

<dd>more generally, we have a problem with the use of merge and redirect as closes in Afd. They are basically editing decisions, but they are also frequent AfD compromises. And they are also sometimes used after afd in order to in effect reverse the decision. for example, instead of appealing this, someone could have boldly reverted the merge. The closer would then have needed to defend it as an editing decision at the article talk page, and an admin has no special powers in editing decisions. This would be true in all such closings--if not immediately after, then any time later, possibly  using the argument that consensus had changed. We have  two alternatives: discuss contested merges and redirects in a public process like XfD--which is what we currently do for some of them, or discuss them at the talk page--which is also what we currently do for some of them. We have two competing processes that can yield contradictory results. <b><a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> (<a href="" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a>) 13:37, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I did consider a bold revert, using the new sources to create a longer more substantial article but considering the strength of some of the objections to the article, it would likely have caused an edit war so I decided to request a review the decision instead, i posted the academic sources quite late in the afd and I believe the outcome would have been an obvious keep if they were presented earlier which is something a closing admin should consider.

<dd>As mentioned above, if you wish, I can withdraw this closure and re-close it as Delete.

<dd>That is also incorrect, there was no consensus and equally strong points for keep and deletion (are we ignoring the 14 or so editors who expressed that this was adequately covered in reliable sources, is that not a valid point rooted in notability policy?), the points for deletion based on the &#39;news event&#39;, that may have been valid when made, were disproven by the presentation of the academic sources. By the finish of the afd there were no longer any valid deletion points. This should haver been considered in the closing and why i believe it was done incorrectly.

<dd>The problem is, when I see a !vote like &#34;strong keep, discussed in the New York Times&#34; and then I read that source to see that it is a trivial mention of the event in an article about cats and dogs, one does tend to think that people are (a) not actually reading the sources, and (b) <i>assuming</i> that being mentioned in a RS makes something automatically notable.

<dd>Right, so they said something based on policy and no one challenged it in the discussion.

<dd>That&#39;s not always the case, and has been especially highlighted by BLP deletions recently where even policy-based consensus was to Keep.

By the same token, would you argue that those &#34;endorse as reasonable close&#34; !votes here should be discounted because it isn&#39;t clear that they&#39;ve read the discussion?  If not, could you explain the difference? <a href="" title="User:Hobit">Hobit</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hobit">talk</a>) 14:26, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>If you are closing XfDs correctly, then you <i>have</i> to strength of argument into account. However, when you come to close a long AfD it would simply be ludicrous to attempt to contact dozens of editors to ask them to clarify their comments. All I am saying here is that a &#34;Keep, mentioned in XYZ paper&#34; !vote, when reading that XYZ source shows that it is a throwaway sentence in an irrelevant article (or for that matter, a &#34;Delete, no reliable sources&#34; !vote when reliable sources <i>are</i> clearly shown in the article) is definitely going to be discounted to some extent.  Otherwise you are simply vote-counting. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Black Kite">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Black Kite&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/b&#62; 15:12, 11 March 2009 (UTC)  </li></ul>

<ul>
<li>Certainly you need to take into account strength of argument.  But you are replacing your own judgement about the value of the sources with what was concluded in the discussion.  That isn&#39;t a closers role.  If the closer&#39;s role was to evaluate the quality of sources, what would be the point of the AfD discussion?  Why should anyone chime in if the closer can reach their own conclusion using arguments not found in the discussion? To me the issue is fundemental: what is the role of the closer vs. the role of those discussing.  The admin bit should be used as a mop.  Certainly you take strength of argument into account.  But you don&#39;t discount policy-based arguments because you disagree with them.  Otherwise we live in a land where whoever closes the discussion makes the call.  And that&#39;s going to cause problems.  <a href="" title="User:Hobit">Hobit</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hobit">talk</a>) 17:19, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li>To a certain extent, such an evaluation <i>is</i> required.  Here is a hypothetical:  You have an AfD, 3 keep !votes on the basis that the sources in the article are reliable per <a href="" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>, and three !votes for delete on the grounds that there is no coverage that they can find in WP:RS.  The sources being referred to are self-published blogs - how do you close it?  Do you no consensus it because you mustn&#39;t judge the sources and whether they meet the cited policies, or do you make the judgement that the sources <i>don&#39;t</i> meet WP:RS and close accordingly?  <a href="" title="User:Fritzpoll">Fritzpoll</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Fritzpoll">talk</a>) 17:25, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>You close it as no consensus because there wasn&#39;t one, simple as that. If the sources were in dispute it needs to be done in the afd not by the closer. There is no hurry to delete an article, we should always look to keep if it is unclear that&#39;s why it defaults to that. Otherwise we risk damaging the project. --&#60;span style=&#34;font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: underline; color:black; border: 1pt solid white; padding: 0pt 4pt; background-color: white;&#34;&#62;neon white&#60;/span&#62;&#60;small&#62; <a href="" title="User_talk:Neon white">talk</a>&#60;/small&#62; 18:58, 11 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>No - that&#39;s exactly what you <i>don&#39;t</i> do - you examine the sources. An AfD is not necessarily unclear because some people have voted in different ways. If the sources are good, you close Keep; if the sources are unreliable or otherwise poor, you close Delete; if it isn&#39;t clear, <i>then</i> you close No Consensus. Futhermore, keeping articles which should be deleted damages the project as much as deleting ones which shouldn&#39;t be.&#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Black Kite">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Black Kite&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/b&#62; 19:06, 11 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your misunderstnading of Afd closing and consensus that you are demonstrating here is likely the reason why you closed this one wrongly in my opinion. It is not up to the closing editor to change the consensus. Closing is not an afd comment, it&#39;s a summary of the discussion, if you want to make a point about the sources it needs to be done in the discussion. Think of it like an admin/secetary taking minutes in a board room meeting, you summarise the discussion and note the decision made but you do not change them based on your own feelings or record a decison that wasnt made. That&#39;s get you fired! --&#60;span style=&#34;font-size: 10pt; text-decoration: underline; color:black; border: 1pt solid white; padding: 0pt 4pt; background-color: white;&#34;&#62;neon white&#60;/span&#62;&#60;small&#62; <a href="" title="User_talk:Neon white">talk</a>&#60;/small&#62; 19:23, 11 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>So - and this is a hypothetical example - you are saying that a closing admin should weigh a comment which says &#34;Keep - well sourced&#34; equally to one which says &#34;Delete - no reliable sources&#34; <i>even if there aren&#39;t any reliable sources quoted</i>?  If that&#39;s what you&#39;re saying, I think the misunderstanding of how AfD works is yours. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Black Kite">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Black Kite&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/b&#62; 11:35, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>If you needed more sources, we could&#39;ve found some of the massive coverage in the Korean media about this specific incident.  Most people felt there was enough to warrant the article&#39;s existance.  So, even when most people believe an article is notable, it doesn&#39;t matter, because its all about the opinion of the administrator.  Everyone else is just wasting their time then.

<li>I&#39;m going to have to agree with Black Kite here. Wikipedia is neither a democracy or a beurocracy and introducing more rules on the issue is just inviting to wikilawyerism. You want a list of what admins will almost instantly discount? Have a look at <a href="" title="WP:AADD">WP:AADD</a>, a good overview of weak arguements - in both directions - but an essay, not even a guideline. Introducing a list of arguements/!votes ignored and making that exclusive would just go further towards the whole thing being a vote, which it isn&#39;t. If anything, I would prefer if <i>&#60;nowiki&#62;<b>Vote</b>&#60;/nowiki&#62;</i> were the ignored part and ONLY discussion was taken into account. That way, people just posting <i>&#34;It&#39;s a notable event&#34;</i> or <i>&#34;sources are invalid&#34;</i> would barely even be noticed. I do however recognize that this is probably unrealistic. <a href="" title="User:Usrnme h8er">Usrnme h8er</a>&#38;nbsp;(<a href="" title="User talk:Usrnme h8er">talk</a>&#38;nbsp;<b>·</b> <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Usrnme h8er">contribs</a>) 09:42, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<dd>So what? Wikipedia has changed since it was founded in many significiant ways and admins using their discretion in closing difficult or close AFDs is enshrined in our deletion policy. This looks like a good close by an experienced and clueful admin who made the best choice available.

<li><b>Overturn</b>.  The editor did not have the right to go against consensus.  Don&#39;t vote to endorse simply because you don&#39;t like the article.  That isn&#39;t what this is about.  The point of the AFD process is to form a consensus before taking any action, not for an administrator to ignore everything said, and do whatever he feels like it. <a href="" title="User:Dream Focus"><b>&#60;span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;&#62;D&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:green&#34;&#62;r&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;e&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:orange&#34;&#62;a&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:purple&#34;&#62;m&#60;/span&#62; &#60;span style=&#34;color:blue&#34;&#62;Focus&#60;/span&#62;</b></a><b> 10:44, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</b></li>

<dd><b>Comment</b> My lack of good faith? How could you even accuse me of this? Where did I attack you? I raised the concern that this article was nominated on WP:IDONTLIKEIT not that your nomination was done on bad faith. Just so you know I read the entire debate and my argument is legitmate in all ways. You have not brought any new information or consensus that was not covered in the previous AfD. Your reason for deletion was <i>Contested PROD. Non-notable, single event internet meme.</i>, the previous reason was <i>Per WP:ONEEVENT I believe this should be erased from Wikipedia, this was a small interest story for a short while in the internet community but beyond the dog poop incident she is without question not notable.</i> Nothing new here.

It appears to me that this closure was a misreading of the AfD discussion. Although some editors changed their !votes after an infusion of dubiously relevant refs into the article, little opportunity was afforded them to rechange their opinions after those refs were called into question. Requesting either a reopening and relisting at AfD, or a reversal to a &#34;delete&#34; closure. <a href="" title="User:Deor">Deor</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Deor">talk</a>) 01:05, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Closing admin</b> <a href="" title="WP:RELIST">WP:RELIST</a> discourages relisting such debates where many comments have been made.  That several users changed their comments from delete to keep and that several established users disagreed on keeping or deleting even after relisting is what pushed this to an NC. <b><a href="" title="User:MBisanz">&#60;span style=&#39;color: #FFFF00;background-color: #0000FF;&#39;&#62;MBisanz&#60;/span&#62;</a></b> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:MBisanz">&#60;span style=&#39;color: #FFA500;&#39;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 01:12, 10 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>endorse or weak overturn to keep</b> I think 6 to 6 on delete !votes (if you count the nom and don&#39;t count the double vote).  Objections to the references were made on the 8th, this was closed on the 10th.  Given that many of the delete !votes came before improvement, keep would have been a slightly better close. <a href="" title="User:Hobit">Hobit</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hobit">talk</a>) 02:40, 10 March 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Overturn to keep</b> or endorse as no consensus.  I voted on March 2 to delete.  After work done on the 7th and 8th I voted to keep.  I am note sure all discussants were aware of the late revisions.

<li><b>Endorse “no consensus”</b>, meaning keep for now.  The debate had already attracted sufficient participation.  There was a mix of opinions.  The ground moved during the debate, with continued editing of the article.  The close was definitely appropriate.  Leave it at least a month or two, and if the article stabilises in an unsatisfactory form, feel free to renominate.  --<a href="" title="User:SmokeyJoe">SmokeyJoe</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:SmokeyJoe">talk</a>) 03:49, 10 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Endorse “no consensus”</b>, hard to see the discussion as a clear keep or delete. I&#39;ll also look to adding the google news refs and books but it will have to wait a day or two while I catch up on rl work and other wp duties. <a href="" title="User_talk:Benjiboi">-- &#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px; font-family: cursive;color:#8000FF&#34;&#62;Banj&#60;font color=&#34;#FF4400&#34;&#62;e&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;&#60;u style=&#34;font-size:14px;font-family: Zapfino, sans-serif;color:deeppink&#34;&#62;b&#60;font color=&#34;#CC0000&#34;&#62;oi&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/u&#62;</a> 05:16, 10 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Endorse closure</b>, couldn&#39;t have been closed any other way. Relisting is only permitted where no more than one or two editors have contributed, or where the contributions were lacking in policy-based arguments, and it&#39;s this way exactly because relisting articles over and over in the forlorn hope that the debate might swing one way rarely accomplishes anything. Anyone can feel free to renominate after a reasonable time if the article hasn&#39;t improved. <a href="" title="User:Stifle">Stifle</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Stifle/wizard">talk</a>) 09:27, 10 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></td></tr>
