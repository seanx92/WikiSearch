<dd><i>The result of the discussion was:</i>  <b>Delete</b>. If a category structure is developed that requires this as a parent, it can be recreated.  However, I think this information should be listified.  That would allow grouping by country played in and by country from, both of those items seemed to be of concern in the discussion.  Also if you included the year signed, sorting by this could show the increase of these players over time. <a href="" title="User:Vegaswikian">Vegaswikian</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Vegaswikian">talk</a>) 23:15, 18 March 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Delete</b>: The supercategory is really unnecessary; there are quite a few categories delineating where players are born, and being born outside of one specific country doesn&#39;t make it specifically notable. It looks like cruft to me and could spawn <a href="" title="Category:Major League Baseball players born outside of Canada">Category:Major League Baseball players born outside of Canada</a>, etc. Where a player is born is notable and worth categorizing.

<li><b>Keep</b>  Baseball is becoming more and more a globalized american sport.  The vast majority of Major Leaguers have been American born.  If someone is researching or needs a reference to foreign born Major Leaguers this would the only category or article that list list all them.  I think that there should be a link on the category to each nationality&#39;s category as well.  It does not list where players were not born, that would be this <a href="" title="Category: Major League Baseball Players not born in Sri Lanka">Category: Major League Baseball Players not born in Sri Lanka</a>, which would be useless.<a href="" title="User:Racingstripes">Racingstripes</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Racingstripes">talk</a>) 20:49, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li><b>Comment</b> - This might be legitimate as a parent category, but should generally only contain categories, not articles.  However it sounds as if theat category scheem already exists.  Anyway Should it not be &#34;United States Major League Baseball Players ...&#34;.  <a href="" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Peterkingiron">talk</a>) 11:15, 14 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd><b>Comment</b> I reiterate: This category, an umbrella category, is useful. Having specific categories for different countries does not allow one to easily see non-American born players. I don&#39;t understand why we would delete something that is useful. Also, although the list may be large, it is finite. <a href="" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kingturtle">talk</a>) 12:57, 14 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Your suggestion is contrary to the Wikipedia <a href="" title="WP:SUBCAT">guideline on subcategorization</a>. The general rule is that if a subcategory exists that is part of a systematic scheme for breaking down the parent category, then pages classified in the subcategory should not also be categorized in the parent category .  For example, players categorized in <a href="" title="Category:Major League Baseball players from Japan">Category:Major League Baseball players from Japan</a> should not be categorized in the parent category <a href="" title="Category:Major League Baseball players by national origin">Category:Major League Baseball players by national origin</a>. It follow that if this new category is kept, then <a href="" title="Category:Major League Baseball players from Japan">Category:Major League Baseball players from Japan</a> would be subcategory, and Japanese MLB players should only be categorized in the subcategory and not in this as a parent category. With that general guidance, I don&#39;t see any rationale for keeping this category, since completing the categorization of MLB players by national origin would make it quite simple to pull out all of the subcategories except players born in the United States. The approach of categorization by national origin is also more flexible; for example, you could easily modify your criteria to exclude players born in the United States and Canada. The effort should go into finishing the categorization of MLB players by national origin, not for creating a special category of limited usefulness. <a href="" title="User:BRMo">BRMo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:BRMo">talk</a>) 14:42, 14 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd><b>Question</b> Without this category, how would I currently pull up all players born outside the U.S.? <a href="" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kingturtle">talk</a>) 22:56, 14 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Right now, you can&#39;t pull up those names with or without this category, because (a) this category hasn&#39;t been completed (it currently only shows 400 players, compared to 1,552 born outside the U.S. as shown at bb-ref); and (b) the categorization within <a href="" title="Category:Major League Baseball players by national origin">Category:Major League Baseball players by national origin</a> also hasn&#39;t been completed, and is currently only available for Japan and Taiwan.  Since effort will be required to complete either categorization, I think it would be better spent on completing the breakdown by national origin, which would allow you greater flexibility since it would allow you to include or exclude any countries you wished. <a href="" title="User:BRMo">BRMo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:BRMo">talk</a>) 06:27, 15 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I would like to know then, if this category cannot be completed, what other plan can we initiate to be able to create lists of U.S.-born and non-U.S.-born players? <a href="" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kingturtle">talk</a>) 17:40, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>We should fill in the subcategories for the missing countries in <a href="" title="Category:Major League Baseball players by national origin">Category:Major League Baseball players by national origin</a>. It should be straightforward to do so, since we have available lists of MLB players by country and external sources like bb-ref. <a href="" title="User:BRMo">BRMo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:BRMo">talk</a>) 23:04, 17 March 2009 (UTC) </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Use as a parent category</b> In essence, you&#39;ve got binary categories - born in the U.S., and not born in the U.S. Then you get into issues of players that are U.S. citizens but were born in overseas U.S. military bases and/or U.S. territories. Which group do they fall into?

<li><b>Delete</b>; too overbroad to be useful. Re-creating it as <a href="" title="Category:Major League Baseball players born outside the United States">Category:Major League Baseball players born outside the United States</a>, and then putting all the non-US national categories in it, might be useful, but players should not be individually categorized in this way. <a href="" title="User:Mackensen">Mackensen</a> <a href="" title="User_talk:Mackensen">(talk)</a> 11:00, 16 March 2009 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Not at all. There are frequent occurrences of players representing countries other than the country they were born in. Most frequently you have American-born players choosing not to play for USA and instead playing for a country that they might&#39;ve had an ancestor from. There are a variety of reasons for this, but the country where one is born does not determine WBC status or much of anything baseball-related, really. <a href="" title="User:Enigmaman"><b>&#60;font color=&#34;blue&#34;&#62;Enigma&#60;/font&#62;</b></a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Enigmaman"><i>&#60;font color=&#34;#FFA500&#34;&#62;msg&#60;/font&#62;</i></a>&#60;/sup&#62; 21:32, 18 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b> Per many successful &#34;City, State&#34; nominations over the last two weeks. Louisville is a problem city because the metro area stretches across two states. I personally would purge at least anything on the Indiana side from these categories. I&#39;m not a big fan of using metro area categories except when it&#39;s impossible to figure out city borders, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case here. But we should make one decision or another on these. FYI, I don&#39;t like the &#34;architecture and infrastructure&#34; pairing at all, so I recommend picking one, and purging any outliers.--<a href="" title="User:Mike Selinker">Mike Selinker</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mike Selinker">talk</a>) 06:38, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<li><b>Rename</b> categories to use &#34;Louisville, Kentucky&#34; instead of &#34;Louisville&#34;, but always indicate that it&#39;s about a metropolitan area (if it&#39;s not indicated that way already).  All major city categories should include subjects/articles from their metropolitan areas.  Metro areas exist for a reason -- there are many bonds between the central city and the surrounding suburbs/exurbs, including a somewhat common culture, not to mention media market.  The Louisville metro area is a 13-county region, and to exclude subjects from Louisville categories simply because they&#39;re not inside of Louisville/Jefferson County proper is ignoring how metro areas are so cooperative in their nature. <a href="" title="User:Stevietheman">&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<b>Stevie is the man!</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Stevietheman">Talk</a> &#38;bull; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Stevietheman">Work</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 17:01, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The identification of a document as an apostolic exhortation has relevance in the study of Catholic doctrine, as it is somewhere in the middle of the ranking of papal writings (constitutions and encyclicals being of central importance, letters and messagesn not so). But every apostolic exhortation may not be notable. FWIW I count 28 being issued since John XXIII at www.vatican.va, of which four have WP articles thus far.-<a href="" title="User:Choster">choster</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Choster">talk</a>) 05:07, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Keep</b> Clearly a short main article could be written, &#38; no doubt will be one day. The category seems highly likely to expand, given some of the editors we have. That the titles of all these things are in Latin, &#38; not very explanatory even if you understand them, is an argument for allowing fairly precise categories. There are better merge targets anyway, I think. <a href="" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Johnbod">talk</a>) 17:39, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li><b>&#60;s&#62;Strong keep&#60;/s&#62;</b> per Quatloo.  This is not categorisation by shared named: this a category for groups of defendants whose cases have become cause celebres. The mechanism used involves the <i>foo number</i> label, but the reason for the category is not the naming, its&#39; the fact that these cases are sufficiently controversial to have been given name. Take a look at the articles in this category: they are all cases where there has been a public campaign of support for the defendants, and Otto is entirely wrong to say that they these groups have nothing in common apart from the naming method.  --<a href="" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#996600; cursor: not-allowed;&#34;&#62;Brown&#60;/span&#62;HairedGirl</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 20:26, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I&#39;m still not seeing any evidence in support of the contention that the naming format including a number is either the subject of scholarly research, nor for the notion that numbering a group of defendants is done as a way to generate public sympathy or to denote that the defendant group has become a <i>cause celebré</i>. Certainly that isn&#39;t the case with one of the most notoriously mishandled defendant groups the <a href="" title="Scottsboro Boys">Scottsboro Boys</a> (although there has been what appears to be a somewhat PC-motivated effort to re-christen them the &#34;Scottsboro Nine&#34;, probably because of the issue of calling African American adult males &#34;boys&#34;). So the supposed bases for the category appear to be little more than speculation on the part of Wikipedia editors. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 17:55, 14 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Question</b>. Can anyone address Otto&#39;s concerns that have been put out there a couple of times now? I&#39;ve been wondering the same thing and have been waiting for someone to reply. Where is the evidence that numbering defendants in this way is done to generate public sympathy, or for any other consistent reason? To me it appears to just be a shorthand way the press begins to refer to groups of defendants because it&#39;s easy and it sounds cool—and if that&#39;s the case there is nothing inherent that connects the various groups and is just categorization by shared name feature, which is a classicly uncontroversial reason to delete. If someone could back up some of the claims being made, which at this point just appear to me to be guesses or surmises, then perhaps we&#39;d have some reason to keep. But without some sort of back up for these claims, this is just blowing smoke.  </li></ul>

<li>Please read the <a href="" title="Manifesto of the Sixteen">Manifesto of the Sixteen</a> article. These individuals are notable for being anarchist activists. Their association with the <i>Manifesto</i> led to furious backlash by their peers, completely dividing the European anarchist movement and leading them to be shunned for the rest of their lives. This is far more a defining characteristic than, say,   in the case of <a href="" title="Jean Grave">Jean Grave</a> or  /  in the case of <a href="" title="Peter Kropotkin">Peter Kropotkin</a>. These men are remembered for having betrayed the international anarchist movement by their signing of the <i>Manifesto</i>, not for these trivialities. Nor does the argument that a category <i>may be</i> redundant to a <i>potential</i> list carry any weight, as list/category redundancy has long been supported. Deletion is a last resort, and I see no effort whatsoever on the nominator&#39;s part to discuss this issue. &#60;font color=&#34;404040&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Skomorokh">&#60;font face=&#34;Goudy Old Style&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Skomorokh&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 02:51, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale: Delete.</b> In days past, a hell of a lot of people were accused of heresy—for a time, pretty much anyone who came up with an original thought that had the potential to upset the status quo was accused of heresy by <i>somebody</i>. Also, in the view of the medieval (Christian) Church, weren&#39;t pretty much <i>all</i> Jews said to be guilty of a kind of heresy just by nature of the fact that they continued to reject Jesus as the Messiah? I don&#39;t think we need  , much less this subcategory of Jewish people who were so accused. I can understand having  , but just being &#34;accused&#34; of it is probably not defining in most cases. The category also isn&#39;t clear on who has to have done the accusing. It it accusations of heresy from a <a href="" title="Christian heresy">Christian perspective</a> or a from a <a href="" title="Heresy in Orthodox Judaism">Jewish perspective</a>, or from either?

<li><b>Comment</b> - I am very skeptical of this category for all of the obvious reasons that have already been touched on. But I&#39;m wondering if there might <i>possibly</i> be a rationale for a category for people who have been <i>formally or officially accused of heresy</i> such, i.e. by a religious body or authority designated as having the power to do so -- if there is, in fact, any such thing.
