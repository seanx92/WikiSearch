<h1>Noddy's Toyland Adventures</h1>

<p> 
 
 </p>
<p><b><i>Noddy&#39;s Toyland Adventures</i></b> was a children&#39;s television programme that was broadcast from September 1992 until December 1994 and again from 1999 to 2001 on the BBC. It was produced by <a href="" title="Cosgrove Hall Films">Cosgrove Hall Films</a> and was produced and shown in stop-motion animation.</p>
<p>The show featured the most-memorable voice-acting talents of character voice-actors and television-writers <a href="" title="Jimmy Hibbert">Jimmy Hibbert</a> and <a href="" title="Susan Sheridan">Susan Sheridan</a> (both of whom also worked on BBC TV UK Version of <a href="" title="The Little Polar Bear">The Little Polar Bear</a> between 1994), with every episode of Noddy&#39;s Toyland Adventures being written by Julia &#38; Chris Allen respectively during its broadcast run.</p>
<p>It follows the adventures of Noddy a little wooden doll who lives in Toyland with his red and yellow taxi often trying to make sixpence or getting himself in trouble. His best friends Big Ears, Mr Plod and Tessie Bear are always ready to led a hand, especially when he gets tricked by Gobbo and Sly the wicked Goblins. Whatever the situation the episode mostly ends with Noddy laughing and nodding his head which makes the bell on his hat ring.</p>
<p>The show had some airtime in Canada and America as &#34;Noddy&#34; which featured the original segments redubbed with Canadian and American voices with live action segments that aired in between. The show was eventually moved back to the UK in 1999, this time as &#34;Noddy in Toyland&#34; (not to be confused with the 2009 show); it was decided to keep the original British voices, but the live action segments remained.</p>
