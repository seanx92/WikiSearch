<b>Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames</b> were a noted <a href="" title="British rhythm and blues">British rhythm and blues</a>/soul/jazz/ska/pop group of the 1960s. They had been the backing band for <a href="" title="Billy Fury">Billy Fury</a> but, after being dismissed at the end of 1961, their pianist <a href="" title="Georgie Fame">Georgie Fame</a> took over as vocalist and they went on to enjoy great success.</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Personnel">Personnel</span></h2>
<p>Georgie Fame, drummer Red Reece, bassist Tex Makins and guitarist Colin Green were rehearsing with singer Clay  Nicholls in 1961 when they were hired by <a href="" title="Larry Parnes">Larry Parnes</a> to back <a href="" title="Billy Fury">Billy Fury</a>. Green and  Fame (then Clive Powell) had first worked together in Colin Green&#39;s Beat Boys, who had accompanied <a href="" title="Gene Vincent">Gene Vincent</a> and <a href="" title="Eddie Cochran">Eddie Cochran</a> when in the UK. They were dismissed in February 1962 for being &#34;too jazzy&#34; for Fury, to be replaced by <a href="" title="The Tornados">The Tornados</a>, and Fame took over on vocals. Green left for a while, replaced first by Joe Moretti and then <a href="" title="John McLaughlin (musician)">John McLaughlin</a> who held the post until April 1963, when McLaughlin joined <a href="" title="The Graham Bond Organisation">The Graham Bond Organisation</a> and the band was without a guitarist until Green returned in October 1964. In that time Boots Slade had taken over on bass from Makins for some time while the latter toured with <a href="" title="Johnny Hallyday">Johnny Hallyday</a>.</p>
<p>Reece remained a constant until he became ill in 1964 after the group&#39;s second album appeared: he was followed by Tommy Frost and Roy Mills then <a href="" title="Jimmie Nicol">Jimmie Nicol</a>, who quickly left to replace <a href="" title="Ringo Starr">Ringo Starr</a> on <a href="" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>&#39; tour. <a href="" title="Phil Seamen">Phil Seamen</a> and <a href="" title="Micky Waller">Micky Waller</a> helped out until <a href="" title="Bill Eyden">Bill Eyden</a> was taken on in September 1964. Eyden and Makins remained as the group&#39;s rhythm section until the group&#39;s last line-up, when they were replaced in December 1965 by Cliff Barton and <a href="" title="Mitch Mitchell">Mitch Mitchell</a>: the group was augmented by <a href="" title="Ghana">Ghanaian</a> percussionist Neeomi &#34;Speedy&#34; Acquaye, who was with the band from May 1962 until shortly before it folded on the same day that Mitchell joined <a href="" title="The Jimi Hendrix Experience">The Jimi Hendrix Experience</a>.&#60;ref name=Maycock&#62;&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The Blue Flames always featured saxophones: Mick Eve joined in 1962 and left in July 1964, having been joined by Johnny Marshall and then, in 1964, Peter Coe. Coe remained, eventually joined by Glenn Hughes and then by <a href="" title="Eddie Thornton">Eddie &#34;Tan-Tan&#34; Thornton</a> (trumpet), who had for some time appeared occasionally with the group.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.reocities.com/SunsetStrip/Diner/2674/acquaye_speedy_a.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.reocities.com/SunsetStrip/Diner/2674/acquaye_speedy_a.htm">http://www.reocities.com/SunsetStrip/Diner/2674/acquaye_speedy_a.htm</a> - Chronology&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.billyfury.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.billyfury.com/">http://www.billyfury.com/</a> - Billy Fury - &#34;Backing groups&#34; July 2011&#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://colingreen.co.uk/Memories.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://colingreen.co.uk/Memories.htm">http://colingreen.co.uk/Memories.htm</a> - Colin Green Site July 2011&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

In August 1963 the band took a weekly Friday night spot at &#34;The Scene&#34; on <a href="" title="Great Windmill Street">Great Windmill Street</a> and they also performed at The Roaring Twenties club near <a href="" title="Carnaby Street">Carnaby Street</a>, run by Jamaican <a href="" title="DJ">DJ</a> Count Suckle.

I had been playing piano up to that point but I bought a Hammond organ the next day.&#34;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/rik-gunnell-454967.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/rik-gunnell-454967.html">Rik Gunnell, Club owner and impresario: obituary by Spencer Leigh at independent.co.uk</a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

It failed to appear on the charts, and first three singles, released in 1964, &#39;Do The Dog&#39;, &#39;Do Re Mi&#39;, and &#39;Bend A Little&#39;, also didn&#39;t go very far.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/georgie-fame-p4229/biography&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/georgie-fame-p4229/biography&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.allmusic.com/artist/georgie-fame-p4229/biography&#60;/ref&#62;</a>

Their version of the song &#34;<a href="" title="Yeh Yeh">Yeh Yeh</a>&#34;, a tune by <a href="" title="Mongo Santamaría">Mongo Santamaría</a> with lyrics by Jon Hendricks, released on 14 January 1965, spent two weeks at No. 1 on the UK singles chart and a total of 12 weeks on the chart.

<p>The follow-up &#34;In The Meantime&#34; (February 1965) only scraped the top twenty and the next two offerings were little heard. Then &#34;<a href="" title="Getaway (Georgie Fame song)">Getaway</a>&#34;, released on 21 July 1966, did very well&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0266600/bio&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0266600/bio&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0266600/bio&#60;/ref&#62;</a> reaching the top of the UK chart for a week and spending 11 weeks on the chart in all. The song, originally recorded with a view to using it as a television jingle for a petrol advertisement, was later used as the theme tune for a quiz show on Australian television. The two subsequent singles, &#34;Sunny&#34; and &#34;Sitting in the Park&#34; made number 13 and 12 respectively. At this point, after 1966&#39;s album <i>Sweet Thing</i> was released, Fame broke up the band, signed to CBS and went on to record solo,&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/georgie-fame-p4229/biography&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.allmusic.com/artist/georgie-fame-p4229/biography&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.allmusic.com/artist/georgie-fame-p4229/biography&#60;/ref&#62;</a> having been advised by his management to pursue an &#34;all-round entertainment&#34; career, somewhat as <a href="" title="Manfred Mann">Manfred Mann</a>&#39;s Paul Jones was then doing.</p>
<p>Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames were the only act from the UK invited to perform with the first <a href="" title="Tamla Motown">Motown</a> Review in the UK in the mid-1960s.
