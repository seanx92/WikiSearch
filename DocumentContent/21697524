<p> 
The following is a <b>list of characters</b> that appear in the American animated series <i><a href="" title="ThunderCats">ThunderCats</a></i>, its <a href="" title="ThunderCats (2011 TV series)">2011 reboot</a>, and its related media.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Original_ThunderCats">Original ThunderCats</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Jaga">Jaga</span></h4>
<p><b>Jaga</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Earl Hammond">Earl Hammond</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Corey Burton">Corey Burton</a> in the 2011 series) is also known as &#34;Jaga the Wise&#34; and is based on the <a href="" title="Jaguar">Jaguar</a>. This elder warrior was once regarded as the GREATEST OF ALL ThunderCats By Lion-O himself. An adviser and protector of the Lord’s family, Jaga wielded the &#34;Sword of Omens&#34; and was a formidable fighter in combat. After Claudus was blinded Jaga became the main guardian of the Eye of Thundera, the Sword of Omens, and the Treasure of Thundera. It was Jaga who gathered the nobles of the ThunderCats to escort Lion-O and the Eye of Thundera to safety, but did not survive the trip to Third Earth as he volunteered to pilot the damaged ship while the others slept. Because of this, Jaga died of old age. However, Jaga does reappear on Third Earth as a ghost (seen only by Lion-O at first) to guide him in his lessons and adventures. At times, he appears before the other ThunderCats as well such as when facing down Grune the Destroyer&#39;s ghost and when the ThunderCats need to rescue their fellow Thunderians. Jaga&#39;s physical body does reappear at one point during the original series in the episode &#34;The Astral Prison&#34; where he was trapped in another dimension, prompting Lion-O to travel there to rescue him from being held captive by an evil inhabitant of said dimension. His fate as a physical living entity after this was never revealed, but his spirit form continued to appear throughout the series.</p> 
<p>In the 2011 series, Jaga serves as head of Thundera&#39;s <a href="" title="Clergy">cleric</a> warriors, possessing a knowledge of ancient secrets, superhuman speed, projecting lightning from his staff. In his prime, he used the &#34;Sword of Omens&#34; in an epic duel against Ratilla. At the start of the series, Jaga sacrifices himself to ensure Lion-O and his group escape. This resulted with him being tortured into revealing the location of the &#34;Book of Omens&#34; to Mumm-Ra, though doing his best to resist the villain&#39;s magic when sealed within a lantern, eventually his free will wavers along with his physical form. Though Jaga destroys the lantern that was keeping his soul intact to save Lion-O from Mumm-Ra, his soul took residence within the Book of Omens and becomes Lion-O&#39;s guide. In the 2-part &#34;The Trials of Lion-O&#34; Pt. 1, Lion-O encounters Jaga in the entrance to the Spirit World. Jaga tells Lion-O of the challenges he must undergo to gain a second chance in life. But when he failed the final test, Jaga allows Lion-O to return to the living long enough to save the other ThunderCats though it would exile the king&#39;s soul to Limbo by sunrise. However, once saving his friends, Lion-O learns from Jaga that it was actually a test like the other challenges and allows Lion-O to remain among the living.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lion-O">Lion-O</span></h4>
<p> 
<b>Lion-O</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Larry Kenney">Larry Kenney</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Will Friedle">Will Friedle</a> in the 2011 series)&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;autogenerated1&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; is the leader and the hereditary &#34;Lord of the ThunderCats.&#34;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Lion-O, based on the <a href="" title="lion">lion</a>, wields the legendary Sword of Omens, which is able to fire bolts of energy and allows Lion-O to see across great distances with its power of &#34;Sight Beyond Sight&#34;, as well as the Claw Shield, a gauntlet that launches grappling lines from its claws. A mere child of twelve years old at the time of Thundera&#39;s destruction, Lion-O aged to adulthood during the trip to Third Earth when his suspension capsule failed to prevent him from aging too much. Although cunning and skillful, he is truly a child in a man&#39;s body, and throughout the series, must learn what it takes to become a true leader and gain true maturity.</p>
<p>In the latter half of the show&#39;s first season, Lion-O has to put all that he has learned to use in the &#34;Anointment Trials,&#34; which consist of contests of strength, speed, cunning, and intelligence (this last is referred to as &#34;mind-power&#34; in the story arc) against each of the other ThunderCats. (Complicating matters for Lion-O is the fact that he is required to be unarmed for the contests; moreover, the other ThunderCats are not permitted to assist him. The Mutants attempt, but ultimately without success, to take advantage of this last in an effort to leave the ThunderCats leaderless). Ultimately triumphing over Mumm-Ra in a final battle (&#34;The Trial Of Evil&#34;) in the heart of the villain&#39;s pyramid in which he discovers that Mumm-Ra, like any Egyptian mummy, is dependent upon his <a href="" title="sarcophagus">sarcophagus</a>, Lion-O is crowned the true Lord of the ThunderCats in a grand <a href="" title="Inauguration">inaugural</a> ceremony attended by nearly every inhabitant of Third Earth. It is also hinted that he has romantic feelings for Cheetara, Willa, and Mandora.</p>
<p>In the 2011 version, Lion-O is a misunderstood teenager instead of being a boy inside an adult body. Lion-O can also be a bit of a hothead but is by far the most patient and understanding Cat next to Cheetara. He is the only one at the beginning who believes that technology and Mumm-Ra exist even though technology is sold across Third Earth. Lion-O believes that the other races of Third Earth should be treated equal as seen when Lion-O was defending two persecuted Lizards from some Thunderians until Claudus broke up the fight. After Claudus was killed by Mumm-Ra, Lion-O becomes the new Lord of the ThunderCats. His catchphrase is <i>&#34;Whiskers!&#34;</i> whenever he finds himself in a bad situation. In &#34;Legacy,&#34; it is revealed that Lion-O had an ancestor named Leo who played a part in the defeat of Mumm-Ra. Lion-O&#39;s weapons are the Sword of Omens and the Claw Shield. It is shown that Lion-O had feelings for Cheetara until in &#34;Between Brothers&#34; when she confessed her feelings for Tygra. In &#34;Native Son,&#34; it&#39;s shown that Lion-O had an unnamed mother who died giving birth to him. In <i>Recipe for Disaster</i> it&#39;s shown that Lion-O had attempted to work through his relationship issues with Cheetara by pursuing Pumyra, trying multiple times to court her, all of which ended in disaster. However after saving her from Mumm-Ra yet again she gives him a kiss on the cheek in thanks. However, in &#34;What Lies Above Part 2,&#34; the feeling was revealed to be an act as she reveals her loyalty and love to Mumm-Ra and only toyed with Lion-O&#39;s emotions to further her advantage.</p>
<p>Lion-O is renamed <i>León-O</i> in the Spanish version, <i>Leo</i> in the German version, <i>Starlion</i> in the French version, and <i>Lion</i> in the Brazilian version.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Tygra">Tygra</span></h4>

<p> </p>
<p><b>Tygra</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Peter Newman (actor)">Peter Newman</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Matthew Mercer">Matthew Mercer</a> in the 2011 series) is a  staunch, level-headed warrior based on the <a href="" title="tiger">tiger</a>, Tygra is known as the ThunderCat architect and scientist.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; He is the one Lion-O often turns to as second-in-command and for counsel. He is responsible for the design of all of the ThunderCat structures on Third Earth — the Cat’s Lair and the Tower of Omens. He is also gifted with &#34;mind-power&#34; — the ability to create lifelike illusions in other people’s minds; he used this for Lion-O’s Anointment Trial, but it puts a great strain on him. He uses a whip-like <a href="" title="bolas">bolas</a> in combat, with which he can render himself invisible to the naked eye. In the episode &#34;All That Glitters,&#34; Lion-O instructs Tygra, &#34;If I do not return, you will be the new Lord of the ThunderCats.&#34;  This verifies that indeed, Tygra is the second-in-command. Tygra&#39;s weakness is that he is not able to swim when not invisible; also, Tygra has shown to be easily influenced by external stimuli more than any other ThunderCat (&#34;The Garden of Delights&#34;, &#34;Turgamar the Tuska&#34; and &#34;Crystal Canyon&#34;); he also claimed to be shy when being a kid. Patient, analytic and calm, Tygra is the most quiet ThunderCat, and usually considers every part of the problem before making a decision. Where creators Ted Wolf and <a href="" title="Leonard Starr">Leonard Starr</a> described Panthro&#39;s character as being based on &#34;strength&#34; and Cheetara&#39;s character as being based on &#34;speed,&#34; Tygra&#39;s character was described as being based on &#34;integrity.&#34; 
A common misconception amongst certain fans is that Tygra and Cheetara were a romantic item in the original series. Factually, no pairings were ever established. It also bears noting that in the last season of the original series, Tygra and Pumyra remained on Third Earth while the remainder of the Thundercats established themselves on New Thundera.
In the WildStorm/Dc comic mini-series, Tygra marries Cheetara after the two are raped by mutants over the course of some years and Cheetara ends her unexplained relationship with Panthro. Eventually, the two raise a pair of twin cubs.</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, the character is the adopted older brother of Lion-O. A flirtatious ladies man, Tygra possesses extreme xenophobia, a jealous streak, and an inferiority complex. All of which often serve to cause friction between himself and Lion-O. As he would learn later in the season, Tygra is of the Tiger Clan who were forced to live far from Thundera due to their continued loyalty to Mumm-Ra even after his entrapment. Sent to Thundera as a baby by his biological father Javan, Tygra was raised by Claudus and his wife with the latter loving Tygra dearly prior to her death while giving birth to Lion-O. Losing both the right to succeed his foster father and the only mother he knew, Tygra grew to hate Lion-O and questioning the latter&#39;s decisions after he became the new Lord of the ThunderCats. Furthermore, Tygra fell in love with Cheetara when they first met as children in the past, although he believed she never returned his feelings for her. Her apparent friendship with Lion-O gave him another reason to bear a grudge on his brother. Tygra and Cheetara eventually become a couple after confessing their feelings for each other. Soon after, Tygra meets his birth father and inherits his whip. In &#34;What Lies Above&#34; he is explained to be a natural pilot able to fly any craft without any training at all due to his ancestors serving as pilots.</p>
<p>Tygra is renamed <i>Tigro</i> in the Spanish, German and French versions.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Panthro">Panthro</span></h4>
<p><b>Panthro</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Earle Hyman">Earle Hyman</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Kevin Michael Richardson">Kevin Michael Richardson</a>&#60;ref name=&#34;autogenerated1&#34;/&#62; in the 2011 series) is the next noble and greatest warrior after Jaga, and based on the <a href="" title="Black panther">panther</a>.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Even though a warrior in all forms of ThunderCats martial arts fighting, Panthro has a brilliant mind, which he uses as the chief mechanic/engineer and pilot for the ThunderCats. He is also physically the strongest and is a cunning warrior in combat, relying as much on martial arts as on physical strength. With Tygra’s help, he builds all of the vehicles the ThunderCats use on Third Earth — including the ThunderTank, the Feliner and the ThunderClaw, ThunderStrike, and HoverCat. Panthro is a complex ThunderCat. On the one hand he has great passion, love of family, and life. With an infectious laugh, accompanied by a good sense of humor. On the other hand, he is a stone cold warrior. He lives by the ThunderCats warrior code. Pride, excellence, and loyalty are a hallmark of what makes Panthro tick. Because of his passion he is known to lose his patience with other ThunderCats. On the field of battle, however, he is cool, calm and collected, although he has a phobia of <a href="" title="bat">bats</a>. Because of this, Panthro has gained respect both from friends and enemies alike. They respect the king, but fear the panther. In combat, he uses a pair of <i><a href="" title="nunchaku">nunchaku</a></i> with open-away cat-paws, which house several chemical spray-compounds, and objects such as ball bearings, that he can use against foes. The spikes on his chest bands can be used like projectile weapons or as rappelling lines.</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, Panthro is one of Claudus&#39; more loyal soldiers who was sent with his friend Grune to find the Book of Omens. Their attempted search resulted with Mumm-Ra&#39;s release and Grune betraying Panthro, who while fighting Grune fell down an abyss and seemingly was killed. However, Panthro survived and constructed the ThunderTank, which he later used to save Lion-O&#39;s group from Slythe&#39;s platoon. Though he questioned Lion-O&#39;s ability to lead, Panthro eventually accepted him as the new king. Unlike the rest of the ThunderCats, he never learned how to swim.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; In &#34;Between Brothers,&#34; Panthro duels with Grune when he and Slithe attack the Elephants&#39; village against Mumm-Ra&#39;s orders. Panthro loses most of his arms while trapping Grune in the astral plane. He was later outfitted with mechanical arms built by the Berbils which can also elongate themselves. In &#34;The Pit,&#34; it was revealed that he was an old friend of Dobo back when they were slaves in a gladiator arena called The Pit which was located in a city that is inhabited by Dogs. Panthro later escaped the Pit when it turned out that the match the next day would be a death match. This caused Dobo to feel bitter towards Panthro, until Panthro revealed the death match would pit him and Dobo against each other.  In &#34;What Lies Above&#34; it is revealed Panthro is afriad of heights, which he finds out during the Feliner&#39;s first flight.</p>
<p>Panthro is renamed <i>Pantro</i> in the Spanish and German versions, <i>Pantéro</i> in the French version.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Cheetara">Cheetara</span></h4>
<p><b>Cheetara</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Lynne Lipton">Lynne Lipton</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Emmanuelle Chriqui">Emmanuelle Chriqui</a>&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://collider.com/emmanuelle-chriqui-interview-elektra-luxx-tron-uprising/79562/" rel="nofollow" title="http://collider.com/emmanuelle-chriqui-interview-elektra-luxx-tron-uprising/79562/">Emmanuelle Chriqui Interview ELEKTRA LUXX, ENTOURAGE and TRON: UPRISING</a>&#60;/ref&#62; and <a href="" title="Grey DeLisle">Grey DeLisle</a> (young) in the 2011 series) is a female warrior, based on the <a href="" title="cheetah">cheetah</a>. She is the only adult female ThunderCat until the later appearance of Pumyra. She is as lovely as she is brave and caring. Often a voice of reason, she is also the bearer of a budding &#34;sixth sense,&#34; detecting when something is unsafe or if evil is near. This precognitive sense, which Cheetara regards as a curse for the most part, also allows her to perceive visions — whether involuntary or by forcing herself — but can leave her very weak; she may require days to regain her strength. She has incredible speed, once clocked at 120 m.p.h. on a morning jog. She can maintain this speed only for brief periods, but with it, she is very fast in combat. Her weapon of choice is a <a href="" title="bo staff">bo staff</a> that can grow or shrink to variable lengths. When not in use, it is attached to her left armband. As revealed in the comics, besides being the prettiest of the ThunderCats, Cheetara is by far the best swimmer among them; in fact, she alone does not mind getting wet from time to time; on at least one occasion, she remarked, &#34;I&#39;ll never understand why the other &#39;Cats don&#39;t like the water.&#34; Cheetara goes through multiple relationships through the comic series starting with Panthro and ending with Tygra. Eventually, she and Tygra raise two children.</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, Cheetara is one of the last remaining cleric warriors. When she originally tried to join the Order of Clerics as a child, she was initially turned down by Jaga, because even though she had the speed possessed by clerics, she lacked the patience. Despite being turned down, Cheetara decided to show Jaga she had the patience needed to become a cleric, and began to wait in front of the Order&#39;s doors. While waiting, she was given a flower by Tygra, which helped Cheetara sustain herself, until Jaga finally allowed her to join the clerics. In the aftermath of Thundera&#39;s downfall, Cheetara&#39;s possibly the sole surviving member of the Order, other than Jaga, who lives on in spirit form. Cheetara initially served as counselor to Lion-O, since she never shunned him for his interest in technology and initially seems to support his kindness to other races. During the first half of the first season, both Tygra and Lion-O had a crush on her, but in the end she chose Tygra, due to the kindness Tygra had shown her when they were young. This in turn results in Cheetara abandoning her Cleric duties from &#34;New Alliances&#34; onward.</p>
<p>Cheetara is renamed <i>Chitara</i> in the Spanish version, <i>Geparda</i> in the German version, <i>Félibelle</i> in the French version.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="WilyKit_and_WilyKat">WilyKit and WilyKat</span></h4>
<p><b>WilyKit</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Lynne Lipton">Lynne Lipton</a> in original series, <a href="" title="Madeleine Hall">Madeleine Hall</a> in the 2011 series) and <b>WilyKat</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Peter Newman (actor)">Peter Newman</a> in original series, <a href="" title="Eamon Pirruccello">Eamon Pirruccello</a> in the 2011 series) are twin siblings, Kat being the older brother and Kit as the younger sister where both of them are based on the <a href="" title="wildcat">wildcat</a>; they are technically and jointly referred to by the others as &#34;ThunderKittens,&#34; although technically they are older than Lion-O. They are the mischief-makers, and often have their own lessons to learn alongside Lion-O while they live on Third Earth, where they frequently use tricks and traps to combat evil. Kit is the more adventurous, while the older Kat usually errs on the side of caution. Kit also appears to be the more agile, and at times, she employs a rolling-attack against the enemy. Their agility is often displayed when they ride their &#34;space boards&#34; — specially designed flying devices shaped like Earth surfboards that can carry them over long distances. Each uses special capsules, balls and other gimmick weapons carried in pouches and on their belts. They sometimes use slingshots to fire these at the Mutants or other foes. They also carry trick lariats, with which they can either tangle and ensnare foes, or use to pull themselves out of danger. In the first episode, they appeared to be slightly older than Lion-O, but when they went into suspended animation, they did not age as far in their suspension capsules as Lion-O did in his.</p>
<p>In the 2011 version, they are younger in age and were originally from a middle-class family in the countryside living with their mother, their father, and their two siblings. When the two lost their father to a <a href="" title="tornado">tornado</a> with the family becoming more down-trodden, the twins resolve to run away from home to find the lost city of <a href="" title="El Dorado">El Dara</a> and become rich. However, upon arriving to Thundera, they were forced to become <a href="" title="Street children">street urchins</a> and lock-picking <a href="" title="pickpockets">pickpockets</a> in order to survive the slums with their aspirations the only thing keeping them going. When the Lizards attack Thundera, the two manage to escape during the chaos before eventually teaming up with the ThunderCats on their journey. In this version, WilyKit and WilyKat have tails, which none of the main adult ThunderCats except Panthro possess (how Panthro lost his in never shown nor explained), and visible external ears. Like in the original series, WilyKat possess gimmick weapons with his usual weapon being a grappling hook called a Flick. WilyKit also possesses a special instrumental  called a Flupe that she uses to play a soothing melody that their mother used to hum to the siblings, able to put anyone in a hypnotic trance. During her time with the elephants, learning to use her flute to shatter boulders when in tune with the elephant&#39;s trumpets. Over the course of the first half in season one, Wilykit gained a spiritual outlook on life as she and her brother become more involved in their adult companions&#39; fight. This new outlook allowed the youth to assume Cheetara&#39;s abandoned role of Cleric, encouraging Lion-O when he needs it the most. In the second half, the twins acquire hover boards from the Berbils and later the Forever Bag, a magic bag previous thieves possessed that has an infinite storage space.</p>
<p>WilyKit and WilyKat are renamed <i>Felina y Felino</i> in the Spanish version (except in the 2011 version, where they retain their original names), and <i>MiniKit und MiniKat</i> in the German version.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="ThunderCats_who_appeared_later_in_the_series">ThunderCats who appeared later in the series</span></h3>
<p>At the start of the series&#39; second season, it was revealed to Lion-O (after having a recurring <a href="" title="dream">dream</a> about the final moments of the destruction of Thundera) that there are three more Thunderians living on Third Earth. They survived the cataclysm when rescued by a Ro-Bear Berbil scout ship piloted by two Berbils. The ship was damaged in the final explosion of the planet and made it to Third Earth landing on an unknown island somewhere in the northern sea. This was revealed to Lion-O when Cheetara focuses her powers into tapping into this knowledge.</p>
<p>After Mumm-Ra tries to capture them to use as bait to destroy the ThunderCats at Firerock Mountain (which is where a lot of Thundrainium is located), these three Thunderians are rescued and brought back to the Cat’s Lair, where Lion-O anoints them as new ThunderCats. They initially come to live in Cat&#39;s Lair until after the arrival of the Lunataks, at which time they are stationed at the Tower of Omens.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Lynx-O">Lynx-O</span></h4>
<p><b>Lynx-O</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Doug Preis">Doug Preis</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Kevin Michael Richardson">Kevin Michael Richardson</a> in the 2011 version) is the oldest of the trio who is based on the <a href="" title="lynx">lynx</a>. Lynx-O was spared the sight of the destruction of their homeworld by a cruel twist of fate: a blast of intense heat and fire blinded him moments before he and his two younger companions were rescued, leaving his eyes red denoting blindness. Because of this injury, Lynx-O has had to adapt to survive on Third Earth, and has done so by honing his other senses to super-human levels. His sense of touch, smell, taste and hearing are far above those of the other ThunderCats, and this affords him a type of &#34;sixth sense,&#34; though it is not like the one Cheetara possesses. Though blind, Lynx-O is still a formidable fighter. His sense of touch allows him to find pressure points on a foe’s body to knock them off balance or stun them. He can also feel vibrations, which allow him to evade attacks and capture, and can use a Sonic Reflector as a weapon in combat. His greatest skill comes in utilizing a special &#34;<a href="" title="braille">braille</a> board&#34; — a device that allows him to translate information coming from sensor systems inside the Tower of Omens, enabling him to see into the gloom of Dark Side. This same device also allows him to pilot the ThunderStrike aircraft through the Valley of Mists when the ThunderCats need to find a way through to Dark Side.</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, Lynx-O is a general under Claudus. He first made a cameo as one of Thundera&#39;s lookout sentries. It is unknown as to whether or not he survived Thundera&#39;s destruction.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Bengali">Bengali</span></h4>
<p><b>Bengali</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Peter Newman (actor)">Peter Newman</a>) is one of the two younger Thundereans among the trio, named after the <a href="" title="bengal tiger">bengal tiger</a> and resembling the <a href="" title="white tiger">white variant</a>. This warrior is a skilled <a href="" title="blacksmith">blacksmith</a> like his father before him. This talent proves valuable after the Sword of Omens is once again broken. Fast and agile like Tygra, Bengali is called &#34;brother&#34; by him, but it is unclear if they share a true familial bond or if the greeting is merely meant as a term of endearment (given that the new ThunderCats repeatedly call the originals &#34;Nobles&#34; while referring to themselves as &#34;mere Thunderians,&#34; it seems unlikely that there is any family relationship between the two). Another possibility is that because they are both tigers, the Ben-Gal clan may be cousins to the Tygra clan, even though one is considered nobility while the other is not. In combat, Bengali wields a weapon called the Hammer of Thundera (which he also uses when doing blacksmith-related work). It can shoot energy blasts, and carries smoke pellets in its handle, to allow him to cause confusion and provide cover for withdrawal from a fight.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Pumyra">Pumyra</span></h4>
<p><b>Pumyra</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Gerrianne Raphael">Gerrianne Raphael</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Pamela Adlon">Pamela Adlon</a> in the 2011 series) is another female Thunderian along with Cheetara and WilyKit. This young woman who is based on the <a href="" title="Cougar">puma</a> is a talented healer and medic. She uses her knowledge of Thunderian medicine, combined with the wide range of medicinal supplies to be found on Third Earth, to help heal and cure her fellow ThunderCats. Her compassionate nature lends to offering an alternative perspective, solving problems or conflict without fighting by using compromise and understanding. Possibly the most agile ThunderCat next to the ThunderKittens, Pumyra employs an incredible leaping ability — often able to vault higher than even great jumpers like Tygra or the ThunderKittens. She was also shown to be able to move in short bursts of super-speed (while moving fast she resembled a flash of lightning darting from place to place). In combat, she uses a special whipcord, which resembles a &#34;cat’s tail,&#34; that can launch special pellets and spheres like an ancient sling. Pumyra&#39;s role gradually decreased after her role in the first two movies. The only episode to focus on Pumyra was &#34;Mumm-Rana&#39;s Belt&#34; where she helps to regain Mumm-Rana&#39;s belt after it was stolen by Luna. In &#34;The Return to Thundera Part IV,&#34; she and Tygra stay behind on Third Earth in order to continue protecting the planet from danger.</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, Pumyra is portrayed as the female version of Tygra, having the same attitude, outlook, and opinions as the male. Pumyra originally fought during the fall of Thundera before being wounded and left to die under rubble. In her final moments, Pumyra died disillusioned, hateful, and resentful towards Lion-O and company for leaving Thundera while they failed to hear her pleas. Sensing her hate, Mumm-Ra resurrected Pumyra to serve him as his spy, placing her among the captive Thunderian slaves to be sold to Dobo. From there, meeting Lion-O and managing to keep her need for revenge in check when she is unable to finish off Lion-O, Pumyra earns his trust and love while serving as a beacon for Mumm-Ra to regain the Sword of Plun-Darr and track the Thundercats&#39; movement. It was by during the siege of Avista that Pumyra reveals her true colors by giving the Tech Stone to Mumm-Ra. After taking a hit from Ro-Bear Bill and Dobo, Pumyra leaves with Mumm-Ra promising to kill Lion-O the next time they meet.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="On_Thundera">On Thundera</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Claudus">Claudus</span></h4>
<p><b>Claudus</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Earl Hammond">Earl Hammond</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Larry Kenney">Larry Kenney</a> in the 2011 series) is the previous Lord of the ThunderCats and Lion-O&#39;s father. Claudus ruled Thundera before its destruction. He lost his sight during a war he fought against the mutants of Plun-Darr. In the episode &#34;Return to Thundera,&#34; Lion-O is transported back in time to Thundera the day before it was destroyed. He later rescued his father from past versions of Slithe and Vultureman (who were attempting to recover plans for a War-Bot that had fallen into the hands of Claudus&#39; spies). He then proceeded to give these plans to Lion-O, who used them in the present to destroy the mutants&#39; War-Bot. Believed to have died on Thundera while assisting the royal flagship in taking off, he was later found to have been captured by the Shadowmaster. Through a sequence of nightmares, Lion-O eventually learns from Jaga of his father&#39;s imprisonment in the Shadow Realm and is able to rescue him. Claudus is currently with Jaga in the afterlife.</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, Claudus is a stern father to Lion-O and the adoptive father of Tygra. He had a wife who died giving birth to Lion-O. When Grune and Panthro had fought bravely to get promoted to general, Claudus told them that he has given the job to Lynx-O. He was the one who sent Panthro and Grune to find the Book of Omens. When Lion-O was fighting off some Thunderians who were beating up two imprisoned Lizards (where Lion-O was assisted by Tygra and Cheetara), Claudus arrived to break up the fight. He was convinced by Lion-O to let the Lizards go free and back to their homeland. When Thundera was being attacked by the Lizards, Claudus is murdered by Mumm-Ra (who had assumed Panthro&#39;s form). Lion-O, Cheetara, and Tygra later hold a funeral pyre for him after escaping with the Sword of Omens.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Thunderians">Thunderians</span></h4>
 
<p>The Thunderians are the inhabitants of the planet Thundera which includes the heroic ThunderCats. The inhabitants of the planet have varying levels of cat-like traits that separate the different Thunderians into different types ranging from Jaguar, Lion, Tiger, Panther, Cheetah, Wildcat, Lynx, Puma, and Smilodon-type Thunderians. When Thundera is on the verge of destruction, Jaga got the nobles of the Thunderians to help get Lion-O onto the spaceship and off Thundera. There were some other survivors of Thundera&#39;s destruction as revealed in the five-part episode &#34;ThunderCats HO!&#34; where it was shown that the Thunderians Lynx-O, Bengali, and Pumyra were rescued by two Berbils in their ship which crashlanded on an island on Third Earth. After Thundera was recreated by Mumm-Ra when he was looking for the Sword of Plun-Darr, the Thunderians have been returning to Thundera one by one.</p> 
<p>In the 2011 series, the Thunderians (referred to as the Cats) were among the creatures who once served Mumm-Ra. This version&#39;s depiction of the Thunderians had them with clawed feet with spat-like coverings on them. Mumm-Ra found the Thunderians useful where they were given the authorities over the other Animals. This came to an end when Leo led in the rebellion which led to Mumm-Ra&#39;s imprisonment and his pyramid crashing onto Third Earth. The surviving Thunderians led by Leo rebuilt their civilization on Third Earth while the Book of Omens was hidden to keep it from falling into the wrong hands, having kept the Eye of Thundra while entrusting the other three stones to the other animal races. Over the past centuries, the Thunderian Empire grew into a bountiful civilization through its army and magic-using clerics. However, these advances made them too powerful to the point that other races began to express envious malice towards them while the Thunderians pit the lesser races against each other. Two known races to bare that grudge were the Rats (who were becoming equals to the Thunderians prior to their leader Ratilla&#39;s death by Jaga&#39;s hand) and the Lizards (who were heavily outmatched in the Lizard War). With Grune&#39;s aid, Mumm-Ra gives Slithe and the Lizards technology so they can raze Thundera to the ground. The resulting attack ended up having Mumm-Ra killing Claudus and capturing Jaga. While Lion-O escapes with Tygra and Cheetara, Wilykit and Wilykat (who joined Lion-O group&#39;s) are among the only non-royal Thunderians to survive. As revealed in &#34;The Pit&#34; and &#34;Curse of Ratilla&#34; with Pumyra among them, the survivors are sold as slaves to the Rats under Ratilla&#39;s heir Ratar-O. After Lion-O defeated Ratar-O, the Thunderian slaves were freed and Lion-O told them to take refuge in the ruins of Thundera.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Leo</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Will Friedle">Will Friedle</a> in the first appearance, <a href="" title="Jason Marsden">Jason Marsden</a> in the second appearance) - Exclusive to the 2011 series, Leo was Lion-O&#39;s direct ancestor and Mumm-Ra&#39;s right hand. Leo originally believed in Mumm-Ra&#39;s ideals for order across the cosmos prior to witnessing the death of the Plun-Darr galaxy. Deciding to engineer a rebellion, Leo gathered the scrapes from what remained from the creation of the Sword of Plun-Darr to create the Sword of Omens to defeat Mumm-Ra. In the aftermath of the Black Pyramid&#39;s descent to Third Earth, the Stones of Power taken from Mumm-Ra were split amongst the major races of Third earth with Leo keeping the War Stone with the Cats as the Eye of Thundera.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Panthera</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Cree Summer">Cree Summer</a>) - Exclusive to the 2011 series, Panthera was a Thunderian based on a <a href="" title="black panther">panther</a> who was among the Thunderians that worked for Mumm-Ra. Being the voice of reason to Leo, she tried to convince him that Mumm-Ra&#39;s methods of destruction do not match his goals. It was only after the death of the Plun-Darr galaxy that Panthera aids Leo in planning a resistance against Mumm-Ra. Her fate after the Black Pyramid&#39;s descent to Third Earth is unknown (although, given that she and Leo were implied to be a couple, it&#39;s possible that she married him and is also Lion-O&#39;s ancestor).</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Javan</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Robin Atkin Downes">Robin Atkin Downes</a>) - Exclusive to the 2011 series, Javan is a Thunderian based on the <a href="" title="Javan tiger">Javan tiger</a> and is the biological father of Tygra. His ancestors were shunned by the other Thunderians as the Tiger clan branch of the Thunderians were still loyal to Mumm-Ra. When his kin was inflicted with a plague, Javan choose not to turn to Thundera for aid and instead invoke the power of the Ancient Spirits of Evil to save his people. But once learning their price for their survival is the death of his newborn son Tigra, Javan couldn&#39;t bring himself to sacrifice the infant to honor their pact and send him away. As a result, the Ancient Spirits not only allowed Javan and his people to die out from the plague, but also bound their souls to the living world as cursed shape-shifting shadow monsters. Many years later while he and Lion-O were in the mountains, Tygra came across his ancestral home and meets Javan, expressing discontent towards the father who abandoned him. It was only later that Lion-O learned the truth of the curse as Javan tells him not to tell Tygra and get him away from the village before the sun sets. However, upon learning that Caspin and some of his court are going to kill his son, Javan fends them off before the curse takes effect and he mindlessly attacks Tygra. However, Tygra&#39;s act of humility broke the curse so both Javan and his kin are able to pass on to the next life. Tygra then inherits his father&#39;s whip.
<ul>
<li><b>Caspin</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Jim Cummings">Jim Cummings</a>) - Exclusive to the 2011 series, Caspin is a Thunderian based on the <a href="" title="Caspian tiger">Caspian tiger</a>. He is among the tiger-based Thunderians that live in the mountains and serves their leader Javan as his right-hand Cat. When Lion-O and Tygra came across the Tiger Clan&#39;s cave, Caspin saw an opportunity to end his people&#39;s curse as he and his conspirators decided to kill Tygra themselves. However, Javan comes to Tygra&#39;s aid and was forced to kill Caspin in self-defense stating that it didn&#39;t have to be this way. Before dying, Caspin told Javan that it had to be this way since it was Javan&#39;s fault that the entire Tiger Clan was cursed. But as the curse is broken and the Tiger Clan was revealed to have already died long ago, Caspin&#39;s sprit body faded away.</li></ul></li></ul>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Snarfs">The Snarfs</span></h2>
<p>The <b>Snarfs</b> are a race of intelligent <a href="" title="cat">cat</a>-like creatures that are plump, fuzzy and kind. Snarfs are native to Thundera, living in the Valley of Snarfs, and many of their number act as servants to Thunderean nobility, happily working as cooks, nursemaids, squires and so forth. When Thundera was destroyed, forty-nine Snarfs were able to commandeer a Mutant tanker and made their way to an uninhabited planet which they took as their own, dubbing it the &#34;Planet of Snarfs&#34;. Later, when Mumm-Ra recreated Thundera, he captured the Snarfs and brought them back to their home planet, putting them to work searching for the Treasure of Thundera. Subsequently liberated by the ThunderCats, the Snarfs returned to living happily on Thundera.</p>
<p>Snarfs are the only creatures in the Universe incapable of evil (except while possessed), although in episode 105, Snarf becomes corrupt with the power to control the other ThunderCats. Quick and clever, a Snarf is a loyal friend, though their small size often makes them a target for Mutants or other evil creatures. The Snarfs have proved to be valuable allies to the ThunderCats in times of peril. Though their fighting skills are more than wanting, the Snarfs have an inherent invulnerability/resistance to many (but not all) forms of magic and mind-control. This ability has enabled the Snarfs to save the other ThunderCats on several occasions. Snarfs are known to end their sentences with the squeaking exclamation for which they are named - &#34;snarf, snarf!&#34;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Snarf">Snarf</span></h3>
<p> 
<b>Snarf</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Bob McFadden">Bob McFadden</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Satomi Kōrogi">Satomi Kōrogi</a> in the 2011 series) is an elder Snarf, properly known by his name Osbert, which he hates. Snarf served as a nursemaid and <a href="" title="legal guardian">protector</a> for Lion-O when he was a boy.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;  After Lion-O grew up, Snarf found that often Lion-O did not want to have him &#34;mothering&#34; or protecting him. Still, Snarf has remained loyal to Lion-O and the other ThunderCats.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; At times, he does come through in a pinch with an idea and takes action when it is needed. Despite his age, he does keep up with the others. Even though not a fighter by skill or nature, Snarf is very agile (he boasts he can outplay anyone at tailbail or kick-the-bucket). He also can communicate with other animals on Third Earth to enlist their help in his tasks, and once even tricked the Ancient Spirits of Evil into giving him a power-up to become a being called Snarf-Ra.</p>
<p>In the 2011 version, Snarf is more of a <a href="" title="pet">pet</a> to Lion-O and does not speak English but can make animal sounds (though it seems Lion-O can still understand him). In later episodes, he goes &#34;Snarf&#34;.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Snarfer">Snarfer</span></h3>
<p><b>Snarfer</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Bob McFadden">Bob McFadden</a>) is a young and excitable Snarf who is Snarf’s young nephew. He was thought lost when Thundera exploded, but was one of the surviving Snarfs that made it to the Planet of Snarfs. Slightly more aggressive than his uncle, Snarfer is a keen mechanic and pilot in his own right, having been educated at &#34;Snarf College&#34; while majoring in Snarf-Studies (Snarf once said he was a &#34;college boy&#34;). He does tend to babble when over-excited, but at times he can be just as level-headed as Tygra. Though smaller than Snarf, he does not allow that to get in his way when he wants to help friends. It was through him that the ThunderCats learned, much to their surprise, that Snarf&#39;s real name was Osbert—and that he hated the name.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Snarf_Oswald_and_Snarf_Eggbert">Snarf Oswald and Snarf Eggbert</span></h3>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Robear_Berbils">The Robear Berbils</span></h3>
<p><b>The Robear Berbils</b> are partly furred robot-<a href="" title="bear">bears</a> from the planet Ro-Bear.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Because their homeworld is so tiny, they must form other colonies on distant worlds to survive. Small and harmless-looking, the Berbils are steadfast, hardy workers and skilled farmers, cooks and craftsmen. It was thanks to them that Tygra was able to build Cat’s Lair — and later the Tower of Omens — so quickly. Apparently, the Robear Berbils are <a href="" title="Cyborg">Cybernetic organisms</a>, as they are able to eat and digest organic food. <b>Robear Bill</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Earl Hammond">Earl Hammond</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Dee Bradley Baker">Dee Bradley Baker</a> in the 2011 series) and <b>Robear Belle</b> are the leaders of the nearby Robear Berbil village. These robot-bears are the first to befriend the ThunderCats and often supply information about local places, people and phenomena on Third Earth. Through their fields and forests of Fruit Trees, they are also able to provide the Thundereans with new foodstuffs. When they were first encountered, the ThunderCats protected the Berbil&#39;s Candy Fruit crops from the Trollogs and the Giantors.</p>
<p>It was revealed that two Ro-Bear Berbils had saved Lynx-O, Bengali, and Pumyra from the destruction of Thundera. Their ship was damaged upon evading the explosion of Thundera and landed on an island on Third Earth since it didn&#39;t have any more power to get back to the Berbil Village. The two Berbils alongside the other three ThunderCats ends up landing on an uninhabited island where they lived until they were caught by Hammerhand and his pirates. The two Berbils were later rescued by the ThunderCats and assumed to have been reunited with the other Berbils. After the Mutants and the Lunataks were removed from Third Earth, Robear Bill and Robear Belle become members of the League of Third Earth.</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, the Berbils are shown to be more bear-like and have an ability to roll up into balls. The Berbils made themselves known to the ThunderCats when they helped to repair the Thunder Tank and give them food. Panthro was against their cute appearance first until it came to repairing Ro-Bear-Bill following an attack by the Conquedor (who had been abducting Berbils and selling them as slaves). The ThunderCats managed to help the Berbils drive away the Conquedor along with his Trollog and Giantor customers. The Berbils later help in constructing Panthro&#39;s new arms and upgrading the Thunder Tank. In &#34;What Lies Above&#34; Pt. 2, Wilykit and Wilykat were able to get the Berbils to help them fight Mumm-Ra and save Avista. After Avista was safely landed, the Berbils began working to get Avista operational again.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Warrior_Maidens">Warrior Maidens</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Warrior Maidens</b> are a race of <a href="" title="Amazons">Amazon women</a> who live in the forests of what is called the Tree-Top Kingdom. They are fierce fighters and very territorial.

Often distrustful of outsiders, both become friends of the ThunderCats and by their example, the rest of their people treat them as allies. They often help the Thundereans by showing them paths around Third Earth and using special tricks (like a giant tree-top spider Bushy when it came to rescuing Tygra from Castle Plun-Darr) to aid them on their quests and missions. On one occasion, Willa is even able to use the Sword of Omens&#39; &#34;Sight Beyond Sight,&#34; which normally is possible only for Lion-O. After the Mutants and the Lunataks are removed from Third Earth, Willa and Nayda become members of the League of Third Earth.</li></ul>

However, meeting the ThunderCats, Ponzi learns his elixir has a neutralizing effect on a monster that Mumm-Ra resurrected as his vessel. He helps the Thundercats with gathering Caracara leaves to make a new batch of elixir and Lion-O with winning Pumyra&#39;s affection, though both attempts to help backfire with Ponzi&#39;s caterpillar Lucy eating all the Caracara leaves as Mumm-Ra&#39;s vessel arrives. Upon metamorphosing into her butterfly-like adult stage, Lucy uses the Caracara leaves in her body to crystallize Mumm-Ra&#39;s vessel causing Mumm-Ra to retreat.

With their home destroyed, Captain Koinelius Tunar, became fixated on getting revenge on the creature and assembled a crew of Fishmen along with a ship to hunt it down. Their journey saw them encounter the ThunderCats, under Lion-O who they captured, and initially attempted to flay as well as eat until the Ramlak attacked. Upon seeing the courage of Lion-O, Captain Tunar decided to let the ThunderCats live and asked for their help in slaying the beast. Ultimately, the Fishmen&#39;s ship was destroyed by the Ramlak and Captain Tunar was killed but Lion-O managed to slay the creature leading to all the captured water being released into the Sand Sea thus creating an oasis for the Fishmen. The Fishmen thanked Lion-O, assuring him that Tunar&#39;s death was his own doing and was beyond help, and decided to remain behind at their new home. In &#34;What Lies Above&#34; Pt. 2, Wilykit and Wilykat were able to get some of the Fishmen to help them fight Mumm-Ra and save Avista.

They force the Trollogs into hunting the Berbils&#39; Candy Fruit crops. After Lion-O had fended off the Trollogs, the Giantors had to come to the Berbil village themselves. Lion-O called for the other ThunderCats and they were able to drive away the Giantors. In the 2011 series, the Giantors still have the Trollogs work for them, but also buy some slave captured by the Conquedor.

When one of these criminals, a robotic pickpocket named Quick Pick, helps her and Lion-O against Captain Cracker, she makes him an Evil Chaser assistant. She travels on a specially equipped hoverbike called the Electro-Charger and uses a weapon called the “enzyme catalyzer” (a spray gun that uses a chemical described as &#34;a closely guarded secret, once called soap&#34;). After the Mutants and the Lunataks are removed from Third Earth, Mandora becomes a member of the League of Third-Earth.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mumm-Rana">Mumm-Rana</span></h3>
<p><b>Mumm-Rana</b> is an ancient sorceress for good and counterpart to Mumm-Ra. She lives in the White Pyramid where her powers (apparently bestowed upon her by &#34;the Ancient Spirits of Goodness&#34; whom she invokes in her very first appearance) keep her from traveling too far. She at one time battled Queen Luna (grandmother to the Lunatak Luna) to stop her rampage across Third Earth. She did so by stripping Queen Luna of her magical belt which she later lost to Luna (it was destroyed eventually). Much like Mumm-Ra, her powers limit the time she can spend outside of her pyramid home. Mumm-Rana&#39;s level of power is somewhat unclear, as she was seen to be bested in battle by Mumm-Ra in the first appearance (he used a spell to trick Mumm-Rana into thinking that the ThunderCats are evil), but she was also shown to be considerably more powerful than both Queen and Princess Luna, as she defeated both of them with relatively little effort.</p>

It is Turmagar whom often helps the ThunderCats with air support before they crafted their own air-vehicles. It is worth noting that the Tuska Warriors are among the few factions in the series to employ firearms as opposed to melee weapons and/or bows and arrows. In his self-titled episode, Turmagar comes to the ThunderCats for help against the Technopede. In &#34;Catfight,&#34; Mumm-Ra disguised himself as the Tuska in order to incite in-fighting between the original ThunderCats and the new ones.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mumm-Ra">Mumm-Ra</span></h3>
<p> 
<b>Mumm-Ra</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Earl Hammond">Earl Hammond</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Robin Atkin Downes">Robin Atkin Downes</a> in the 2011 series) - The chief villain and antagonist of the ThunderCats, the demon-priest Mumm-Ra is the self-proclaimed &#34;ever-living source of evil&#34; on Third Earth, having powers of sorcery and an apparently unlimited lifespan. He is in fact a servant to the Ancient Spirits of Evil who provide him with increased power and virtual immortality to further his pursuit of spreading their dark influence throughout Third Earth.&#60;ref name=&#34;autogenerated2&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Residing within the Black Pyramid amid the ruins of what appears to be an <a href="" title="ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptian</a> civilization, Mumm-Ra exists in a decayed, weakened <a href="" title="Mummy">mummified</a> form that must return to a stone sarcophagus to replenish his energy. He can transform himself into a far more vigorous and muscular form - Mumm-Ra, the Ever-Living - by reciting the incantation: <i>&#34;Ancient Spirits of Evil, transform this decayed form... to Mumm-Ra, the Ever-Living!&#34;</i> While in this form, Mumm-Ra possesses fortification of his mystical might — casting spells, throwing energy bolts, etc. — to battle his foes. He can also alter his physical form into a variety of alter-egos to deceive his enemies.</p>
<p>Seemingly invincible in whatever form he chooses, Mumm-Ra appears to have a singular weakness: seeing his own hideous reflection neutralizes his ability to remain outside the Black Pyramid and forces him to withdraw there in his emaciated mummy form. However, at the beginning of the second season, the Ancient Spirits of Evil revoked this shortcoming. Mumm-Ra is a master of deception, and will use whatever means necessary to fight against the forces of good. In later episodes, while endowing Mumm-Ra with his powers, the statues of the Ancient Spirits of Evil came down from their perches to extend their arms over him.</p>
<p>He uses his magic to create disguises and deceive the ThunderCats on various occasions. Among these are: Diamondfly (in the episode &#34;Queen of Eight Legs&#34;), Gregory Gregion (&#34;All That Glitters&#34;), Silky (&#34;The Garden of Delights&#34;), The Netherwitch (&#34;The Astral Prison&#34;), and Pumm-Ra (in the episode &#34;Pumm-Ra&#34;). He once took the form of <a href="" title="King Arthur">King Arthur</a> to acquire the legendary magic sword <a href="" title="Excalibur">Excalibur</a>, using it against the Sword of Omens.</p>
<p>In a few episodes, Mumm-Ra has an even more powerful form beyond &#34;Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living&#34; called &#34;Mumm-Ra the All-Powerful&#34;. In this manifestation, Mumm-Ra absorbs the entire power of the Ancient Spirits of Evil to become grander in size and strength, and the design pattern on his loin cloth changes, as does his voice. This form is only presented in the series three times. In another incarnation, invoking &#34;the Ancient Spirits of the Dream World&#34; to transform himself into &#34;Mumm-Ra the Dream Master&#34;, he is able to enter dreams to subliminally influence the ThunderCats in their sleep as a form of mind control.</p>
<p>Mumm-Ra is regarded as immortal, and when defeated, he simply returns to his sarcophagus. Mumm-Ra cannot be truly killed; even in cases where his body is destroyed, he will eventually be restored, as he often states: &#34;Wherever evil exists, Mumm-Ra lives!&#34;</p>
<p>In later episodes, when the Ancient Spirits of Evil were increasingly disappointed with Mumm-Ra&#39;s repeated failures, they demanded he destroy the ThunderCats or else he would be forcefully removed. They dimensionally banish Ma-Mutt as an example. When Mumm-Ra fails, the Ancient Spirits of Evil trap him within a planar crystal and cast him away from Third Earth. When the ThunderCats decide to colonize New Thundera to rebuild it, the Ancient Spirits of Evil free Mumm-Ra and rebuild his pyramid there. In one episode, it was said that Mumm-Ra once owned the Sphere of Seti which increased his power. When he managed to recover it after it was found by Char, he planned to use it to increase his power and free himself from servitude to Ancient Spirits of Evil. Angered at his plot as well as at his deceptive attempts to hide it, the Ancient Spirits seal off the Black Pyramid, forcing Mumm-Ra to choose between sustenance (the pyramid) or power (the sphere). Ultimately, Mumm-Ra admits that he cannot survive without the pyramid—thus he begrudgingly surrenders the sphere and once again becomes the slave of the Ancient Spirits.</p>
<p>An absolute master of magic, Mumm-Ra possesses nearly unlimited knowledge of, and experience with, numerous mystical arts from all corners of the universe. He has such mystic talents as flight by self-<a href="" title="levitation (paranormal)">levitation</a>, <a href="" title="necromancy">necromancy</a>, <a href="" title="alchemy">alchemy</a>, <a href="" title="transmogrification">transmogrification</a>, <a href="" title="time travel">temporal manipulation</a>, <a href="" title="teleportation">teleportation</a>, <a href="" title="telekinesis">psychokinesis</a>, <a href="" title="mind control">mind control</a>, <a href="" title="astral projection">astral projection</a>, <a href="" title="scrying">scrying</a>, and energy blasts. While in the form of Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living, he becomes a conduit for the Ancient Spirits of Evil; such that he can amplify his aforementioned abilities to a nearly cosmic scale, gain super-human strength, as well as retain his undead status despite the passage of time or any injuries sustained. The price of this power, however, is extremely limited stamina: once Mumm-Ra the Ever-Living has surpassed a given threshold, he must revert back to his mummified form and enter his sarcophagus to rejuvenate himself. Also, Mumm-Ra&#39;s power in his Ever-Living form is directly linked to the condition of both his sarcophagus and the Ancient Spirits&#39; four statues within his pyramid. Should any of them be harmed or destroyed, his power weakens immediately and considerably.</p>
<p>In the 2011 version, Mumm-Ra is of alien origin with changes including demon wings on his Ever-Living form, a larger body, and a weakness to intensely bright light. His ultimate goal is universal domination and enforcing his ideal order on it. Centuries prior to the new series, Mumm-Ra used advanced technology and magic at his disposal to enslave the ancestors of the ThunderCats and the Animals into serving him so he would gather the Four Powerstones from various planets to place on the Sword of Plun-Darr, a weapon forged from a star he had collapse at the cost of the entire Plun-Darr galaxy. But managing to take the Warstone (which would become the Eye of Thundera) while staging a rebellion with the Animals&#39; help, the ThunderCat Leo defeats Mumm-Ra and strips him of the other Powerstones. But when Mumm-Ra&#39;s pyramid spacecraft was pulled into Third Earth&#39;s atmosphere, Mumm-Ra entered his tomb to bide his time for everyone else to die in the resulting crash. However, the controls were smashed and Mumm-Ra was trapped within his pyramid as the stones and survivors spread across Third Earth. However, many centuries later, Mumm-Ra used Grune to release him from his prison and masterminded Thundera&#39;s downfall. With the aid of Grune and Slythe, Mumm-Ra not only plans to obtain the Eye of Thundera, but to regain the other three Powerstones in order to get to the Sword of Plundarr and the remaining stones. Mumm-Ra also resurrected Pumyra to serve him and planted her amongst the Thunderian slaves. After Grune ends up trapped in the Astral Plane, Mumm-Ra has Slithe recruit the homicidal Addicus and sociopathic Kaynar to not only restore the Lizard army morale and punish any who quit, but also increase their numbers with members of the new generals&#39; respective races. Later, through a calculated scheme involving his agent Pumyra, Mumm-Ra regains the Sword of Plun-Darr and the Tech Stone while gaining a new ally in Vultaire.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ma-Mutt">Ma-Mutt</span></h3>
<p><b>Ma-Mutt</b> is a demonic <a href="" title="bulldog">bulldog</a> that is Mumm-Ra&#39;s pet. While incapable of speech because of his canine physiology, he appears to be a <a href="" title="sapient">sapient</a> being of roughly human intelligence. He has demonstrated the ability to fly as well as to grow in size and seems to have greatly enhanced strength.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ancient_Spirits_of_Evil">Ancient Spirits of Evil</span></h3>
<p>The <b>Ancient Spirits of Evil</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Earle Hyman">Earle Hyman</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Jim Cummings">Jim Cummings</a> and <a href="" title="Kevin Michael Richardson">Kevin Michael Richardson</a> in the 2011 series) are four dark spirits summoned by Mumm-Ra, who represent the incarnation of malicious evil. They are both the source of Mumm-Ra&#39;s powers and his eternal masters. They communicate  him through the cauldron and giant anthropomorphic statues of a <a href="" title="Wild boar">Boar</a>, <a href="" title="Vulture">Vulture</a>, <a href="" title="Crocodile">Crocodile</a>, and <a href="" title="Cattle">Ox</a>. The Ancient Spirits of Evil often provide Mumm-Ra with a source of knowledge of ancient or mystical events.  They are however, incapable of interacting with the physical realm outside of the Black Pyramid; and thus must rely on Mumm-Ra (or other beings) to serve as avatars of their power, or enact their influence accordingly. In the episode Doomgaze, it is implied they are of the same race as <a href="" title="H.P. Lovecraft">H.P. Lovecraft</a>&#39;s <a href="" title="Great Old Ones">Great Old Ones</a> as Mumm-Ra invokes <a href="" title="Yog-Sottoth">Yog-Sottoth</a> and <a href="" title="Cthulhu">Cthulhu</a> to release the evil Ta-She from her time prison.</p>
<p>In the 2011 version, the statues of the Ancient Spirits of Evil that are in Mumm-Ra&#39;s chamber are made to resemble a <a href="" title="Lizard">Lizard</a>, a <a href="" title="Jackal">Jackal</a>, a <a href="" title="Monkey">Monkey</a>, and a <a href="" title="Vulture">Vulture</a>. The Ancient Spirits played a role in the creation of both the Sword of Plun-Darr, possessing a Thunderian blacksmith to forge the weapon, and the Sword of Omens, due to the blacksmith retaining the spirits&#39; knowledge to forge a weapon similar to the previous creation. In &#34;Native Son,&#34; it is revealed that the Ancient Spirits have been worshiped by the Tiger Clan after their ancestors were driven off to the mountains due to their loyalty to Mumm-Ra. When the Tiger Clan was on the verge of dying out from an epidemic, the spirits offer to cure them in return that the newborn Tygra (who would grow up to become an enemy to Mumm-Ra and themselves) be sacrificed. When Javan refused to honor his end of the pact, the Ancient Spirits bound the souls of the Tiger Clan to the living world as shape-shifting shadow monsters that obey their every command. Some years later, a fully-grown Tygra found his way back to his ancestral home and freed his kin of the curse.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Mutants">Mutants</span></h3>
<p>These creatures are the first villains seen in the series, originating from the planet Plun-Darr. They are the long-time enemies of the Thundereans. Later in the series, it is revealed that events that stemmed from their unsuccessful invasion of Thundera ultimately led to the destruction of that planet.</p>
<p>Not content to see the Thunderians lose their homeworld, the Mutants chased after the survivors, using their spaceships to devastate the Thunderean fleet and seeming to destroy the majority of the doomed planet&#39;s escaping populace. They then boarded the flagship (which carried the ThunderCat nobles, Jaga the Wise, and the young Lion-O) in attempting to capture the Eye of Thundera. They were repelled and retreated to later relocate the crashed flagship on Third Earth.</p>
<p>It was here that Mumm-Ra’s power grounded the Mutant ship, and they were forced to follow his demands once he sank their vessel beneath the desert sands. Though they exhibited an extraordinary incompetence that was characteristic of most cartoon villains, the Mutants managed to construct their own fortress, which they called Castle Plun-Darr after their homeworld, and salvage equipment from their downed spaceship to build weapons and vehicles that they could use on Third Earth (e.g., the Skycutters, the Nosediver, etc.). There was an inconsistency on how many mutants were actually on Third Earth; some episodes had a small army guarding Castle Plun-Darr, but in most episodes, only Slythe, Monkian, Jackalman, and Vultureman were seen.</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, they referred to as &#34;Animals&#34; which their surviving ancestors brought to Third Earth after aiding Lion-O&#39;s ancestor Leo in defeating Mumm-Ra. However, while four of the races obtain a stone that made them each a power, the other animals were ultimately outmatched by the Cats and pitted against each other until the Lizards managed to salvage lost technology and ransacked Thundera with help from Mumm-Ra and Grune. Besides the Lizards, the Jackals, the Monkeys, the Birds (sorted into the Bird Nation and the Avistans), and the Rats, among the animal types presented in the reboot are the Dogs, the peaceful Elephants, the Fishmen, aquatic creatures that resemble the <i><a href="" title="TigerSharks">TigerSharks</a></i>, and a character that looks like Mon*Star from <i><a href="" title="SilverHawks">SilverHawks</a></i>.</p>

Although he lacks sophistication, his intuitive cunning is considerable. Domineering and impatient, Slithe often must browbeat the other Mutants into going along with his plans. Unlike Jackalman and Monkian (whose appearances are identical to other mutants of their kind), Slithe stands out from other Reptilians because of his ears and broader build. He pilots the Nosediver. Slithe served as Rataro&#39;s cook earlier in his career, and he retains a discriminating palate.</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, through a descendant of the Lizards that were enslaved by him, Slithe serves Mumm-Ra in order for his kind to take revenge on the ThunderCats for generations of persecution. Succeeding in ransacking Thundera, Slithe pursues Lion-O&#39;s group before overseeing the search for the Book of Omens and later the War Stones. When it came to the attack on the Elephants&#39; village while Mumm-Ra was in the Astral Plane, Slithe and Grune disobey Mumm-Ra&#39;s orders and attacked the village.&#60;ref name=&#34;autogenerated2&#34;/&#62; In &#34;Legacy,&#34; it was revealed that a Lizard named <b>Rezard</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Rob Paulsen">Rob Paulsen</a>) assisted Leo and Panthera into overthrowing Mumm-Ra. In &#34;New Alliances,&#34; some of the Lizards that worked for Slithe have been deserting Mumm-Ra causing Slithe to prosecute any that he catches.

Though he is one to take any advantage presented to him, Jackalman often sides with Slythe to keep from being the scapegoat when plans fail. He also pilots a Skycutter.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; </p>
<p>In the 2011 series, though Slythe called him a &#34;Jackalman&#34;, his real name is <b>Kaynar</b>. A deranged psychopath who was about to be placed in solitary confinement within a Dog Prison, Kaynar is recruited by Slithe to be one of Mumm-Ra&#39;s new generals. Though preferring his cell, Kaynar accepts Slithe&#39;s proposal when he mentions that he can slaughter ThunderCats while allowed to &#34;say goodbye&#34; to his jailers. Prior to his debut, Kaynar&#39;s kind was seen in the episode &#34;Legacy.&#34; During that time, a Jackalman named <b>Shen</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Rob Paulsen">Rob Paulsen</a>) assisted Leo and Panthera into overthrowing Mumm-Ra.</p>

However, Addicus is rescued from the fall by Slithe and recruited to be one of Mumm-Ra&#39;s new generals. Accepting the proposal, Addicus is allowed to get his revenge on the Bird Nation as Addicus states that they &#34;owe him a last meal.&#34; </p>
<p>He was renamed <i>&#34;Mandriloc&#34;</i> in the Spanish version.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Vultureman">Vultureman</span></h4>
<p><b>Vultureman</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Earl Hammond">Earl Hammond</a> in the 1985 series, <a href="" title="Michael McKean">Michael McKean</a> in the 2011 series) is a crafty, <a href="" title="vulture">vulture</a>-like opportunist who serves as chief <a href="" title="Invention">inventor</a> and mechanical know-it-all for the Mutants. His skills with both machines and science make him frequently indispensable, but he is more often than not blamed when his devices or machines fail to live up to Slithe’s expectations (In one episode, he grew tired of this and activated a hidden self-destruct mechanism in every single machine and vehicle the Mutants used, telling them that if his work was really so bad, then &#34;See how you do without them!&#34;). As befits a scientist, Vultureman is inquisitive and open-minded, frequently leaving him odd-man-out among his more barbaric peers. Much later, he decides to work for his own gains, and he often strikes solo deals with Mumm-Ra. He pilots a vulture-styled Flying Machine, carries a crossbow-shaped weapon, and later commands weapons like the Mutank and Thundrainium Cannon. Unlike the other mutants, Vultureman was not introduced in the opening episode of the series, but a flashback reveals him working with Slithe years earlier.</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, he is renamed <b>Vultaire</b> and is a <a href="" title="prefect">prefect</a> of Avista (a floating futuristic city in the sky). Like the other birds in this series, Vultaire is shown with wings on his back (where the 80&#39;s version didn&#39;t have wings). Vultaire&#39;s ancestors were entrusted with the Tech Stone by Leo and used it to build Avista with the stone&#39;s power keeping Avista afloat. Like many of his kind, Vultaire is arrogant and sees himself above those who live on the land, especially the ThunderCats whom he considers to be manipulative <a href="" title="barbarian">barbarians</a>. When the ThunderCats arrive to Avista for the Tech Stone, Vultaire accepted Tigra&#39;s challenge for the item to obtain the two stones in his group&#39;s possession. But upon losing, Vultaire refuses to honor his end of the deal and places ThunderCats under <a href="" title="house arrest">house arrest</a>. He was momentarily held hostage by Pumrya in order to gain access to the Tech Stone. However, Vultaire purposely left the security system active as it knocked out Pumyra while having his Ravenman guards escort the ThunderCats to be thrown out of Avista with the trash before Mumm-Ra&#39;s forces make their move. Though aiding the ThunderCats in fighting off Mumm-Ra&#39;s army, Vultaire betrays his fellow Avistans and aligns himself with Mumm-Ra upon witnessing his power firsthand. Vultaire shoots down Tygra and then quotes to Addicus &#34;the enemy of my enemy is my friend.&#34; Vultaire joins Slithe, Kaynar, and Addicus into fighting Tygra, Panthro, and Cheetara prior to the latter knocking him out before Tygra can get payback for the bird&#39;s treachery. After Mumm-Ra claimed the Tech Stone, Vultaire joined Mumm-Ra&#39;s forces into retreating from Avista.</p>
<p>He was renamed <i>&#34;Buítro&#34;</i> in the Spanish version.</p>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Ratar-O">Ratar-O</span></h4>

This portly rodent is considered the most cunning and evil of all the Mutants. He comes to Third Earth at the behest of the Vultureman to aid them in defeating the ThunderCats. His flagship the Ratstar is a powerful war machine. Though it crashes, Ratar-O salvages parts to make a Mutank to continue the fight. He is strong and wields the Rat&#39;s Eye (a pair of kris-style daggers which have two mystical gems embedded in their hilts) that he can use to fire energy blasts, levitate foes and even fly through the air. Ratar-O is a descendant Ratilla the Terrible (the former holder of the Sword of Plun-Darr).</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, Ratar-O is the <a href="" title="dictator">dictator</a> of the Rats, a descendant of Ratilla who found the Sword of Plun-Darr after the Animals ended up on Third Earth. While under Mumm-Ra&#39;s services, the Rats served as janitors within the Black Pyramid before ending up scavengers on Third Earth. Though Ratilla used the item to turn his people into a power equal to the ThunderCats, the Sword of Plun-Darr corrupted his mind before Jaga is forced to kill him in order to seal the weapon away in what becomes Mount Plun-Darr. As the weapon&#39;s whereabouts are unknown to Mumm-Ra, Ratar-O buys the Thunderian survivors from the Lizards to use as slaves to mine for the Sword of Plun-Darr and obtain it for him due to the curse Jaga placed on it that kills any who attempt to retrieve it. When the ThunderCats raid Mount Plun-Darr as Tygra and Cheetara pose as slaves to get the sword, Lion-O&#39;s group are captured by Mordax and turned over to Ratar-O. But once Tygra and Cheetara found the Sword of Plun-Darr, it caused much of Mount Plun-Darr to collapse with Ratar-O&#39;s palace destroyed in the process. Following the castle collapse, Ratar-O battles Lion-O who manages to defeat Ratar-O as he retreats underground.</p>

When the ThunderCats raid Mount Plun-Darr, Pumyra is prevented from killing Mordax by Lion-O wishing to show mercy rather than force. Though Mordax takes advantage of the act of kindness by taking Lion-O, Pumyra, and Panthro prisoner and hand them over to Ratar-O. Mordax later turn against Ratar-O, refusing to kill Lion-O and by returning the Sword of Omens to him before making his escape.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/thundercats/index.html&#60;/ref&#62;" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/thundercats/index.html&#60;/ref&#62;">http://www.cartoonnetwork.com/tv_shows/thundercats/index.html&#60;/ref&#62;</a></p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="The_Lunataks">The Lunataks</span></h3>
<p>Hailing from the Moons of Plun-Darr, these vile beings were once feared criminals in ancient times. They dwell in Dark Side, a volcanic region on the far side of Fire-Rock Mountain. They were encased in molten rock by Mumm-Ra when they attempted to take control of Third Earth. Mumm-Ra later had the Mutants release them on the condition that they work for him to battle the ThunderCats. However, the Lunataks instead form their own &#39;third column&#39; based in Dark Side where they build a massive floating fortress called Sky Tomb from which they strike against all of Third Earth. Their numbers consist of:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Luna</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Lynne Lipton">Lynne Lipton</a>) — A <a href="" title="midget">midget</a> sorceress who is the leader and chief strategist of the Lunataks. Because of her small form, she is carried around and cared for by Amok, her servant. Cruel and caustic, Luna at one time recovered the magical belt once worn by her grandmother Queen Luna and used its power to grow tall and mobile again, but reverted in size when the belt was later destroyed.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Amok</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Earl Hammond">Earl Hammond</a>) — Luna’s loyal servant and bodyguard, also her chief mode of transportation. A hulking, <a href="" title="quadrupedal">quadrupedal</a> <a href="" title="bulldog">bulldog</a>/<a href="" title="demon">demon</a>-like brute with very limited capacity for vocalization, Amok is strong and fast but also displays enough cunning to exact revenge against Luna for abandoning him when she recovers Queen Luna’s magical belt. He also has an innate weakness for candies, and will abandon Luna in an instant if it means getting to eat it.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Alluro</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Doug Preis">Doug Preis</a>) — A gangrel-looking creature with a slimy and treacherous personality, Alluro is a master of <a href="" title="deception">deception</a>, <a href="" title="mind game">mind games</a>, and <a href="" title="psychological warfare">psychological warfare</a>. He is not much of a fighter, but he uses a powerful weapon called a Psyche-Club to immobilize his foes. The crystal ball launched from his club focuses his mental powers onto a foe, allowing him to manipulate their minds with illusions or to command them to do his bidding. Unlike the other Lunatak soldiers, no connection is ever made between Alluro&#39;s powers and any condition on his home-world moon that would necessitate having them.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Tug Mug</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Bob McFadden">Bob McFadden</a>) — A Lunatak from one of Plun-Darr’s moons with strong gravity, Tug Mug proves extremely powerful in the lesser gravity of Third Earth. He can use his tripod &#34;legs&#34; to leap great distances, and his strength is so impressive that he once snapped the blade of the Sword of Omens with his bare hands (it was later repaired by Ben-Gali). Combative by nature, Tug Mug can use a &#34;gravity carbine&#34; in battle, whose gravitation beams can make a living being or object light as air or as heavy as stone.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Chilla</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Gerrianne Raphael">Gerrianne Raphael</a>) — This female Lunatak from the ice moon of Plun-Darr has command over cold and heat by the power of her expelled breath, blowing to freeze the air around a target in seconds to immobilize them, or heating it through her heat beams (both optical or from her hands) to incite flames or burn them. She has little regard for life and sometimes uses her powers willfully out of spite. Her one major weakness is <a href="" title="rock salt">rock salt</a> which is known for its ability to melt ice. Out of all the Lunataks, Chilla is the most humanoid.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Red-Eye</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Earle Hyman">Earle Hyman</a>) — A Lunatak from the misty moon of Plun-Darr, this hulking brute has enhanced vision capabilities allowing him to see things in <a href="" title="infra-red">infra-red</a> and even to detect the ThunderCat Tygra when invisible. A loyal follower of Luna, Red-Eye uses a spinning discus (stored in his armored chestplate) to battle his foes. He is often the engineer and pilot of Sky Tomb.</li></ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Hammerhand_and_the_Berserkers">Hammerhand and the Berserkers</span></h3>
<p>This odd band of <a href="" title="viking">viking</a>-like <a href="" title="Piracy">pirates</a> first appeared pillaging the northern shores of the Unicorn Forest (as seen in the episode <i>The Terror of Hammerhand</i>). They have a habit of repeating certain words or phrases three times. The original Berserkers resembled vikings and were apparently all killed when their ship was sank, but Hammerhand was later mystically resurrected by Mumm-Ra who summoned up his spirit to animate a clone of Panthro which he had created. When the plan failed, Hammerhand&#39;s spirit broke Mumm-Ra&#39;s control and the clone body shifted into Hammerhand&#39;s original form before departing. When he next appeared in the Season 2 mini-series &#34;ThunderCats-Ho!&#34;, Hammerhand had reformed the Berserkers with new members endowed with cybernetic bodies and powers like his own. Mumm-Ra enlisted them into capturing Lynx-O, Bengali, Pumyra, and the two Berbils that rescued them.</p>
<p>The Berserkers are made up of:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Hammerhand</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Earl Hammond">Earl Hammond</a>) — The leader of the Berserkers who has a cybernetic arm that can punch and pound with great force. After he and his original Berserkers were killed, Hammerhand was later mystically resurrected by Mumm-Ra, who summoned up his spirit to animate a clone of Panthro which he had created. When the plan failed, Hammerhand&#39;s spirit broke Mumm-Ra&#39;s control and the clone body shifted into Hammerhand&#39;s original form before departing.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Topspinner</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Bob McFadden">Bob McFadden</a>) — A warrior who can spin at high speeds to deflect missile objects or smash opponents. His spinning can also make him dizzy.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Ram Bam</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Peter Newman (actor)">Peter Newman</a>) — Rolling by the wheel embedded in his chest, this fighter can launch himself along the ground at high speeds to smash through objects like a battering ram. He also has rollers on his feet to help him move fast.</li></ul>


<ul>
<li><b>Cruncher</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Earle Hyman">Earle Hyman</a>) — A hulking pirate whose sheer strength can crush buildings and boulders with ease.</li></ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Grune">Grune</span></h3>
<p><b>Grune the Destroyer</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Bob McFadden">Bob McFadden</a> in the original series, <a href="" title="Clancy Brown">Clancy Brown</a> in the 2011 series) is an anthropomorphized <a href="" title="Smilodon">saber-toothed tiger</a> in appearance. This former ThunderCat noble who was once a good friend to Jaga the Wise on Thundera. However, his lust for power and greed turned him renegade against his fellow ThunderCats, forcing Jaga to fight him in a titanic battle that lasted for days. Grune was defeated by Jaga, then banished and sent into exile in space. He wields a <a href="" title="mace (club)">mace</a> and possess immense super-human strength. Eventually his spacecraft landed on Third Earth and he began terrorizing its natives until, many years later, he was defeated (by unknown means) and sealed away inside a tomb (which was covered with a stone slab and a tree to prevent others from opening it). At some point, Grune lost one of his fangs. A tablet held the seal in place, until centuries later, a pair of Bolkins accidentally released his spirit. Once freed, the ghost of Grune seeks out the ThunderCats, attacking them to draw out Jaga, whose spirit ultimately defeats him using both Lion-O’s strength and the Eye of Thundera. However, Grune would return later when summoned by Mumm-Ra to stop Jaga’s spirit from obtaining the Star of Thundera (which was needed to help free three more Thundereans — Pumyra, Ben-Gali and Lynx-O — from the Mutant prisons at Fire-Rock Mountain). When the ThunderCats return to New Thundera, Grune is resurrected by Mumm-Ra. Grune initially succeeds in defeating Lion-O, breaking the Sword of Omens and chaining Lion-O and Cheetara up on the Churning Rocks. However, Snarf gathers the pieces of the sword and while attempting to take them to Ben-Gali for repair, he is captured by Char, who repairs the sword and makes it even more powerful, wanting to keep it for himself. Sensing the sword is repaired, Lion-O calls for it and uses it to free himself and Cheetara. Grune attempts to defeat Lion-O, but fails and is banished back to Third Earth when Lion-O activates the ThunderCat signal.</p>
<p>In the 2011 series, Grune is one of Claudus&#39; trusted generals who was best friends with Panthro in the past while confiding in him his desire to rise up the ranks. During one of their missions, Grune ripped his sabertooth off to save Panthro from Spidera. When Grune and Panthro sparred to prove themselves to get a promotion from Claudus, Claudus instead promoted Lynx-O as general and assigned Grune and Panthro to find the Book of Omens. Grune felt betrayed and drove himself mad with his own paranoia. Eventually, his jealousy towards the king was used by Mumm-Ra to convince Grune to become his follower and serve a key role in Thundera&#39;s downfall. However, Grune also intended to betray Mumm-Ra in the long run prior to leading the attack on the Elephants&#39; village to obtain the spirit stone there resulting with Grune getting sucked into the Astral Plane thanks to Panthro (who lost his arms in the process).</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Other_villains">Other villains</span></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Amortus</b> (voiced by <a href="" title="Peter Newman (actor)">Peter Newman</a>) - A villain who appeared in &#34;The Touch of Amortus.&#34; He was a pinkish figure who had one short arm and an <a href="" title="octopus">octopus</a> tentacle on the other side. He was a being who had been trapped by Mumm-Ra on New Thundera&#39;s location called The Land of No Return. He pleaded with Mumm-Ra to release him from his imprisonment, so Mumm-Ra tasked him with the villain of destroying the ThunderCat Lynx-O. Amortus afflicted Lynx-O with his dreaded &#39;Touch of Amortus,&#39; which caused him to suffer from [delusions of persecution] and he was alienated from the rest of his comrades. Lynx-O then flew to The Land of No Return to confront the source of the hallucinations, only to inflicted with a deadlier &#39;Touch of Amortus&#39; that turned him to stone (the same move that petrified some of his other victims). He was also revealed to have turned many Thunderians to stone during his imprisonment, and it was only with the Sword of Omens that Lion-O was able to overcome the being, curing all of his teammates and temporarily reviving the stone figures, who were able to defeat him. Amortus called for Mumm-Ra to help him when the stone figures have him overwhelmed. As punishment for his failure, Mumm-Ra permanently banished him to another location.</li></ul>

After Lion-O was effected by the waters and Jagara discovered that the water he was given from the Well of Doubt, Baron Tass attacks the ThunderCats with some stone statues.

As part of their plans, they used to leave food floating on the sands to attract the beast and incidentally captured the ThunderCats who were being led by Lion-O. Before the Fishmen could kill them, the Ramlak attacked their ship but were driven off by Lion-O and his comrades. Following Captain Tunar explaining his past, Lion-O decided to accompany him in slaying the beast. They ultimately managed to find the creature but Captain Tunar&#39;s single-minded pursuit of revenge led to the loss of the ship along with the near death of the entire crew.
