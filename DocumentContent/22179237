A busy Kermit has Scooter answer Smedley&#39;s questions. Mr. Smedley needs to know what species everybody in the theater is, but Scooter&#39;s not sure what Gonzo is. Scooter asks Gonzo what he is, but Gonzo states that he&#39;s never really thought about it before. Scooter asks around, and nobody else is sure. Eventually, Rizzo comes to the conclusion that Gonzo is a &#34;Gonzo&#34;. Scooter gives Smedley the answer, but then after realising who Gonzo is, he realizes that having Gonzo in the theater would raise the premium up to five thousand percent.  Gonzo assures a nervous Smedley that his act is risk-free, and offers to let Smedley test out his act, which would involve Smedley getting inside a cannon. A frightened Smedley then claims that there was an error and that the insurance company owes the theater thirty-two cents, and rushes off just before the big finale, which ends up sending Gonzo to the hospital. At the hospital, Scooter begs Gonzo to tell him what he is.

<li><b>Issue #4: Piggy&#39;s Story</b> - The guest star is Madame Rhonda, a psychic. She gives fortunes to various Muppets backstage. When she reads Miss Piggy&#39;s fortune, she tells her that she&#39;ll lose something valuable and green, referring to her money (as she takes the purse when Piggy isn&#39;t looking), but she thinks Madam Rhonda is talking about Kermit. Miss Piggy soon gets jealous when she sees Kermit talking to the other female Muppets. Meanwhile, Kermit, who doesn&#39;t believe in Madame Rhonda&#39;s fortune telling, eventually lets Fozzie and Gonzo talk him into getting his fortune told. Later, Kermit, Miss Piggy, and Madame Rhonda end up in jail, while a police officer explains what happened to his boss. As shown in flashback form, Miss Piggy sees Madame Rhonda reading Kermit&#39;s palm and karate chops them both. Miss Piggy then finds out that Madame Rhonda had taken her purse. Madame Rhonda admits to her psychic powers being a scam, and Kermit decides not to press charges on Miss Piggy for karate chopping him. Since the theater is only a short distance away, he decides to walk back with Miss Piggy, but then they remember that Miss Piggy is supposed to be in the closing number. They rush back to the theater just in time for Miss Piggy to sing the final line. Other sketches include &#34;An Editorial by Sam the Eagle&#34; revolving around gullibility, &#34;Veterinarian&#39;s Hospital,&#34; The Talking Houses sketch, the Muppet Labs sketch, and &#34;Pigs in Space.&#34;

<li><b>Issue #4: Be It Ever So Humble...</b> - The search for treasure starts to cause damage to the Muppet Theater. Meanwhile, The Electric Mayhem decides to drop Animal as their drummer, replacing him with M.A.M.M.A. A saddened Animal recalls that Bunsen told him that he can stop his treatment whenever he wants, and Animal gives up his pills quickly becoming his old self again. Kermit finds Rizzo and reminds him that the Muppet Theater is more than just a theater, it&#39;s Rizzo&#39;s home. Rizzo tries to tell the other rats to stop, but they won&#39;t listen.  Meanwhile, Kismet tricks Bunsen and Beaker into leaving the laboratory so that he can steal Bunsen&#39;s latest invention, x-ray glasses, and use it to find the treasure. Kismet finds that the treasure is in the basement. However, as soon as he finds the treasure, Miss Piggy shows up with a cop telling him to arrest Kismet for replacing her jewels with shabby fake replacements. Kismet tells her that the originals turned out to be fake as well, but Piggy is aware of this. She just thought hers were the best fakes money could buy. A monster named <a href="" title="Rumpelstiltskin">Rumpelstiltskin</a> is ordered by a dwarf to smash a pillar, which will destroy the whole Muppet Theater and make the treasure easy to find (not knowing that it had been found). Kermit, Fozzie, and Gonzo all tell him that if he wants to break down the theater, he&#39;d have to get through them. Rumpelstiltskin is about to do so anyway, until Miss Piggy informs everybody that the treasure&#39;s been found. As they are about to open the treasure chest, Animal crashes through the theater on a construction ball, destroying the Muppet Theater. All that&#39;s in the treasure chest are letters written by Peg-Leg Wilson and his wife which after reading the letters, makes them realize that the Muppet Theater itself was the treasure. Soon, the stamps on all the letters end up being worth exactly the same amount as the costs to repair the Muppet Theater, and Kermit decides to take The Muppet Show on the road, but can only afford to travel to four towns. Other sketches include include &#34;A Young Frog&#39;s Guide to Stamp Collecting&#34;, &#34;Muppet Labs&#34;, &#34;Veterinarian&#39;s Hospital&#34;, and an act from Gonzo.

<li><b>Issue #1: Watch That Tiger</b> - With the Muppet Theater in disarray after the events of &#34;The Treasure of Peg-Leg Wilson&#34;, the Muppet gang decides to take their show on the road while the Muppet Theater is being rebuilt. Is the world ready for traveling Muppet <a href="" title="minstrel">minstrels</a>? &#34;The Muppet Roadshow&#34; makes its first stop in Little Gideon, Ohio. Miss Piggy is afraid that the show won&#39;t work without a theater, and Kermit the Frog is worried that he won&#39;t make enough money to pay Mister Weazell (who owns the land they&#39;re performing on). To make matters worse, Fozzie decides to take his act solo and a <a href="" title="tiger">tiger</a> has escaped. Can the Muppet Roadshow gain an audience...and more importantly, a profit? Other sketches include a patent-medicine style version of &#34;Veterinarian&#39;s Hospital,&#34; &#34;Country Cooking with The Swedish Chef&#34;, a performance of &#34;Whispering&#34; by Sweetums and Robin the Frog backed by The Acoustic Mayhem, a &#34;Muppet News Flash, a rendition of &#34;The Muppet Show Theme,&#34; and a brief backup called &#34;Alphabear&#34; featuring Fozzie&#39;s solo act.

<li><b>Issue #2: His Wackiness, Clint Wacky!</b> - The Muppets hire Clint Wacky as a temporary replacement for Fozzie, and the Muppets also pick up Clint Wacky&#39;s writers Mr. Stadler and Mr. Waltorf. They perform at Little Statwald, home to only two families (Statler and Waldorf&#39;s families). Clint Wacky tells insulting jokes which the audience likes, but Kermit and Scooter decide they don&#39;t want the show to be known for insulting the audience. Scooter offers to write new material for Mr. Wacky, but Clint turns it down stating that he gets compensation if his material gets rewritten or if he gets fired, but since it&#39;s okay for Clint Wacky to quit at any time, the Muppets try to find a way to get him to leave. Eventually, Rizzo the Rat tricks Clint into thinking that Hollywood finally wants him, and Clint rushes away. However, this means that the show is without a closing comedian. Since Scooter had written plenty of comedy material, he goes on-stage. At first he has no luck, but then Dr. Teeth tells him to lose the script and improvise, and Scooter ends up succeeding with the audience. Other sketches include &#34;The Woodland Gerbils&#34;, &#34;Pigs in Space&#34;, &#34;The Talking Caravans&#34;, and Fozzie Bear in &#34;Garbage&#34;. </li></ul>

<li><b>Issue #3: Box Clever</b> - The Muppets finally return to the Muppet Theater and put on their first show at the newly-rebuilt Muppet Theater. A package addressed to Fozzie (who hasn&#39;t gotten back yet) arrives as well. The various Muppets want to know what&#39;s in the package, but Kermit suggests they wait until Fozzie comes back. Eventually, it&#39;s decided to put the package in the basement, but everybody (including Kermit) sneaks down to try to open it. Eventually, they decide to open the package. It turns out that Fozzie was in the package (he had enough money to mail himself, but mistakenly addressed it to himself) and Fozzie joins the Muppets for the closing number. Statler and Waldorf are excited about Fozzie&#39;s return so they can throw stuff at him. Meanwhile, Gonzo decides to raise money for charity by traveling in a number of ways (covered by Louis Kazagger) including running, moving bathtub, and cannon. He makes it back to the Muppet Theater during the closing number. Gonzo had planned on giving the money to the &#34;Chessington Wasp Society.&#34; But due to a scandal, Gonzo changes his mind. Fozzie suggests giving the money to a charity for retired gentlemen theater patrons. Other sketches include &#34;Muppet Labs,&#34; &#34;Veterinarian&#39;s Hospital,&#34; &#34;Pigs in Space,&#34; and &#34;At the Dance.&#34;
