<h1>Hunting Dog (Felids)</h1>

<p><b>Hunting Dogs (Felids)</b> refers to those few <a href="" title="Hunting">Hunting</a> <a href="" title="Dog">Dogs</a> which are used primarily on large <a href="" title="felid">felids</a> (members of the Cat Family), typically <a href="" title="lion">lions</a> in the <a href="" title="Old World">Old World</a> and <a href="" title="cougar">cougars</a> in the <a href="" title="New World">New World</a>. A pack may be used to track the animal and keep it at <a href="" title="Bay dog">bay</a>, which combines giving voice to the sound known as ‘’baying’’ and surrounding and confining the animal or they may be expected to engage the animal in combat and seize it, in the manner of the <a href="" title="catch dog">catch dogs</a> used in <a href="" title="Boar hunting">Boar hunting</a>, until the huntsmen have an opportunity to dispatch it. Because of this dual function, such dogs are often among the largest of all <a href="" title="Hunting Dog">Hunting Dogs</a>, and typically are of essentially <a href="" title="Molosser">Molosser</a> <a href="" title="Dog type">type</a>.</p>

Though the resulting dogs were undoubtably used to bay lions,  the 2008 Rhodesian Ridgeback World Congress took the view that in its early use, the Ridgeback was more a &#34;Hunter&#39;s/Farmer&#39;s Ox-Wagon Dog&#34; than a &#34;Lion Dog”, and had a general guarding and hunting role, including the hunting of birds. They have also been used to hunt other felids such as <a href="" title="cheetah">cheetahs</a> and <a href="" title="leopard">leopards</a>&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.showdogs.co.za/features/southafrican/features_national_south_african.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.showdogs.co.za/features/southafrican/features_national_south_african.html">National breed—South African dog</a>, <i>Showdogs</i>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>Another breed based, like the panther dog, on the <a href="" title="Bulldog">Bulldog</a> - Mastiff cross is the <a href="" title="Bullmastiff">Bullmastiff</a>, which was used against <a href="" title="poaching">poachers</a> (as it was deemed quicker than the Mastiff), as was the <a href="" title="Boerboel">Boerboel</a> of <a href="" title="South Africa">South Africa</a> (known to contain Rhodesian Ridgeback and Bullmastiff).</p>

The dogs used in <a href="" title="Australia">Australian</a> wild boar hunting (called pigging) are compounded of some of these breeds plus others, but have no uniform formula for breeding.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.boardogs.com/Boardogs_F1_crosses.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.boardogs.com/Boardogs_F1_crosses.htm">Boardogs: F1 crosses</a>, <i>Boardogs</i>&#60;/ref&#62; Dog breeds used specifically against the <a href="" title="wolf">wolf</a> are large <a href="" title="sighthound">sighthounds</a> (<a href="" title="Irish Wolfhound">Irish Wolfhound</a>, <a href="" title="Borzoi">Borzoi</a>), rather than <a href="" title="molosser">molosser</a> mixes such as the panther dog. (See <a href="" title="Wolf hunting with dogs">Wolf hunting with dogs</a>.) It can only be a matter of speculation as to why the <a href="" title="Newfoundland (dog)">Newfoundland</a>, a breed associated with aquatic rescue, should have been included in the panther dog development, except for the addition of size, as its long coat might be a detriment to movement in heavy cover, as was the case in heavy snow, when that breed was bred into the <a href="" title="St. Bernard (dog)">St. Bernard</a>.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/stbernard.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.canadasguidetodogs.com/stbernard.htm">St Bernard</a>, <i>Canada&#39;s Guide to Dogs</i>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>The hunting of cougars is still permitted in some American states, but the dogs are utilized to track the cat, tree it and bay to alert the hunter, rather than to engage the cougar in combat as the panther dog did.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://wdfw.wa.gov/wlm/game/hunter/cougar/index.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://wdfw.wa.gov/wlm/game/hunter/cougar/index.htm">Cougar Hunting Seasons and Regulations</a>, Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
