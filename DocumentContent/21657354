<p>Green Balloon Club is a wildlife club on CBeebies, both on screen and online.  
It is hosted by 4 children: Lily-Rose who loves flowers and plants, Ant whose specialty is minibeasts, Cat who is the animals expert and Jay whose interest is in birds.  Together with Skipper the dog and their balloonist, Sky, the children fly around the UK looking out for other Green Balloon Club Members and having a look at what wildlife they have in their patch.  Special reporters for the programme are Jelly ( <a href="" title="The Story Makers">The Story Makers</a>, <a href="" title="CBeebies">CBeebies</a> <a href="" title="Springwatch">Springwatch</a>), Nature Chris and <a href="" title="Bill Oddie">Bill Oddie</a>.  The programme was conceived and made by Clare Bradley, Lotte Elwell and the <a href="" title="CBeebies">CBeebies</a> Production team, and grew out of their previous award-winning work on CBeebies <a href="" title="Springwatch">Springwatch</a> and <a href="" title="Autumnwatch">Autumnwatch</a>.</p>
<p>The show was originally part of the &#34;EcoBeebies&#34; brand. It started with a launch show named <i>Easy Peasy Eco Beebies</i> on 13 June 2008, and this was followed by 48 episodes, one every week from June 20, 2008 to May 29, 2009.</p>
<p>Each episode starts with the children doing the register, then joining in with the &#34;Green Balloon Club&#34; chant. At the end of the show, the balloon &#34;lands&#34; and everybody sings a song. The programme is particularly noted for its ham-fisted use of autotuning on the voices, and is often used as an example of &#34;how not to do it&#34; in sound engineer training.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Series_2:_Green_Balloon_Scrapbook_.282010.29">Series 2: <i>Green Balloon Scrapbook</i> (2010)</span></h3>
<p>In 2010, a new series of 15 episodes entitled &#34;Green Balloon Scrapbook&#34; was produced which showed &#34;what the Green Team get up to when they&#39;re not in the Green Balloon. Different members of the team check the laptop to find out what the other members of the Green Balloon Club are getting up to&#34;. These programmes included 2 song specials.  Additionally 5 holiday specials were produced in 2009 (broadcast 2010), with the team visiting the Isle of Arran and a further 5 holiday programmes from Belfast when the team became zookeepers in Belfast zoo for a week.  Lastly, the Winter Special, a winter camping adventure which was the final programme, recorded in November 2009.
