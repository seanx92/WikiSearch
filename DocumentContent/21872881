<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Characters">Characters</span></h2>

<p><b>Sophie</b> 
Sophie is the main character in the series; her birthday is on Christmas Day, and in the first book she is four years old. She is often described as wearing a faded blue jumper with her name written on it, jeans and red <a href="" title="Wellington boot">wellies</a>, and her hair is often quoted as looking <i>like she&#39;s come through a hedge backwards</i>. Her one and only ambition in life is to become a Lady Farmer, and to this end she has an ever increasing collection of pets, many of which are the focus of individual books (such as in &#39;Sophie&#39;s Tom&#39; and &#39;Sophie&#39;s Lucky&#39;). She is a determined young lady who can often come across as stubborn, but is portrayed as loveable nonetheless. She has a collection of phrases that reappear throughout the books, such as &#39;yikes&#39; &#39;you&#39;re mowldy, stupid and assive&#39; which is hissed when she is angry. The series follows Sophie as she grows up, her collection of pets growing year by year and her dream of becoming a lady farmer growing ever closer.</p>
<p><b>Matthew and Mark</b>
Mathew and Mark are Sophie&#39;s twin brothers who are two years older that Sophie herself. In the stories they speak and act very alike, and can be quite disparaging of Sophie, often repeating &#34;I know&#34; or &#34;I know what you&#39;re going to say&#34; in an attempt to wind her up. They are very sporty and are often described playing football. </p>
<p><b>Mother and Father</b> 
Sophie&#39;s mother and father are shown as very supportive in Sophie&#39;s dream of becoming a lady farmer. In the earlier books it appears that they are indulging her somewhat (what four-year-old really knows what they want to be when they grow up?) but they come to realise that she is serious in her ambitions, and do whatever they can to help. Sophie&#39;s mother drew out five different farm animals on Sophie&#39;s bedroom wall and is commented in the series &#39;to be good at that sort of thing&#39;. Sophie&#39;s father is said to like all animals except cats, but with constant harassment from his determined daughter he soon allows Sophie to adopt a stray cat(Tomboy).</p>
<p><b>Aunt Alice</b>
Aunt Alice or &#39;Aunt Al&#39; as the children call her is the Great Aunt of Sophie&#39;s father, and so Great Great Aunt to the children themselves. Sophie is especially fond of Aunt Al, who lives up in the Scottish Highlands and shares Sophie&#39;s love of animals. She is described in the books as being quite &#39;bird like&#39; and is very encouraging of Sophie&#39;s wish to become a Lady Farmer.</p>
<p><b>Dawn</b> 
Dawn is described as a pretty little girl the same age as Sophie who wears frocks and always has her golden hair tied in bunches and is seen carrying bright plastic toy ponies. Sophie and Dawn first meet when Sophie&#39;s mother invites her round to play, but when Dawn stamps on one of Sophie&#39;s woodlice Sophie retaliates by destroys her toy pony and they become enemies from there on after.</p>
<p><b>Duncan</b>
Duncan is a short tubby little boy who is a playmate of Sophie&#39;s. She takes advantage of the fact that he initially wants to work on her farm when she is older, and often gets him to pretend to be a horse or other farm animal when they are playing. Duncan is on the promise he will be paid in eggs, milk and cornflakes when Sophie eventually owns her farm, but when she falls ill with chickenpox Dawn moves in and bribes him with sweets and he then becomes Sophie&#39;s second enemy.</p>
<p><b>Andrew</b> 
Andrew is a farmers son and when Sophie discovers this she sets out to make friends with him, in declaration that if she can&#39;t have a farm of her own she will marry Andrew and they will have his father&#39;s farm when he retires.</p>
<p><b>Tomboy</b>
Tomboy was Sophie&#39;s first pet, and appears in the book &#39;Sophie&#39;s Tom&#39;. She is a coal black cat and arrives on Sophie&#39;s fifth birthday (Christmas Day). She was originally named Tom as Sophie thought she was a boy, but when she gives birth to four <a href="" title="kittens">kittens</a> Aunt Al comes up with the new name Tomboy.</p>
<p><b>Beano</b>
Beano is Sophie&#39;s second pet; a large <a href="" title="Albinism">albino</a> rabbit which is a present from Aunt Al. Sophie wonders what to call her new pet and asks &#34;why has he got pink eyes?&#34; to which Aunt Al replies &#34;because he&#39;s Albino&#34;. Sophie thinks &#34;if I take off the Al (after all we&#39;ve already got one of those) that just leaves Beano.&#34;</p>
<p><b>Puddle</b>
Puddle is Sophie&#39;s third pet; a white <a href="" title="terrier">terrier</a> puppy with a black patch over his eye, who appears in &#39;Sophie Hits Six&#39;. In this book, Sophie asks for a dog but is told by her parents she is too young. At Andrew&#39;s farm she discovers that his dog Lucy (a terrier) has given birth to a litter of puppies which Sophie falls in love with. Both parents discuss how when they were younger they wanted a dog but weren&#39;t allowed one, and laugh that they are definitely old enough now. On Christmas Day, Sophie&#39;s sixth birthday they buy her a puppy. When choosing a name the family suggest Patch or Pirate but Sophie doesn&#39;t like these, and when the puppy wees in a corner Sophie has the idea to call him puddle.</p>
<p><b>Lucky</b>
Lucky is the pet pony who appears in the final book &#39;Sophie&#39;s Lucky&#39;. After the sad death of Aunt Al, her house in Scotland is left to the family in her will, along with money for Matthew and Mark, and an actual farm for Sophie. Sophie is as yet unaware of this as it won&#39;t be given to her until she turns 18, but on <a href="" title="Boxing Day">Boxing Day</a> morning after the family have moved into Aunt Al&#39;s property, the twins get two brand new mountain bikes and Sophie is given a pony. She says &#34;this is the happiest I have ever been in all of my life&#34;. </p>
<p><b>Dolly</b>
Dolly is Tomboy&#39;s only daughter; a tortoiseshell cat. When Tomboy has her four kittens Sophie hopes they are all girls and calls them Molly, Polly, Dolly and Holly in the hope that they  themselves will grow up and have more kittens. However, when Meg Morris the owner of the local riding <a href="" title="stables">stables</a> comes round she informs Sophie that all the kittens are boys, except for Dolly who she buys. Later on in the story when Sophie and her mother at the Stables asking about riding lessons Dolly remembers Sophie.  </p>
<p><b>Ollie</b> 
Ollie is Tomboy&#39;s son; just like his mother he is coal black. Aunt Al rings up to ask if all the kittens have gone and Sophie explains that only one is left. Aunt Al asks if she may have him and changes his name from Holly to Ollie, short for Oliver.</p>
