They have a dense inner coat that provides them with adequate warmth, and a water repellent outer coat that lies flat against their bodies.

The Golden Retriever has its roots in Scotland. In the mid-18th century, wildfowl hunting was very popular among the wealthy. In Scotland, a dog was needed that could retrieve from water and land because the land was covered in ponds and rivers. Early retrievers were crossed with the best of water spaniels, giving rise to the dog known as the Golden Retriever.&#60;ref&#62;A Spot-it Guide to Dogs/by Mary Ross&#60;/ref&#62; The Golden Retriever was first developed in Scotland at &#34;Guisachan&#34; near <a href="" title="Glen Affric">Glen Affric</a>, the highland estate of <a href="" title="Dudley Marjoribanks, 1st Baron Tweedmouth">Sir Dudley Marjoribanks</a> later <a href="" title="Baron Tweedmouth">Baron Tweedmouth</a>. For many years, there was controversy over which breeds were originally crossed. In 1952, the publication of Marjoribanks&#39; breeding records from 1835 to 1890 dispelled the myth concerning the purchase of a whole troupe of Russian <a href="" title="Herding dog">sheepdogs</a> from a visiting <a href="" title="circus">circus</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;Golden Retrievers: History&#34;&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.k9web.com/dog-faqs/breeds/goldens.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.k9web.com/dog-faqs/breeds/goldens.html">Golden Retrievers: History.</a> K9web.com.

<p>Improvements in guns during the 1800s resulted in more <a href="" title="fowl">fowl</a> being downed during hunts at greater distances and over increasingly difficult terrain. This led to more birds being lost in the field. Because of this improvement in <a href="" title="firearm">firearms</a>, a need for a specialist retriever arose, as training setter and pointer breeds in retrievals were found to be ineffective. Thus, work began on the breeding of the dog to fill this much-needed role.&#60;ref name=&#34;Golden Retriever Extended Breed Standard: Origin of The Golden Retriever&#34; /&#62;</p>
<p>The original cross was of a yellow-coloured Retriever, &#39;Nous&#39;, with a <a href="" title="Tweed Water Spaniel">Tweed Water Spaniel</a> female dog, &#39;Belle&#39;.&#60;ref name=&#34;Golden Retrievers: Everything You Need To know&#34;&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.goldenretriever-dog.com/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.goldenretriever-dog.com/">Golden Retrievers: Everything You Need To know.</a> goldenretriever-dog.com&#60;/ref&#62; The Tweed Water Spaniel is now extinct, but was then common in the border country. Marjoribanks had purchased Nous in 1865 from an unregistered litter of otherwise black wavy-coated <a href="" title="retriever">retriever</a> pups. In 1868, this cross produced a litter that included four pups; these four became the basis of a breeding program which included the <a href="" title="Irish Setter">Irish Setter</a>, the sandy-coloured <a href="" title="Bloodhound">Bloodhound</a>, the <a href="" title="St. John&#39;s Water Dog">St. John&#39;s Water Dog</a> of Newfoundland, and two more wavy-coated black Retrievers. The bloodline was also inbred and selected for trueness to Marjoribanks&#39; idea of the ultimate <a href="" title="hunting dog">hunting dog</a>. His vision included a more vigorous and powerful dog than previous retrievers, one that would still be gentle and trainable.

The ancestry of the Golden Retriever is all <a href="" title="sporting dog">sporting dogs</a>, in line with Marjoribanks&#39; goals.

<p>Golden Retrievers were first accepted for registration by <a href="" title="The Kennel Club">The Kennel Club</a> of England in 1903, as <b>Flat Coats – Golden</b>. They were first exhibited in 1908, and in 1911 were recognized as a breed described as <b>Retriever (Golden and Yellow)</b>. It would take another 14 years for the breed to be recognized in America, and in 1925, the <a href="" title="American Kennel Club">American Kennel Club</a> (AKC) did so. In 1938, the Golden Retriever Club of America was founded.</p>
<p>The Honourable Archie Marjoribanks took a Golden Retriever to Canada in 1881, and registered &#39;Lady&#39; with the AKC in 1894. These are the first records of the breed in these two countries. The breed was first registered in Canada in 1927, and the Golden Retriever Club of <a href="" title="Ontario">Ontario</a>, now the Golden Retriever Club of Canada (GRCC), was formed in 1958. The cofounders of the GRCC were Cliff Drysdale, an Englishman who had brought over an English Golden, and Jutta Baker, daughter-in-law of Louis Baker, who owned Northland Kennels.&#60;ref&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://www.grca.org/history/default.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.grca.org/history/default.htm">History.</a> Golden Retriever Club of America.

<p>Also,organizations other than clubs are dedicated to Golden Retrievers, such as breed-specific adoption sites.</p>
<p>In July 2006, the Golden Retriever Club of Scotland organized a gathering of Golden Retriever enthusiasts at the ancestral home of Guisachan House. A photograph was taken by photographer Lynn Kipps to commemorate the occasion. It captures 188 Golden Retrievers, so holds the record for most Golden Retrievers captured in one image. </p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Grooming">Grooming</span></h3>
<p>Golden Retrievers require regular grooming and an occasional bath.&#60;ref&#62;Dogs In Canada Magazine (2010 issue)&#60;/ref&#62; They should be groomed at least once a week, and every day during heavy shedding. They should be bathed every two months. Their coats shed somewhat during the year, but are known to shed profusely twice a year. They also need to have their ears cleaned regularly, or ear infections might occur. While shedding is unavoidable, frequent grooming (daily to weekly) lessens the amount of hair shed by the animal. Severe shedding resulting in bald patches can be indicative of stress or sickness in a Golden Retriever.</p>
