The <a href="" title="manga">manga</a> and <a href="" title="anime">anime</a> series <i><a href="" title="Black Butler">Black Butler</a></i> features an extensive cast of characters created by <a href="" title="Yana Toboso">Yana Toboso</a>. The series takes place in England during the reign of <a href="" title="Victorian era">Queen Victoria</a>. It follows Sebastian Michaelis, a demonic butler obliged to serve twelve-year-old Earl Ciel Phantomhive due to a contract he made with Ciel binding Sebastian to the child&#39;s will. Although Sebastian is able to carry out his tasks with ease and perfection, his co-workers, Bardroy, Finnian, and Mey-Rin, are not as competent, resulting in Sebastian having to complete their tasks as well. Sebastian also assists Ciel in solving the problems plaguing England.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Sebastian_Michaelis">Sebastian Michaelis</span></h3>
<p>  is the butler of the Phantomhive household and acts as Ciel&#39;s bodyguard. Sebastian often describes himself through his catchphrases  . The phrase plays on the word   and the phrase  . It can also translate to &#34;I am a demon and a butler&#34;. In Funimation&#39;s English translation, this phrase becomes &#34;I am a devilishly talented butler&#34; or &#34;I am simply one hell of a butler&#34; which is, obviously, another play on his demonic origins. </p>
<p>Being a butler is a job he is completely devoted to. He follows Ciel&#39;s orders faithfully, however, he does not seem to be overly concerned about Ciel&#39;s well-being most of the time, as he insults and irritates Ciel to see his reaction, subliminally. However, occasionally he does appear to care about Ciel at times, such as in the Noah&#39;s Arc Circus arc where he was worried when Ciel had an <a href="" title="asthma attack">asthma attack</a>, and again later on when Ciel had a <a href="" title="panic attack">panic attack</a>. Sebastian is also shown to be obsessed with cats, kittens, wild catlike beasts, and so on. Comically, the only times he does not follow Ciel&#39;s orders are when he sees a cat, too preoccupied with it to pay any attention to anything else. He has an extreme aversion to dogs, and it was much to his dismay when Pluto the hell hound came to stay at the manor.</p>
<p>He is highly skilled at practically everything, and handles every task, no matter how impossible it is, as well as any problem that arises from the errors of the other staff with ease, stating it is only natural the butler of the Phantomhive household is capable of such. This is due to the fact he is a demon who is bound by a <a href="" title="Faustian bargain">Faustian</a> contract to abide by Ciel&#39;s will. A sign matching the one marking Ciel&#39;s right eye can be found on Sebastian&#39;s left hand. The mark of the contract has been said to allow Sebastian to find Ciel. The name Sebastian is, in fact, a temporary name given to him by Ciel and was previously held by Ciel&#39;s dog. In the anime adaption, Sebastian&#39;s demonic form is associated with a <a href="" title="crow">crow</a> or a raven. Sebastian&#39;s true demonic form has not been fully revealed in the manga or the anime.  .&#60;ref name=&#34;amazonCD&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;Character&#38;Cast&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;amazonCD2&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;EngCastBlog&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; </p>
<p>In the second TV series, Sebastian resurrects Ciel with his Family Ring (which was somehow located in a &#34;New Moon Drop&#34; tea box under Alois Trancy&#39;s manor). He comes into Trancy&#39;s manor in the disguise of a wanderer needing to shelter himself from a storm, however he criticizes Claude Faustus&#39;s abilities as a butler saying he does not seem to take his responsibilities seriously when he sees a drop of sauce on the side of his dinner plate. This alerts Claude that he is Sebastian as he attacks him later on when he gets the &#34;New Moon Drop&#34; tea box from Alois. In the battle, the large traveler&#39;s trunk he is carrying opens, revealing Ciel&#39;s lifeless body. When Alois gets excited, seemingly recognizing Ciel, and wants to touch him, Sebastian says that he cannot allow such a low person as Alois and his copy-cat butler Claude to catch them. Sebastian resurrects Ciel and follows his orders obediently as before, however, he does not mention the Trancy incident or tell Ciel anything that has happened (it seems Ciel has forgotten a lot of things that had transpired in the first TV series). The air around the relationship between Ciel, Sebastian, Alois, and Claude is an enigma that seems to be one of the pinnacles of the second series.</p>
<p>It is later revealed that when Sebastian had wanted to consume Ciel&#39;s soul, Claude came (in the form of a spider) and stole Ciel&#39;s soul prior to having Sebastian consume him - thus voiding their contract. Sebastian becomes helpless when Ciel, using his contract&#39;s seal, tells him to disappear from his sight as he now recognizes Claude as his only butler and that Sebastian was responsible for the deaths of his parents and the burning of the Phantomhive Mansion.</p>
<p>Sebastian complies only to go away to a distance and mutters that though he was late in preparing dinner, it will be served - implying that he will defeat his enemies. His form becomes glowering black and eyes glow red, for there are no longer any &#39;contractual handcuffs&#39; to obey and claims that he will, &#34;Clean up every last spider.&#34;</p>
<p>He later defeats Claude, Hannah and Alois and then obtains Ciel. But due to Alois&#39;s wish which for neither demon to be able to obtain Ciel&#39;s soul, Hannah in her last moment lets Sebastian know that Ciel is no longer human but a demon. As per his contract, on never actually having devoured Ciel&#39;s soul, he was ordered to be Ciel&#39;s butler for eternity. In the manga however, Sebastian is the only demon to exist in the storyline; Ciel Phantomhive is still a human as well, as the manga is ongoing.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Ciel_Phantomhive">Ciel Phantomhive</span></h3>
<p><a href="" title="Earl">Earl</a>   born on December 14, 1875 is the business-savvy, egotistical 12-year-old (13-year-old as of chapter 14) and the head of the English Phantomhive noble family after the deaths of his parents, Lord Vincent Phantomhive and Lady Rachel Phantomhive. He runs the Funtom Company, which manufactures toys and sweets, with the later addition of a food branch after winning a <a href="" title="Royal Warrant">Royal Warrant</a>. His right eye, which is usually covered with a black eye patch, bears a <a href="" title="pentacle">pentacle</a>, the sign of the <a href="" title="Faustian">Faustian</a> contract he made with the demon Sebastian. Sebastian says that the mark on Ciel is proof of their contract. He also says that demons mark their prey so that they can locate them.</p>
<p>After his parents&#39; deaths and prior to meeting Sebastian, he was a slave and a sacrifice in a cult ritual. During one particular instance where Ciel was being tortured, his hatred for his torturers summoned Sebastian. He then commanded the demon to kill all the people in the room. During his time as a slave, a mark was burned into his back. He does not want anyone to see this mark and appears to not enjoy physical contact, though he tolerates Sebastian and does not complain when the demon picks him up or holds him. </p>
<p>He is usually portrayed as emotionless, un-childlike, though he occasionally expresses concern for the well-being of the few close to him; Sebastian is not one of those people. He sometimes portrays himself as a happy person, but soon returns to his true self. He is close with his cousin and <a href="" title="fiancée">fiancée</a> Elizabeth, seeing her as an important girl he needs to protect. Although he gets easily annoyed by her, he cares deeply for her and doesn&#39;t like seeing her sad or hurt. It becomes more apparent that Ciel loves Elizabeth, shown when he got jealous when she danced with Alois, he risks his life to protect her, and acknowledges her as his future wife. Before the loss of his parents, Ciel seemed to be a happy, childlike boy. Ciel is proficient with the use of guns, keeping a number of concealed guns nearby in order to protect himself. He has asthma, which was inherited from his mother. </p>
<p>At the end of the anime adaptation, with his revenge completed, Ciel&#39;s soul is supposedly devoured by Sebastian. Ciel insists that Sebastian make the process as painful as possible so as to &#34;carve the pain of his life into his soul&#34;.  &#60;ref name=&#34;amazonCD&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;Character&#38;Cast&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;amazonCD2&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;EngCastBlog&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>In the second TV series, Ciel is resurrected by the end of the first episode by Sebastian using his family ring (which somehow was concealed in a &#34;New Moon Drop&#34; tea box in Alois Trancy&#39;s manor). In a later episode, it was shown that Claude, Alois Trancy&#39;s butler, had stolen Ciel&#39;s soul. Ciel&#39;s resurrection is enigmatic - though he remembers Elizabeth and a few other people like Tanaka, Finnian, Mey-Rin, Baldroy, and the Undertaker - he does not seem to remember other people or certain instances. This is highlighted in the third episode when Grell makes an appearance, and Ciel asks Sebastian who Grell is. Ciel also orders Sebastian to make sure his aunt does not know about his mission, unaware that she is dead (Sebastian does not tell him this). However, when he sees Grell&#39;s overcoat a vague image of Madame Red comes into his mind, although he dismisses it quickly. It seems the events that transpired in the first season have been forgotten by him. Also, for some unknown reason, in the first episode, Alois Trancy recognizes him when he sees his lifeless body in Sebastian&#39;s suitcase and wants to capture him and Sebastian. By the end of the third episode, Ciel becomes aware of the noble house of Trancy, though it seems that Sebastian has not informed him of the events in the first episode. In episode 10, however, Ciel recovers his memories of the first season and orders Sebastian to remain his butler until he could eat his soul. This does not come about as part of the Contract that Alois Trancy strikes with Hannah Annafellows means that Ciel Phantomhive soul is made unattainable to Sebastian Michaelis due to the fact that Ciel has been transformed into a demon.</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Phantomhive_household">Phantomhive household</span></h3>
<p>The Phantomhive Estate belongs to the English noble family Phantomhive and is located outside the city of London. The Phantomhive family is a secret executive agency controlled directly by the Queen and is often referred to as the &#34;Evil Noblemen&#34; and the &#34;Queen&#39;s Watchdogs&#34;. They are tasked with eliminating anything that worries the Queen by any means necessary. They are able to control and manage the underworld of the United Kingdom to avoid any information of its existence from reaching the general public. The current head of the family is Ciel Phantomhive, son of Earl Vincent and Lady Rachel Phantomhive who were murdered and their original estate burned (the manor in which Ciel currently resides with his servants is an exact replica of the original manor). In addition to the services they provide for the Queen, the Phantomhive family runs a toy and confectionery company called Funtom Company. </p>
<p>The estate currently has five servants, but their positions as servants are a front for their real jobs of protecting the Phantomhive Estate as well as protecting Ciel, to whom they are deeply devoted. Bardroy serves as the household cook. Finnian is the gardener and Mey-Rin is the maid.  The three were personally chosen and trained by Sebastian for their duties. Tanaka has served under Earl Vincent and Lady Rachel as their butler, but has not been seen doing any work during his service under Ciel, in which his job is the house steward. Sebastian Michaelis, a demon, acts as the butler after Tanaka. Lady Rachel and Earl Phantomhive each have one sister; both married and became a part of other noble families before the start of the series. Madame Red, born as Angelina Durless, married into the Barnett family. She commits the murders investigated in the Jack the Ripper case and is killed by her accomplice after her exposure. Marchioness Frances married Marquis Middleford (Midford), and their daughter, Elizabeth, is engaged to Ciel. </p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Bardroy</b> </dt></dl>
<p> , usually referred to as Bard or Baldo, is the household cook of American descent. He rarely produces anything edible as he uses weaponry such as flamethrowers to cook, believing that cooking is an art requiring explosions. Sebastian believes anything he creates is made up of charcoal and <a href="" title="carcinogens">carcinogens</a>. Bardroy pursues cooking to learn how to slow down, as he states cooking takes patience to master. He used to be an English soldier whose entire platoon was wiped out, leaving him as the only survivor. While terrible at cooking, he is shown to be capable of taking advantage of his surroundings, such as using fine flour to create an explosion. At the conclusion of the first season of the anime, it was unknown whether he survived, although it was noted he was breathing before he collapsed. In the second season, he is revealed to have survived. Like Finnian and Mey-Rin, he provides much of the comic relief.  &#60;ref name=&#34;amazonCD&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;Character&#38;Cast&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;EngCastBlog&#34;/&#62;</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Finnian</b> </dt></dl>
<p> , often called Finny, is a gardener. However, it seems every time he tends to the garden, it is destroyed through an accident caused by his clumsiness. He is portrayed as an innocent, Shota-like character who loves his work, but is dubbed an idiot by Sebastian. Finnian displays feats of superhuman strength, such as dragging and throwing Pluto around, which he tries to suppress for fear of hurting others and risk of sabotaging his work. The sequence, S-012, is tattooed on the <a href="" title="nape">nape</a> of his neck and is usually covered by his straw hat. He works as a gardener to spend as much time as possible outside because he was not able to do so before. Furthermore, he explains that he loves working for Ciel because he does not give him injections, put him up against his friends in a death match, or lock him in a cage. He was experimented on to increase physical strength before the events of the story until he was rescued by Sebastian; Sebastian offered Finnian a good salary for his services, but Finnian only wanted to go outside.  In the anime, he develops an infatuation for Angela because of her kindness and beauty until he sees her true dominatrix personality. At the conclusion of the first season of the anime, it was unknown whether he survived, although it was noted he was breathing before he collapsed. In the second season, he is revealed to have survived. Like Bardroy and Mey-Rin, he provides much of the comic relief.  &#60;ref name=&#34;amazonCD&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;Character&#38;Cast&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;EngCastBlog&#34;/&#62;</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Mey-Rin</b> </dt></dl>
<p>  is a clumsy maid whose glasses do nothing to improve her clumsiness. However, she refuses to purchase a new pair as they are the first thing Ciel bought for her. Sebastian believes her main problem is her intelligence and not her poor eyesight. She has a crush on Sebastian as she blushes whenever she is in his presence and is even clumsier when Sebastian is watching. In the anime, she fantasizes about being close to him. She is rather superstitious but admits to having a soft spot for scary stories. Mey-Rin used to be a sniper who did not use a scope, due to her sharp far-sighted vision. The glasses she wears help limit her vision so she doesn&#39;t get distracted from her work. She is also physically fit as she can use a sniper rifle like a hand gun and keeps hundreds loaded at once to decrease reload time. At the conclusion of the first season of the anime, it was unknown whether she survived, although it was noted she was breathing before she collapsed. In the second season, she is revealed to have survived. Like Bardroy and Finnian she provides much of the comic relief.  &#60;ref name=&#34;amazonCD&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;Character&#38;Cast&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;EngCastBlog&#34;/&#62;</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Tanaka</b> </dt></dl>
<p>  is the house steward who has served under the former Phantomhive Head. He was present when Ciel&#39;s parents were killed and was stabbed in the back trying to protect Ciel. As a result, he rarely talks or does any work. Sebastian seems to respect him the most out of all the staff. He is usually seen drinking from a Japanese tea cup. Despite his appearance, Tanaka is capable of killing intruders effortlessly. Prior to Sebastian&#39;s appointment as Ciel&#39;s butler, Tanaka served as the head butler of the Phantomhive household, for both Ciel&#39;s father and Ciel. In the manga, when Sebastian is apparently murdered, Ciel appoints Tanaka as the head butler again, a position he fulfills nearly as well as Sebastian. In the anime, he is commonly in a <a href="" title="super deformed">super deformed</a> form. When he is not, he is as capable a servant as Sebastian. As the series progresses, he is seen less often in a super deformed form. He is voiced by <a href="" title="Shunji Fujimura">Shunji Fujimura</a> in the anime adaption and <a href="" title="Mugihito">Mugihito</a> on the drama CD and <a href="" title="Robert Bruce Elliott">R Bruce Elliott</a> in the English dub.&#60;ref name=&#34;amazonCD&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;Character&#38;Cast&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;EngCastBlog&#34;/&#62;</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Snake</b> </dt></dl>
<p>As a snake handler, Snake was the latest First Tier member to the Noah&#39;s Arc Circus. He is always seen with at least one snake draped around his shoulders and has distinct snake skin patterns covering various patches all over his body. His sentences always end with &#34;said Oscar&#34; (or a name of one of his many snakes) indicating he is uncomfortable when communicating with others unless through his pets. Snake was taken in as a &#39;brother&#39; after the First Tiered members freed him from a traveling freak show. He had vowed to avenge his dead siblings after Ciel and Sebastian had disposed of them all, leaving him alone again. Snake tracked down the Phantomhive Mansion using the clothes Smile left behind and a little unexpected help from Prince Soma. After the murder cases within the mansion were solved, Snake was revealed as the 13th guest caught by Sebastian while hiding on the mansion grounds in an attempt to take Ciel&#39;s life. Instead of killing him, Ciel welcomed him as an addition to his servants, making him the footman of the Phantomhive Mansion.  </p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Pluto</b> </dt></dl>
<p>Appearing in the anime adaption,  , also known as the Demon Hound, is a large dog that terrorizes the town of Houndsworth until Sebastian tames him and brings him to the Phantomhive Estate. He can breathe fire, walk through barriers and shape-shift into a human. As a human, he still retains dog-like behaviour. Although Sebastian hates dogs, Pluto has taken a liking to him and only listens to Sebastian&#39;s orders. He has ties to the organization that killed Ciel&#39;s parents, as he is seen resting by the feet of a member licking his hand and has been with Angela prior to living at the Phantomhive Estate. When Ash uses him to set fire to the Estate and burn London, Ciel orders his staff to kill Pluto. He is voiced by Takafumi Yamaguchi in the anime adaption and <a href="" title="Zach Bolton">Z. Charles Bolton</a> in the English dub of the anime.&#60;ref name=&#34;Character&#38;Cast&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;EngCastBlog&#34;/&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Nobles">Nobles</span></h3>

<dl>
<dt><b>Madame Red</b> </dt></dl>
<p> , born  , was Ciel&#39;s aunt. As her title suggests, she was known for her red appearance and clothing. Initially she hated her red hair, which she inherited from her father, until Ciel&#39;s father, Vincent, said he liked it. Angelina fell in love with him, but became distraught when she found out her sister was marrying him. Madame Red later married Baron Barnett, who treated her lovingly and gently, stating that he does not mind that she harbors feelings for another. She obtained a medical license against the wishes of her parents and practiced at the <a href="" title="Royal London Hospital">Royal London Hospital</a>. After a carriage accident in which her husband was killed, her womb and unborn child had to be removed. This causes her great strife as a doctor because she regularly performs <a href="" title="abortions">abortions</a> on <a href="" title="prostitutes">prostitutes</a> because they believe having a child was troublesome. Unable to bear her misery at ending so many pregnancies when she herself wants one so badly, she begins to kill her patients with Grell Sutcliff and the two become known as <a href="" title="Jack the Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>. However, she cannot kill Ciel because she sees him as her own son. This causes Grell to turn on her and kill her.  &#60;ref name=&#34;amazonCD&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;Character&#38;Cast&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Elizabeth Ethel Cordelia Middleford</b> </dt></dl>
<p>  is the daughter of Marchioness Frances Midford and is both fiancee and cousin by marriage of Ciel Phantomhive. Elizabeth is often called &#34;Lizzy&#34; for short, and has green eyes, blond hair, and is usually seen in a red dress, or a pink coat. She also tends to wear flat-heeled shoes so as to not appear taller than Ciel when they are together. Lizzie adores cute things, dancing, and most importantly Ciel, whom she has known all her life. She loves Ciel with all her heart and wishes to see him smile again. She tries to only look cute in front of Ciel because of a comment he made about Elizabeth&#39;s mother being &#34;a strong wife&#34; and that it scares him. While it looks as though she can not hold her own in combat, in chapter 57 of the manga it was revealed that she can defend herself and fence similar to her mother (even use two swords simultaneously) when she was about to be killed by zombies, much to Ciel and Sebastian&#39;s surprise. In Chapter 58 it&#39;s said by an on looker that Elizabeth&#39;s older brother is rumored to be a &#34;Genius with a Sword&#34;, but as it turns out, Elizabeth is the true genius.  &#60;ref name=Character&#38;Cast /&#62;&#60;ref name=EngCastBlog /&#62;  </p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Lau and Ran-Mao</b> </dt></dl>
<p>  is a Chinese noble, President of the British Branch of a Chinese trading company, and friend to the Phantomhive family. He is actually the head of the Shanghai Mafia <a href="" title="Qing Bang">Qing Bang (Green Gang in Chinese)</a> and runs an <a href="" title="opium">opium</a> den. He is always smiling and his eyes are always closed except for brief moments in episodes fifteen and twenty. Lau often agrees to things before learning what is happening and jumps into conversations with helpful information only to later state he has no idea. He is also unaware his antics appear strange to others. However, he can be very coldblooded and cryptic, willing to go further than Ciel would, such as having Lord West and his wife killed because he knew they&#39;d try to cheat again. He is often seen with his personal assassin  , a Chinese, doll-like girl referred to as his sister, although not by blood. Although she very rarely speaks and is portrayed as emotionless, she is very loyal to him, later revealed to be his personal assassin. In the anime adaption, Lau and Ran-Mao are defeated by Ciel and Sebastian after they use the Earl&#39;s company to store and sell <a href="" title="White Lady">Lady Blanc</a> opium in the guise of candy. Lau and Ran-Mao then throw themselves into the <a href="" title="River Thames">River Thames</a>. They have shown to have survived this in Season 2, and oddly back on good terms with the Phantomhive family.    &#60;ref name=&#34;Character&#38;Cast&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;EngCastBlog&#34;/&#62;</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Prince Soma</b> </dt></dl>
<p>Prince   is a seventeen-year-old Indian <a href="" title="prince">prince</a>. Unlike Ciel, he is spoiled and uses his parent&#39;s fortune for his personal needs and blames all of his problems on others. He bestowed his affections on  , a beautiful maidservant who had served at his palace in India since his birth. He saw her as an older sister. However, she came to hate him due to his arrogance and ran away to England with Lord Harold West, a trader in Indian goods, to become a rich wife, rather than an ordinary cook bound to her social class. During the course of his time in England, Soma begins to see things in a different perspective, realizing that he is blaming problems he caused on others. After learning Meena hated him for his ignorance, Prince Soma decided to stay with Ciel and learn how to act as a gentleman and even proclaims to be Ciel&#39;s best friend. He does not know that Meena and Lord West were both killed by Ran-mao on Lau&#39;s orders after they lost the curry contest. Shortly after, Ciel has him and Agni manage his property in London, in order to keep them out of his way. In the Anime, he and Agni are seen on the streets handing out <a href="" title="curry bread">curry bread</a> to the poor. &#60;ref name=&#34;Character&#38;Cast&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref name=&#34;EngCastBlog&#34;/&#62;</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Agni</b> </dt></dl>
<p>  is the servant of Prince Soma, whom he sees and worships as a god. Agni was once a nobleman named Arshad (in Indonesia: Arsyad) born into the Brahman Clan, one of the highest <a href="" title="clan">clans</a> in India which was allowed to serve God.  Agni (Arsyad) used his powers and wealth for his own desires to the point that he was to be <a href="" title="hanged">hanged</a> for his crimes. Before he was to die, Prince Soma offered him a new life, shedding his former self. He is able to fight on a par with Sebastian while using a <a href="" title="Foil (fencing)">fencing foil</a>, a feat which briefly makes Ciel wonder if he is a reaper until Sebastian confirms he is a human. The source of his martial prowess comes from his devotion to Prince Soma. Unlike Sebastian, he is able to see the good in the Phantomhive manor staff and assign them tasks where their skills will be of use. He is known as the &#34;Right Hand of God&#34; for his god-like skill at making <a href="" title="curry">curry</a>. He betrays Prince Soma and becomes the chef for a curry contest for Lord West to keep him from revealing to Soma that Meena ran away and hated the prince. Later, Agni reconciles with the prince. He is staying in the Phantomhive manor to learn to become a better servant from Sebastian, and even calls Sebastian his friend, something that surprises Sebastian as no one has ever called him that before, though this does not stop him from ignoring Sebastian&#39;s attempts to prevent him from turning himself in for his crimes. Sebastian also takes Agni&#39;s advice on taking care of Ciel, much to the younger boy&#39;s annoyance.  &#60;ref name=&#34;Character&#38;Cast&#34;/&#62;</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Grim_Reapers">Grim Reapers</span></h3>
<p>Grim Reapers are in charge of deciding whether a soul is to live on or to die. So far, four Reapers have been introduced: Grell Sutcliff, Ronald Knox, William T. Spears, and a retired reaper, the Undertaker. Grell is the first reaper who is introduced to the series. Each reaper wields a scythe (some of which should not even have existed during that time period, such as a chainsaw or lawn mower.) Grell meets Madame Red and forges a partnership with her. Grell and Madame Red kill prostitutes and are known as <a href="" title="Jack the Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>. William punishes Grell by confiscating his scythe for infringing upon three laws that must be followed by reapers; Grell killed people not on the &#39;to die&#39; list, wielded an illegally modified Death Scythe, and gave information that was not to be given (as to not be killed by Sebastian, he told him that he knew who killed Ciel&#39;s parents). Grell does not reappear in the manga until chapter 55. Undertaker, a retired reaper, also appears in the anime. He is highly respected by Spears. Every Grim Reaper introduced in the anime thus far wears glasses, for they all are horribly nearsighted. It has been said in the manga that once they take them off, they are officially retired.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Grell Sutcliff</b> </dt></dl>

<p> </p>
<p>Grell Sutcliff is a flamboyant <a href="#O" title="Glossary_of_anime_and_manga">okama</a> who initially worked as Madame Red&#39;s butler. Grell and Madame Red formed a partnership in which they killed <a href="" title="prostitutes">prostitutes</a>. Grell was portrayed initially as a meek brunette with round glasses. He was often clumsy, and failed horribly at making tea. Grell acts very flamboyant in his true form and uses feminine speech.</p>
<p>He is a redheaded (literally having red hair), hot-tempered Grim Reaper. He usually wears a vest, heels, a red-striped bow tie and a coat that he took from Madame Red&#39;s corpse. Grell, like all Reapers, has neon green and yellow eyes. He is the only Grim Reaper shown who has sharp, shark-like teeth. Grell wields a Death Scythe in the form of a chainsaw. It was illegally modified, and William confiscates the chainsaw from Grell, giving him scissors instead. Grell is originally seen as an antagonist, however appears to just take a liking to killing people. Grell killed Madame Red when she refused to kill Ciel, seeing Ciel as her own son. Grell is respectfully referred to as &#39;sempai&#39; by Ronald, however William just calls him &#39;Grell&#39;. Grell seems to be attracted to Sebastian (to Sebastian&#39;s dismay) like many of the other women in the story. Grell is rather cunning, and somewhat sadistic. Grell often tried to commit suicide when he made a mistake as a butler. Grell did this so often that the Phantomhive staff gave up on trying to stop him. He is voiced by <a href="" title="Jun Fukuyama">Jun Fukuyama</a> in the anime and drama CD and by Daniel Fredrick in the English Dub. Grell&#39;s last name is similar to the Yorkshire Ripper, <a href="" title="Peter Sutcliffe">Peter Sutcliffe</a>, known for killing thirteen women.</p>

<dt><b>Undertaker</b> </dt></dl>
<p>  
The Undertaker is a former Grim Reaper as well as a funeral director in England. He also works as an informant for the Phantomhive family.</p>
<p>He is seen draped in a long black robe that covers his hands and nearly every inch of his body besides his face. Even then his head is topped with a very long black top hat. He also has long silver hair, with a few spare braids throughout. Scars also cover his face, neck and pinky (although it is not mentioned how he got them) Another feature are his long black fingernails. He is voiced by <a href="" title="Junichi Suwabe">Junichi Suwabe</a> in Japanese and <a href="" title="John Swasey">John Swasey</a> in English.</p>
<p>The Undertaker takes joy in frightening people, and loves jokes. He is often doing strange and questionable things like hiding in coffins or eating treats that resemble bones. His appearances in the anime vary from the manga, as many characters do throughout Black Butler. </p>

<dl>
<dt><b>William T. Spears</b> </dt></dl>
<p> 
William T. Spears is part of the management ward of the Grim Reaper Dispatch. William&#39;s features include groomed black hair, kept to perfection, black glasses with a silver rim on the side, neon green eyes, tight lips, and a stern gaze. He seems to always complain about how he will have &#39;overtime&#39; again due to Grell or Ronald&#39;s mishaps or calamities. William has a hatred for demons, especially Sebastian, who seems to be his rival whenever they meet. William likes to comment on how Sebastian has become a dog with a &#39;collar&#39; around his neck, which prevents him from being like all the other mutts running around. William seems to hate demons because they are always stealing the souls the Grim Reapers harvest and take great care to organize. He gets special attention from Grell Sutcliff, who, in fact, is attracted to William and always tries to get close to him whenever he can. When William finds Grell fighting in an alley with Sebastian using an unregistered weapon (Grell&#39;s chainsaw) he takes the saw and gives him a pair of red scissors instead, making Grell agitated at him. William&#39;s Death Scythe is a pair of garden trimmers in which he relies to straighten his glasses and hit Grell on the head with. They are always by his side, and you can see them in almost every scene, whether in the anime or manga adaption. William always comes prepared and seems to be always watching and/or observing the things around him, as this reflects on his pure cold logic about the events concerning his career. He is voiced by <a href="" title="Noriaki Sugiyama">Noriaki Sugiyama</a> in Japanese and <a href="" title="Barry Yandell">Barry Yandell</a> in English. Will likes to appear smart in front of his enemies, and even if some may call this bluffing, William only sees this as protecting his inner knowledge, which also helps to get information out of the people he needs to observe from afar.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Ronald Knox</b> </dt></dl>
<p> 
Ronald Knox is a subordinate under Grell Sutcliff. He seems to be rather laid back and easy-going. He apparently has problems with arriving on time, yet he seems interested in finding a way to accomplish his job quickly.</p>
<p>His Death Scythe has been modified to look like a lawnmower, which he states was done on the principle of avoiding overtime work. It contains four circular blades and two straight blades running horizontally below the circular ones. It has two wheels that allow him to maneuver it and a small cord that allows him to pull a trigger on the handle to start the Death Scythe.</p>
<p>Ronald has thick, wavy hair with a small cowlick just to the right of the part in his hair. He wears thick-framed, pentagonal-shaped glasses and a watch on his right wrist. He dresses in a suit, tie, gloves, and dress shoes.</p>
<p>Ronald Knox initially appears helping William T. Spears in fighting Sebastian Michaelis. Their motive to do so, despite unclear, is in relation to the recent movement of souls. Sebastian jams Ronald&#39;s Death Scythe using his trademark cutlery, but Ronald manages to repair the damage done to it and send it crashing down on Sebastian and William. William is disgruntled at this, but Ronald is indifferent. He is amused when William abandons chasing Sebastian after he knocks his glasses off of his face, and William proceeds to lecture him for almost hurting him with his scythe and for not knowing the importance of glasses. He is voiced by <a href="" title="Kenn (Japanese actor)">Kenn</a> in Japanese and Joel McDonald in English.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Noah.27s_Ark_Circus">Noah&#39;s Ark Circus</span></h3>


<dl>
<dt><b>Joker</b></dt></dl>
<p>  is the leader of the circus when it is traveling and serves Baron Kelvin as a butler when he is at the manor. He is recognized by his prosthetic skeleton arm and is initially portrayed as a very goofy person. However, he is actually strict and serious. Although he does not agree with some of Baron Kelvin&#39;s decisions, he follows every order given to him because he wants to protect his &#34;brothers and sisters&#34; in the workhouse, whom Kelvin claims he looks after if they all do what they are told. He, like every first tier performer, refers to Baron Kelvin as Father because the Baron took him off the streets as a child and raised him in addition to providing artificial limbs. Joker is unaware of the fact that the bones of the kidnapped children are used by Doctor as material for the prosthetics, nor did he know that the workhouse never existed. He dies of blood loss, having Sebastian sever his other arm, as he attempted to defend &#39;Father&#39; from Ciel.</p>
<p>An incarnation of Joker briefly shows up in episodes 10-12 of Season 1 of the anime in the form of Drocell the Butler, a reanimated corpse turned into a puppet by an unknown master, who kidnapped a lot of young girls along with Lady Elizabeth and turned their bodies into lifeless dolls that he could manipulate with his organ musical box.&#60;!-- Ref: 35 --&#62;</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Baron Kelvin</b></dt></dl>
<p>  is the creator of the Noah&#39;s Ark Circus and is referred to as &#34;Father&#34; by the tier one performers. Except for his left eye, his entire face is covered by bandages. He seems to have an obsession with children and uses his circus as a way to kidnap them. He then <a href="" title="brainwashing">brainwashes</a> them and has them act as his servants and in his private circus. However, he does not care for their well-being and even finds it entertaining when they die gruesomely while performing dangerous stunts in the show without any training. </p>
<p>He had originally been a kind philanthropist, though upon meeting Ciel as a young child with his family, became infatuated with him. He would even blush and say how it would be like a dream to have Ciel beside him. He was driven to madness, thinking himself unworthy to talk to any of them, and ugly in Ciel&#39;s presence. He secretly hired the &#34;Doctor&#34; and underwent many plastic surgeries to make himself more appealing for Ciel, only to believe it was all a waste when he heard the Phantomhives had been murdered. He had also begun kidnapping other beautiful children, and even seems to have gotten involved somehow with the mysterious organization that captured Ciel after his parents&#39; deaths, most likely via the Doctor. </p>
<p>Kelvin also funds the Doctor&#39;s prosthetic limb research and upon discovering that Ciel was still alive, recreates the room where the organization caged, tortured, and branded Ciel before trying to sacrifice him in some kind of cruel ritual. This is what enabled Ciel to summon Sebastian in the first place. After learning this, Ciel kills him and orders Sebastian to burn his mansion.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Doctor</b></dt></dl>
<p>  is the kind, <a href="" title="wheelchair">wheelchair</a>-bound doctor who cares for the performers of the circus. However, this is later revealed to be a ruse as he really can walk and is quite <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/sadism">sadistic</a>. He hand-carves the prosthetic limbs used by some of the first tier performers from an unknown strong material that he is developing through his research, funded by Baron Kelvin. This material is later revealed to be a special bone china made from the bones of the kidnapped children. He has Kelvin use his power and money to provide him with the resources he needs to perfect his craft and has him kidnap children that he uses. He seems to have some kind of connection with the organization that originally kidnapped Ciel when he was younger.
He is killed by Sebastian under Ciel&#39;s orders.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Beast</b></dt></dl>
<p>Beast is one of the leading characters in the circus ark. Beast is a busty woman, with a well endowed chest and curves. Her eyes are on Joker, whom she has been with since the  circus started. Being picked off the street as well, Jokers dedication to &#34;father&#34; as they call him, doesn&#39;t reach as far for her. When she speaks of him to Sebastian, she uses a bit of malice. Beast has been in love with Joker, for a long time. Only her love is unrequited because Joker see&#39;s her as just a sister to protect along with the rest of their family. 
Ciel and his Butler, Sebastian Michaelis infiltrated the Circus to find information on their &#34;father&#34;  and his involvement in the kidnapping of young children by Queen Victoria&#39;s Order. Ciel poses as a poor boy who used to work in a wealthy home and who used to steal. (As he lied to Freckles about why he was there to gain her sympathy). On one of the nights that Sebastian had staked out to use Beast as a last resort on obtaining the information on &#34;Father&#34;, Beast had just confessed her love to Joker only to be rejected and left feeling heart broken.
Feeling sad  and grievous, Sebastian uses this as a chance to take advantage of Beast, seducing her and promising her a night of comfort, to forget how she was feeling. Sebastian uses sweet words and his sex appeal to make her agree. Beast leads Sebastian (Known as Black in the Circus) to her tent and there, Sebastian fulfills his promise and gets all the information he needs on &#34;father&#34; from her.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Dagger</b></dt></dl>
<p>Dagger (ダガー Dagā) is referred to as the Noah&#39;s Ark Circus bulls-eye knife thrower who never misses his mark. Dagger appears as young and slim. He is missing his right leg, and has an artificial one made by Doctor that he wears instead. Dagger is a flamboyant, dramatic, energetic boy who is nearly constantly smiling. He seems to have a great love, bordering on obsession, for Beast, whom he always refers to as &#34;Sis&#34; or &#34;Big Sis.&#34; He is always willing to express his feelings for her, frequently serenading her or offering her gifts. When Sebastian Michaelis ended up too close to her by touching her leg, he was very upset, because he hadn&#39;t touched her yet. He continues these acts, even when Beast is not around and despite no indication of interest from her. He seems to very much enjoy the company of others, as shown when he encourages Ciel Phantomhive  and Sebastian to make new friends, too. When he doesn&#39;t understand what people are saying, he tends to assume they&#39;re joking. He is only infrequently shown to be serious, such as when getting ready to go on a mission for Baron Kelvin, but even then, he is quick to make jokes. Even while dying, he is shown smiling. </p>
<p>Like the other first-tier members, he lived in an alley in the East End. He has been missing his right leg since birth, a commonality that linked him with the others. One day, Baron Kelvin found them in the alley, and invited them to come live at his mansion.
After some time there, they decided to start a circus, and Joker gave him the stage name Dagger, which he didn&#39;t initially appear to be very excited about. His real name is not known. </p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Peter</b></dt></dl>
<p>Peter (ピーター Pītā) works with Wendy as a trapeze artist in the Noah&#39;s Ark Circus. Together, they are introduced as the &#34;gasp-inducing flying blanco.&#34; Peter appears as a young boy with short, thick, blond hair. Peter is prone to violence, angers easily and frequently makes rude, sarcastic remarks. He appears to have no problems with killing other individuals, or even striking or threatening other members of the circus. Despite his tendency to anger easily, he is shown to be capable of making quick decisions, such as when he abandons attacking Finnian  to take out a more serious threat. He is also extremely intelligent, as demonstrated by his ability to quickly deduce the reason for the Phantomhive&#39;s large gun collection.
He may bear some ill will toward Doll, as he is only seen insulting her. He may also not be very fond of Snake, as he threatens his life as well. However, he does seem to care deeply about Wendy, as he is almost always by her side, and even leaves a circus performance to sit with her when she&#39;s injured. He also seems to respect Jumbo, as he listens when Jumbo tells him things, and is visibly distressed when Jumbo is killed. </p>
<p>Peter grew up with the other first-tier members in an alley in the East End. Joker stated that they came together because they all had a similar problem. In Peter&#39;s and Wendy&#39;s case, they are trapped in children&#39;s bodies. (This may or may not be a reference to Peter Pan, where the children stayed like that.) It is because of this that although they appear to be the youngest of the first-tier circus members, they may actually be significantly older. This is implied when Peter reprimands Doll for being a child, despite appearing to be younger than her.</p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Wendy</b></dt></dl>
<p>Wendy (ウエンディ Uendei) works with Peter as a trapeze artist in the Noah&#39;s Ark Circus. Together, they are introduced as the &#34;gasp-inducing flying blanco.&#34; Wendy appears as a small child with large, red eyes. She wears her brown hair up in two buns and wears a small, black crown. She initially seems soft-spoken, and usually defers to Peter to do most of the talking. However, when she does speak, she presents herself in a mature manner, such as when she comforts Beast. Like the other first-tier circus members, she seems very concerned with completing the tasks set out to them by Baron Kelvin, and seems to have no qualms about kidnapping or murdering individuals while accomplishing these tasks. She cares deeply about the other first-tier circus members, perhaps more than she cares about Baron Kelvin, and seems to be most attached to Peter, as she is almost always in his presence. Wendy grew up in an alley in the East End, referred to as a gutter, with the other first-tier circus members, less Snake. </p>
<p>Wendy and Peter share the same problem, which is that they have been in bodies that appear like children&#39;s forever. (This may or may not be a reference to Peter Pan, where the children stayed like that.) For this reason, even though they appear to be the youngest of the circus members, they may actually be significantly older, which has been hinted at, such as when Peter called Doll, who appears older than both Peter and Wendy, a child. Like the others, they were picked up by Baron Kelvin and went to live at his manor. After some time, they decided to start a circus, and Wendy and Peter formed the trapeze act. It is not known if Wendy is her real name or a stage name. </p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Jumbo</b></dt></dl>
<p>Jumbo (ジャンボ Janbo) is the Noah&#39;s Ark Circus fire eater. He starts the shows of the circus with one shot of fire. Jumbo, as his name would indicate, is an extremely large man, who seems to have a slight hunch. He is bald and has red tattoos of fire that wraps around the back of his head, on his shoulders and on his forearms. Jumbo seems to be the voice of reason among the circus members. He seems to be very level-headed and is not prone to giving into his emotions. Nonetheless, he is extremely kind and generous, once stopping his work to help Dagger play with the other children in the past. Even though he is willing to kill people in order to carry out his orders, he seems to be genuinely unhappy about having to do so. </p>
<p>It is stated that his problem is that he was raised too harshly and was deformed by his parents. Like the others, he was picked up by Baron Kelvin and came to live in his manor. When the others decided to start a circus, he became the fire eater. </p>

<dl>
<dt><b>Doll</b></dt></dl>
<p>Doll (ドール Dōru) is a first-tier member of the Noah&#39;s Ark Circus, and holds the position of tightrope walker, who is initially introduced as the princess of the circus with a death-defying tightrope walk. However, when not performing, she pretends to be a new, male, second-tier member named Freckles (そばかす Sobakasu). When first introduced, she appears to be a youthful male with freckles dotting her face across her nose, brown hair, and blue eyes. When she is dressed in her performing clothes, she wears a wig that appears to be made of white flowers with two feathers sticking out the left side and beads dangling from the end of her wig. It also is worn so as to cover her left eye. Doll is friendly and welcoming, making conversation with Ciel Phantomhive  after they were named tent mates, and appears to view him as a friend quickly. She easily forgives him when he claims he was stealing items, but lightly reprimands him for doing so. She seems to view it as a necessity to look after him, waking him up when he oversleeps, sharing her food when he does not get enough, and attempting to teach him how to be a better performer. She is a bit naive, though, easily believing lies Ciel tells her, something that the other circus performers have reprimanded her for.</p>
<p>It is shown that the reason why she pretends to be a male, second-tier performer is because she sleeps better when she is sharing a room with someone else, something the first-tier performers do not have to do. She seems pleased when Ciel allows her to continue her charade as Freckles, and is even seen climbing into his bed when he was sick to keep him company. The other first-tier members also seem okay with her pretending to be Freckles, as they refer to her as a male when she is acting as him.</p>
<p>She does not appear to be modest, as shown when she attempts to get Ciel to take a bath, offering to wash his back for him, and when she allows him to touch her chest to prove that she is female. She even offers to allow him to &#34;take a peek downstairs,&#34; as she words it. She is exceedingly loyal to the other first-tier circus performers, perhaps even more so than she is to Baron Kelvin, as she appears to be more distraught about news of Joker&#39;s death than she is about his. She views all of them as family, calling the other first-tier members brothers and sisters and calling Baron Kelvin &#34;Father.&#34; </p>
<p>It is said that the reason for the loss of her left eye is because her parents raised her too harshly and deformed her. She banded together with the others, because they had no hope of getting a job to earn money and even as thieves, were not very successful.</p>
<p>One day, Baron Kelvin found them in the alley and allowed them to come live at his estate, where they lived in luxury. Sometime thereafter, they decide to create a circus. Joker gave them all stage names, including Doll, who initially tries to refuse the name, saying it does not fit her. Joker dismisses her complaint, saying that of course it did, because she is their &#34;cute little sister.&#34; Her birth name is unknown.</p>

<dd>Earl Grey appears as guest at Ciel&#39;s private party, where he is later revealed to be the murderer of Siemens by the order of the Queen.  He appears quite care free on most occasions but this can change at the slightest provocation.  Possessing a great love of food and an enormous appetite, Grey is always seen with his sword, which he uses on a number of occasions to slice open the doors in Ciel&#39;s house.  Despite appearing as a comical character, he is prone to losing his temper and becoming violent, as seen when he kills Woodley in a fit of rage instead of just arresting him.</dd></dl>

<dt>Earl  </dt>
<dd>Born on November 5, 1875. A blonde child who appears to be carefree, but is actually quite morbid and manipulative. He is also commonly thought to be bipolar, as he has rather dramatic mood swings, going from dancing with a smile to a bitter frown saying, &#34;Eat shit,&#34;; however, this is not officially stated and is mere speculation and interpretation of character. He mistreats his servant, Hannah, and he is shown gouging out her left eye in the first episode as well as does actions simply to see if it will annoy his servants. Initially, it was thought that he was kidnapped after birth, thus resulting in his mother&#39;s suicide. Alois was kept in an unknown village for some time where he was worked like a slave, until one day when all the people in that village were killed, including a younger boy whom he considered as his little brother. He was found by his father, but suffered sexual abuse. The first episode showed him getting out of a bed with his father, Alois&#39;s body discolored by bruises. His father died of the plague. Alois&#39; contract is found on his tongue, having been sealed there by a spider. Unlike Ciel, who thinks of his Demon Butler as his knight/servant, Alois is dependent on Claude, clinging to him and ordering him to not leave him alone in darkness (Alois is afraid of the dark because of his past). Also unlike Ciel, who hides his contract, Alois often displays his by showing off his tongue as much as possible. He is voiced by <a href="" title="Nana Mizuki">Nana Mizuki</a> in Japanese and by <a href="" title="Luci Christian">Luci Christian</a> in English.

However, Alois  is his opposite - appearing to be energetic he is psychologically scarred and pathologically abusive and calculative. He is also known as bipolar. Although his personality is often said to be too &#34;needy,&#34; and often &#34;incomplete&#34; when compared with Ciel&#39;s hard-intent determination, Alois had been praised numerous times as the epitome of complex logic. Alois is symbolized via light colors such as gold, red and white (his normal attire is dark purple) whereas Ciel is symbolized via dark colors like black, violet and blue (his normal attire is dark blue). Their personalities, however, conflict with their imagery. They also have opposite tolerances for pain: while Ciel was able to grab a blade without flinching, Alois becomes completely hysterical at the sight of his own blood. In Episode 7 Alois is horribly stabbed at the stomach by Ciel and saved by Claude. In the beginning of episode 8 he orders Hannah to take him to Ciel and she takes him by a carriage where his past soon becomes apparent.</p>
<p>In Episode 8 Alois was killed by Claude, and his past revealed. Alois Trancy&#39;s real name was Jim Macken. His younger brother, Luka, and he were abandoned orphans. Alois became angry with the people in his village because the villagers mistreated his brother and him despite them being alone, and so wished for their deaths. Luka believed in Jim and stated that his older brother could always do anything he wanted; Jim told Luka to follow him for protection, to which Luka responded: &#34;Yes, your Highness.&#34; One night when Jim and Luka went to get water from the river, they saw a dead body floating in it, and the distant village in flames. Upon the discovery that all of the villagers had died, Jim burst in frenzied joy. Though Luka was initially happy, he became slightly concerned for his brother. While stealing from the villagers, Jim got an odd feeling that he was being watched and called out to Luka to return; however, he found Luka dead. After a while Jim was brought along with other boys to Trancy, who was revealed to be a violent pedophile. Jim was initially rejected by Trancy as he was said to have filthy looking eyes. Jim later overheard a boy talking about summoning a fairy. Seeking out this fairy, he instead summons Claude, creating the contract in what appeared to be a strange dream ritual. Jim uses his sex appeal to gain Trancy&#39;s trust and his estate. Claude tells him that Sebastian had destroyed the village upon the orders of his former master. Ciel Phantomhive is Sebastian&#39;s new master. Jim, now Alois Trancy, decided to take revenge on Sebastian by taking Ciel and delivering an agony upon him worse than death. </p>
<p>As Jim was bleeding Grell comes to take his soul but he ordered Hannah to fight Grell. While crawling away, images of his past come in the scenes where he threw plates at Claude for staring at him, slapping him for being too obedient and finally, wanting him to keep on saying &#34;Yes, your Highness,&#34; like his brother, Luka, did long ago. Jim was bleeding and attracted the attention of a wolf. Claude came and rescued Jim from the wolf and Jim was overjoyed. Claude smiles (in the previous episode Alois found this disgusting, this time, he became frozen by the action) and sits down and stares at Jim&#39;s face but then kills him commenting that a soul like his, which can give (platonic) love/respect/admiration to a menial butler as himself, does not stir his appetite. However, he does state that Alois&#39;s does still have a use. He takes Alois&#39;s ring and puts it inside his jacket stating he will always be by his side and then leaves as even Grell has no problems with his actions.</p>
<p>After a moment, Hannah sits before Alois&#39;s deceased body and whispered to him that she would finally give the boy what he wished for. It is revealed that Hannah had a substantial role in Alois&#39;s life all along, and she—though mistreated by him—loved Alois more than anyone else. Also that she had a plan to grant Alois&#39;s wish; for everything to be as simple as he and his brother, Luka, happy together. When Alois&#39;s soul is placed in Ciel, it is Hannah who re-awakens Alois&#39;s consciousness. It is from that point on that she told Alois that he still has both she and Luka. Alois then realized that he should have been loving Hannah the whole time instead of so desperately trying to gain Claude&#39;s approval and acknowledgement. He tried to give Claude one last chance when he and Sebastian race each other through a maze. He even allowed Claude the handicap of getting every answer in the race trivia correct, only for Claude to reveal that he only used Alois and never acknowledged his soul as worthy to be eaten. Alois finally snapped and claimed that he hated Claude and that everyone who used him or wouldn&#39;t acknowledge him should die. Hannah comforts Alois and they formed a new contract. As Claude and Sebastian arrive at the end of the maze, a broken Alois told Claude that he just wanted to be loved (in a sense, Alois basically stated that he wanted someone, anyone to love him and acknowledge his existence). Then, Alois/Ciel fell unconscious as Hannah held him and put the butlers up for a duel. Sebastian won and killed Claude, but not before Claude acknowledged that maybe Alois&#39;s soul would have been delicious after all. Now in an inner world, connecting and comunicating with Ciel&#39;s consciousness, Alois became shocked and aware of Claude&#39;s death, relaxed a bit, and then disappears with a smile on his face, leaving Ciel alone. In the end, Hannah approached Claude&#39;s dead body and proclaimed that Alois and Luka would live happily in the afterlife.</p>

<dd>A spectacle wearing Demon Butler who shows no emotion. He does things perfectly and with ease and is shown in the first episode tap-dancing before changing the decorations. He has a similar catchphrase to Sebastian, though instead of saying &#34;Yes, My Lord&#34; he says &#34;Yes, Your Highness&#34;. He also uses a Japanese alternate translation the same way Sebastian does, but his phrase is &#34;I wish to deeply desire you&#34;, alternately translated as &#34;I wish to devour you fully&#34;. He starts to take in interest in Ciel&#39;s soul when he is slapped with Ciel&#39;s bloody hand and gets a taste of the blood left saying, &#34;[Ciel&#39;s soul] knows hatred and wants revenge, yet is pure and innocent.&#34; He is voiced by <a href="" title="Takahiro Sakurai">Takahiro Sakurai</a> in Japanese and by <a href="" title="Jason Douglas">Jason Douglas</a> in English.</dd></dl>

<p>He is a <a href="" title="foil (literature)">foil</a> to Sebastian Michaelis - he seems to be more indifferent never showing any emotion. He is more of a perfectionist and likes to criticize Sebastian as he takes methodologies in being a butler too seriously. He also has immense control over the other household servants, who listen to him without failure - for after Alois they take him as their master and he expects them to follow his commands: this is the opposite of Sebastian&#39;s command which is more flexible. Though Alois wants him to be animated he always wears an indifferent mask on his face and unlike Sebastian never seems to attempt to stop his master from doing unjust or inappropriate things. This can be seen in the case that Sebastian once stopped Ciel from slapping Elizabeth as it was a rash decision, however, Claude makes no comment or action against Alois for gouging out Hannah&#39;s eye. It seems no matter whatever psychotic action Alois performs Claude does not intervene in any way to do other actions. Despite the initial appearances Claude is not much devoted to Alois. He sees Alois more as the soul he wants to cultivate and devour (like a cook or a gardener) and the act of butler more as the most suitable method for this. The incident can be seen when Claude is so intoxicated, having tasted Ciel&#39;s blood, that he does not care that Alois is bleeding and even when Alois is screaming at him with words tied to his bond he does not seem to flinch. In the end it can be concluded that Claude is more selfish and ruthless than Sebastian in the sense that he&#39;ll go to any length to taste a soul that is different - this &#34;difference&#34; is discussed by Sebastian and Claude as souls who have a special flavour and possess rare qualities that other souls do not. Ciel and Alois both fall in this category, however, Claude seems to want to taste Ciel&#39;s soul as well much to Sebastian&#39;s disdain.</p>
<p>In Episode 8 Claude shockingly kills Alois Trancy. Alois&#39;s past is revealed - he had summoned Claude in a strange dream ritual where he puts his face to a spider&#39;s web filled with morning dew and soon Claude comes. Alois, who is actually Jim, is trapped in a large web of a spider where there are other dead bodies. Claude comes to him as in the form of a surreal spider and initially at Jim&#39;s hesitation thinks he has no wish but then even without Jim speaking seems to realize his desire. Claude tells Jim that Sebastian former master had ordered him to destroy the village so he did but Sebastian has already consumed him and that Ciel is his current master. Jim wins the favour of Trancy and becomes Alois Trancy and Claude becomes his butler after Trancy &#34;dies&#34; (is killed). Jim decides to get Ciel and deliver a fate to Sebastian worse than death.</p>
<p>As Alois is bleeding and Grell comes for his soul he crawls away as Hannah fights. Claude comes and saves him from being a prey of a wolf. Jim then states that Claude is his Highness and the only one he can trust in the world. Claude sits down and faces Jim and shockingly he puts his hand inside the back of Jim&#39;s head (or as The Kuroshitsuji Wiki suggests crushes his skull), killing him. He then gets up and takes Jim&#39;s ring and states that a soul that can have love/respect/admiration for a menial butler such as himself does not stir his appetite so he tells Jim not to worry as he puts his ring in his pocket, stating that he will always be by Jim&#39;s side. He also comments that Alois&#39;s soul still has a use. Then he leaves as Grell has had no problems with his actions.</p>
<p>The nature of his actions are unclear - Claude has made a deal with Sebastian that he will allow Ciel to target Alois as his enemy and will only go after Ciel for Alois after the revenge is complete - possibly by killing Alois he has made part of his contract possible but what his other actions are now is still unknown.</p>

<p>Alois&#39;s maid and servant. In the first episode of the second season, Hannah gets her left eye gouged out by Alois on the account that she stared at him directly. She is quiet and seems to be very fearful of Alois as he often harms and humiliates her. This is also seen in Episode five when Alois throws a fake crown at her head causing her to bleed. She is very skilled with combat and able to pull weapons <a href="" title="hammerspace">out of nowhere</a>. In Episode 9, It is revealed that she is the Sheath of the legendary sword Laevateinn, and in Episode 8 it is revealed by Grell, as Grell was about to fight with her, that she is a demon. She is voiced by <a href="" title="Aya Hirano">Aya Hirano</a> in Japanese and by <a href="" title="Caitlin Glass">Caitlin Glass</a> in English.</p>
<p>After Claude kills Alois in Episode 8 Hannah comes  and sits on top of his dead body, and cuts at his eye and pressing her face affectionately towards Alois tells him she is giving him what he wants: which can presumed as affection and love. It&#39;s later revealed that she was the demon that made a contract with Alois&#39; brother, Luka. He asked her to grant Alois&#39;s wish to have his village murdered. He later thanked her as she devoured his soul. Hannah&#39;s previous actions seem to have been quite the facade as she reveals later that her eye was already healed. Also, it is revealed that the triplets are her subordinates, not Claude&#39;s. How she came to work with Claude is unknown, however her reasoning might have involved Alois. Hannah awakens Alois&#39; subconscious once his soul was fused with Ciel&#39;s. She tells Alois that he still has both she and Luka. She also proclaims that she loves Alois and he realizes that he should have loved her instead of trying to gain acknowledgement from Claude. After Alois proclaims that everyone who used him should die, Hannah forms a contract with him as she comforts him with her affection. She stays loyal to Alois to the end and states that Alois and Luka will live happily in the afterlife.</p>

<p>The triplets stand by and tend to anything that Claude orders them to do. Their names are Timber (his fringe falls directly to the center), Thompson (his fringe that is swept to the right) and Canterbury (his fringe that is swept to the left). Like Hannah, they appear to be terrified of Alois. Also unlike the Phantomhive servants, they are very skilled in household work. All three are voiced by <a href="" title="Kenichi Suzumura">Kenichi Suzumura</a> in Japanese and by <a href="" title="Scott Freeman (voice actor)">Scott Freeman</a> in English.</p>
<p>They contrast the Phantomhive servants as they seem to have superb control over their combat abilities and are not zany, eccentric or loquacious as Ciel&#39;s household servants. They do seem to talk but rather be confined in their actions to please Alois Trancy. This is shown in the first episode when Trancy gouges out Hannah&#39;s eye and they whisper and try to hide their shock. It is later revealed they too are demons, shown when they are able to survive a spear through their heads and have similar glow to their eyes as Sebastian and Claude. Later it is revealed that they are subordinates to Hannah as they are seen grooming her in Episode 11.</p>
