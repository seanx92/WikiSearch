<p>Vincent Arthur Skullberg, also known as Senator Skull, was once a simple student at school in the state of Florida, he is the main antagonist of the cartoon series. After being toyed several times by delinquents, he trained hard to become a fighter and eventually exacted vengeance against them. Still not satisfied by this, Senator Skull established the Evil Sinistras, a society of rebellious wrestlers who go by principles different from those of the TWF.</p>
<p>When he once lead the Sinistras, he had plans to bring down the Dexteras and rule the planet. But his chances of achieving them are often slim because his camp is often in turmoil (the other Sinistras have no interests in world domination). He quit in Season 3 after using a weather machine against Face-Off Phil, he says it&#39;s Canada. He then become the Sinistras&#39; coach. His reign as leader ended when Bucks Gazillion, who won the third tournament, took charge by bribing all his comrades. In Season 4, at the championship, Senator Skull serves as the protagonist with the other Sinistras to stop Bucks and remove him to the position. Skull fights in Season 5 and takes out Pierre Pamplemousse and Mr.Extremo(rematch), but loses to Cleat Cunningham in the semi-finals.</p>
<p>One of his two signature moves is the Skull&#39;s Revenge Shocker, an attack where he pins down an opponent and then electrocuting them using power from within him. The other one is the Super Skull. Much of this isn&#39;t revealed because it was deliberately censored for some reasons.

Very durable, some wrestlers find it tiring when it comes to landing blows on him. When he isn&#39;t wrestling, The Big Time serves as the trainer for the Sinistras in their headquarters. He is proven to retire in Season 4 after beating Pierre Pamplemousse because Steve threw a chair at Pierre while the Time Bomb was being used (which The Big Time did not like at all).</p>
<p>His signature attack is The Time Bomb. There, he swings left and right as his fans count backwards from 5 to 1. Upon pinning the opponent, an explosion occurs (hence the red mushroom cloud). Though very destructive, a least two wrestlers, Hometown Huck and Tom Cat managed to continue fighting after receiving it (although Tom Cat had help from Pinky, Hometown Huck had no help at all). He is voiced by <a href="" title="Keith Dawkins">Keith Dawkins</a> (Seasons 1 and 2) and <a href="" title="David Wills (voice actor)">David Wills</a> (Season 3).

However, he doesn&#39;t have a desire to rule the world by winning the TWF, but instead making TWF part of his company, Gazillion Incorporated. He becomes the main antagonist on Season 4. Later in season 4, he helps the Sinistras win all their matches, but in Wasabi vs Itsy Bitsy, Unit 19G vs Corbata and James Montgomery Flag vs Big Bad Billy Goatetsky, his plans fail, and the Dexteras win those matches. He had his comeuppance in the Season 4 final when his big plan to win the title through the Visitor such as flying skateboard, obstacles, net and a metal claw, but Billy Batboy got some blueprints and they go to the ladies bathroom and to the control room. The Sinistras fight Steve and the other men and they enter the control room.
