<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b> I can understand categorizing songs that ranked at #1 on a <a href="" title="Billboard Year-End">Billboard Year-End</a> chart, but at the same time, there doesn&#39;t seem to be a precedent for such categories existing. This is more of a &#34;test the waters&#34; CFD than anything else, as I&#39;m kind of on the fence about this one. <a href="" title="User:TenPoundHammer">&#60;span style=&#34;color:green&#34;&#62;Ten Pound Hammer&#60;/span&#62;</a> and his otters • &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/TenPoundHammer">Many otters</a> • <a href="" title="User talk:TenPoundHammer">One hammer</a> • <a href="" title="User:TenPoundHammer/Country">HELP</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 23:47, 13 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<ul>
<li>Well I just thought that songs that were #1&#39;s of the year deserved to be categorized. We have a category for United States Billboard Hot Country Songs #1&#39;s, RPM Country Tracks and Canadian Country Singles #1&#39;s, so why not have a similiar category for the number-one songs of the year? <a href="" title="User:Ryanbstevens">Ryanbstevens</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ryanbstevens">talk</a>) 23:57, 13 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b> <b>Delete</b>. Similar to the <a href="" title="Category:Vice">Category:Vice</a> which was deleted <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Categories for discussion/Log/2009 March 30">here</a>, this category is mostly subjectivity, original research, and POV. Consider some of the choices <a href="" title="Curiosity">Curiosity</a>, <a href="" title="Discipline">Discipline</a>, <a href="" title="Independence">Independence</a>, <a href="" title="Imagination">Imagination</a>, <a href="" title="Rigour">Rigour</a> - are these universally virtuous? <a href="" title="Detachment">Detachment</a> and <a href="" title="Empathy">Empathy</a> (or <a href="" title="Sympathy">Sympathy</a>, also there) which are close to opposites are both in the category. Same with <a href="" title="Openness">Openness</a> and <a href="" title="Discretion">Discretion</a>. <a href="" title="Eccentricity (behavior)">Eccentricity (behavior)</a> is also there. Perhaps considered virtuous by some (like criminal defense attorneys with insanity pleas in their pockets), but this is not a universal.  <a href="" title="Misanthropy">Misanthropy</a> is also so classified, probably with someone&#39;s tongue firmly in cheek. Anyway, there is no OBJECTIVE way to define virtue as one person&#39;s virtue leaves others feeling flat. <a href="" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Carlossuarez46">talk</a>) 21:00, 13 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>&#60;s&#62;:* <b>Oppose</b>&#60;/s&#62;. There are seven heavenly virtues in the Christian-centric world, throw in a couple more from other religions/philosophies and I think you really do have a category. Some of the articles open up &#34;XXX is a virtue...&#34;, (others don&#39;t and should be removed accordingly). Otherwise we might find ourselves in the same position as <a href="" title="gluttony">gluttony</a> (one of the seven deadly sins) only categorised as <a href="" title="Category:Food and drink appreciation">Category:Food and drink appreciation</a>. Now than made me laugh. So I say it&#39;s some of the contents that are wrong, not the category itself. --<a href="" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Richhoncho">talk</a>) 21:48, 13 April 2009 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>&#60;s&#62;<b>Keep</b>&#60;/s&#62;. Agree Richhoncho. Rename &#38; create subcats?: Christian virtues, Biblical virtues: seven is OK for a clear named cat. Remains: throw from the cat the <i>articles</i> that are subjective -<a href="" title="User:DePiep">DePiep</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DePiep">talk</a>) 22:35, 13 April 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>I change: <b>Merge</b> into parent <a href="" title="Category:Virtue">Cat:Virtue</a>, then delete the cat. Discovered: there is the Cat:Virtue and there is this CfD subcat <a href="" title="Category:Virtues">Cat:Virtue<i>s</i></a>. First on names: by the <a href="" title="WP:NCCAT">Naming convention (cat)</a> a catname on a <i>topic</i> is singular, and can contain all articles that are <i>a</i> virtue, <i>multiple</i> virtues (like Seven), and <i>about</i> the topic virtue. So this is the one we keep for sure. (In there are/can be also the &#39;no-gluttony-effect&#39; virtues Richhoncho mentiones). Second: is the CfD&#39;ed cat:Virtues needed? Not by its name, nor intruduction, nor current content. Now I conclude: lets eliminate the CfD-cat Virtues indeed. But how? What to do with the content? Thre: first line of thought: all articles and subsubcats move from Virtues to Virtue, by a bot (then delete cat:Vitue<i>s</i>). Then, in a second, separate sweep, we could throw out articles &#38; subcats that are there by some <a href="#Subjective_inclusion" title="WP:OC">WP:OC</a>: general consent or &#39;commonly and widely regarded as&#39; virtue. One by one. What stays are Virtue (article), Seven Virtues, the Cardinal Virtues etc: virtues that are verifyably named as a virtue by their organisation. In a third sweep, or right now, we could check possible overlapping categories like <a href="" title="Category:Morality">Category:Morality</a> and <a href="" title="Category:Personality traits">Category:Personality traits</a> (I&#39;d say no, but can be underinfomed). -<a href="" title="User:DePiep">DePiep</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DePiep">talk</a>) 08:56, 14 April 2009 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Delete</b> - If there were some apparent way to restrict this to prevent NPOV plunking of everything any particular editor found to be virtuous into it, I&#39;d say <i>keep and restrict</i>. However, there does not seem to be any such logical boundary. Whatever else happens, <i>do not merge</i> to <a href="" title="Category:Virtue">Category:Virtue</a>, which has pretty well been restricted to articles about the concept or history of virtue and not a plunked-together list of virtues. I shudder at the notion of swamping the two dozen or so articles currently in the parent with over a hundred articles from the subcat. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 21:49, 14 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Good point. After counting (not reading) and at first glance: near zero articles would have to promote to Virtue. Almost. Lets check: cat:<a href="" title="Virtue ethics">Virtue ethics</a>- already there, <a href="" title="category:Ancient Roman virtues">category:Ancient Roman virtues</a>: Keep=promote! Candidate articles for staying (up at cat:Virtue): <a href="" title="Charity (virtue)">Charity (virtue)</a> and <a href="" title="Hope (virtue)">Hope (virtue)</a>.

<dd>Interesting. I&#39;ll write my thoughts here. On the &#34;part of a series&#34;: I understand the series you mean is like <a href="" title="Category:Estuaries">&#34;Estuaries of (country) XXX&#34;</a>, so with only one in the cat, it would (should) still show up in <a href="" title="Category:Estuaries">Category:Estuaries</a>. Do we need a new cat called &#34;Estuaries by country&#34; then? But without that one, what do we miss when the now-subsubcat is listed in <a href="" title="Category:Estuaries">Category:Estuaries</a> as a cat with a different name (not mentioning the country), instead? I think this is not what the cat-structure is set up for (now getting intuitive). Aside, it could be OK, but this would overrule the OVERCAT#SMALL-argument. Elsewhere: if the cat is needed in a navbox or so, the article can always be piped into the country-name. On &#34;(...) included belongs&#34;: I do not understand, mistype or too subtle English for me. On &#34;some of the articles might be correctly included&#34;: indeed I think a lot of articles there should be out of this <a href="" title="Category:Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta">Category:Rhine-Meuse-Scheldt delta</a>. This does not change the CfD subject here. -<a href="" title="User:DePiep">DePiep</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DePiep">talk</a>) 19:21, 19 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Keep in some (most) cases</b> I&#39;m (boldly) overturning these speedy deletion nominations. I understand the argument but I find it weak and certainly not strong enough to justify speedy deletion. The fact that the categories contain a single song is of course irrelevant per many many precedents. As far as having no parent article, this is usually a sign that the article should be created. Articles about non-notable songs are weeded out with a vengeance so at the very least all the people above are either authors or performers of notable songs. That may not always be the case but they have to be evaluated individually. <a href="" title="User:Pascal.Tesson">Pascal.Tesson</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Pascal.Tesson">talk</a>) 22:07, 14 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>I agree that it is not G8; and that a sole author of a notable song has at least some claim to notability, rather stronger than in the case of producers cited above. <a href="" title="User:Occuli">Occuli</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Occuli">talk</a>) 18:33, 15 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<li><b>Comment</b> Category:Songs by songwriter is a backwater that I don&#39;t think anybody has looked at seriously at all. Until I created them, there was no relevant categories for Lennon/McCartney, Jagger/Richards, Cathy Dennis (at least 19 songs listed at WP and no category) and about 50 others. Numerous sub-categories need to be renamed to be brought into line. If I can find enough information to create an article I have done this to save the category, about 3 or 4 times so far, including Helsy Krema, as noted above. However, what is left above are categories with only one entry, and I wouldn&#39;t think a category with one entry is a category in the first place! Secondly, at the moment there is no supporting article and by virtue of the fact I haven&#39;t been able to find enough basic information via Google an article is unlikely to be forthcoming. It&#39;s not that I &#34;want&#34; these categories to be deleted, but that I can&#39;t &#34;find&#34; enough details to keep them alive. Easy enough to recreate if there is enough information, but at the moment they merely clutter, serve no useful purpose and, as far as I can see, have opportunity to expand. --<a href="" title="User:Richhoncho">Richhoncho</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Richhoncho">talk</a>) 12:55, 15 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul><hr/>

<li><b>Keep</b> When I created the cat I was not aware of the previous existence of the cats mentioned by the nominator. However, this cat is different, as there are no BLP concerns. It is a major and defining aspect of every person in it, as well as for several others that should be added to the cat. The orientation of each of those in the cat are much debated, by historians as well as the public, years after the subject&#39;s deaths. The articles concerned have a great deal of info in their articles and talk pages about the fact their orientation is debated. That a US President and a British Prime Minister were probably LGBT are major milestone events. That the person whom is regarded by a large proportion of the population as the world&#39;s greatest writer ever was probably bisexual is very notable. LGBT organisations often state as fact that some of the people in the cat were LGBT. An article about the subject could reasonably be written. In the case of Lincoln and Shakespeare, Sexuality of ... articles already exist, proving it is very notable in their cases. Only those people whose sexual orientation was very relevant to their lives and place in history are in the cat. In the cases of each of those in the cat, it is far from trivial, and is not merely the case that someone at some time asked what orientation they were; all of them are of massively, not only occasionally, debated orientation. It is culturally relevant to LGBT and history, and also to modern popular culture: Lincoln&#39;s orientation was used prominently in the video to Electric Six&#39;s song <a href="" title="Gay Bar (song)">Gay Bar</a>. <a href="" title="User:Nietzsche 2">Nietzsche 2</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nietzsche 2">talk</a>) 00:32, 14 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li><b>Delete</b> - inherently POV category. While there may not, strictly speaking, be BLP issues with this category, it&#39;s far too easy to add it someone&#39;s article to make insinuations about them. Moreover, pretty much <i>every</i> major historical figure has been alleged by someone to be gay at some point, so this isn&#39;t really a defining characteristic. <a href="" title="User:Robofish">Robofish</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Robofish">talk</a>) 04:32, 14 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li><b>Comment </b> No BLP issues - all subjects are definitely dead; none of the articles in question suggest any homosexual relationships with any living people. Though many people have at some point had their sexuality questioned by someone, this category is only for those whose sexual orientation is a subject of much debate, by experts / historians / media. I have read and understood the guidelines; this cat meets them. The category name is neutral and in each article in thae cat their orientation and the fact it is debated is a relevant part of their life and place in history. It <i>is</i> a defining charactersitic of <a href="" title="Edward Heath">Edward Heath</a> that he was likely the only LGBT British PM; that he never came out of the closet; that he used <a href="" title="beard (companion)">beards</a>; that if his true orientation had been known to the public he would never have become PM, perhaps never have even become an MP. As for the early part of his political career homosexual acts were criminal offences, he could have been prosecuted, even imprisoned. If any particular article is inadequately referenced for inclusion in the category, then more refs can be found. An article about the subject could be written, I could probably write the bare bones of it myself, and I&#39;m no expert. The article could be called something along the lines of &#39;Closeted and probable LGBT people in positions of power and influence in history&#39; and would begin by stating that there were many such people, including politicians, musicians, writers, etc that for various reasons never admitted their true orientation, and in many cases chose to deny it, and cover it up through the the use of <a href="" title="beard (companion)">beards</a> and marriages of convenience. It would go through the reasons, including reduced public popularity, prosecution etc, and give examples. The fact that articles on the sexuality of two long-dead US Presidents, along with Shakespeare already exist means that internal links to those articles could be in the new article. Many people of much-disputed sexual orientation are, despite having died decades ago, still very relevant and influential to today&#39;s culture and life. Marc Bolan and John Lennon, each of whom&#39;s orientation (were they straight or bi?) is still dicussed. Their music is still played frequently and they were each a major part of 20th century history. <a href="" title="User:Nietzsche 2">Nietzsche 2</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nietzsche 2">talk</a>) 14:42, 14 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Delete</b> - while I sharply disagree with the notion that calling someone gay is an &#34;ugly rumor&#34; and while I am sympathetic to the aims of the category&#39;s creator, that someone&#39;s sexuality is the topic of discussion after their death does not rise to the level of definingness for the person. Historical research is loaded with this sort of unanswerable question and trying to deal with them through categorizing the individuals is untenable and will lead to any number of other similar categories cluttering up biography articles. We do have <a href="" title="Category:Sexuality of individuals">Category:Sexuality of individuals</a> which I think serves the intended purpose of this category and is restricted to articles about sexuality and not full biography articles.

<li>This fails <a href="" title="WP:CATGRS">WP:CATGRS</a> (&#34;Categories should not be gendered unless the gender has a specific relation to the topic&#34;), as arbitrary, pointless gendering of a category. There is nothing rare or special about female players, and women&#39;s pool is not different in any notable, encyclopedic way from men&#39;s, nor discriminated against in modern times.  Women do not play the game in any known way, mentally or physically, differently than men, nor are the game rules or equipment at all different (which is not the case with, for example, <a href="" title="women&#39;s basketball">women&#39;s basketball</a>). Their roles and their opportunities for leadership are not different (which is not the case with, for example, <a href="" title="Category:Women in the Canadian armed services">Category:Women in the Canadian armed services</a>. This is categorization by genitals, pure and simple.</li>
<li>It fails <a href="" title="WP:OVERCAT">WP:OVERCAT</a> (&#34;Avoid intersections of two traits that are unrelated, even if some person can be found that has both traits&#34;, etc.), as a trivial intersection.  There is nothing notable, or deeply related, or unusual about &#34;pool player&#34; and &#34;female&#34; being juxtaposed (contrast <a href="" title="Category:Female astronauts">Category:Female astronauts</a>). It is basically exactly the same idea as <a href="" title="Category:Female doctors">Category:Female doctors</a>.</li>
<li>The articles are already sorted by nationality, so no merge is necessary (the category can simply be deleted and removed from 13 articles, and there is no huge pile of unsorted pool player articles, or anything like that.</li>
<li>The category is a structural orphan. There is no parent <a href="" title="Category:Female cue sports players">Category:Female cue sports players</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b>.  Not having gone through the previous CfDs (so perhaps weight my thoughts accordingly), this nomination makes no sense to me.  Female pool players have their own division of the <a href="" title="World Pool-Billiard Association">WPA</a> and compete separately in their own events.  The fact that their equipment is the same as men whereas women&#39;s basketball players use a slightly smaller basketball than men is an irrelevant distinction IMO and should have no bearing on how the respective athletes are categorized.

<dd>I think editors should lay off SMcCandlish. The fact that the previous two discussions were closed as &#34;no consensus&#34; is a good reason to have another discussion. Had they been closed as &#34;keep&#34;, the complainers  might have a case of the nominator pushing the issue too far, but a &#34;no consensus&#34; results pretty much cries out for a new discussion, which is all the nominator has done.

<li>The point isn&#39;t that they <i>don&#39;t</i> play differently, it&#39;s that they <i>do</i> compete separately.  The fact that the rules are the same is irrelevant, what matters is that they compete for different championships, in different leagues, and only against each other.  Take for example <a href="" title="Category:Female divers">Category:Female divers</a> or <a href="" title="Category:Female golfers">Category:Female golfers</a>.  In both cases, females are categorized separately because they compete separately.  Would you lobby for the deletion of these as well?  The fact that the rules of some women&#39;s games are different than men&#39;s games is irrelevant.  It&#39;s the fact that they compete in their own leagues that merits separate categorization. <a href="" title="User:Oren0">Oren0</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Oren0">talk</a>) 05:27, 14 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Again, they <i>sometimes</i> compete separately, but other times do <i>not</i>, which is true of virtually every competitive activity on earth, yet they are not all gender divided in category-space. And in this realm they do not compete in different leagues at all.  I think you are thinking of the WPBA (f) and the USPPA (m). These are not different leagues. They are different pro tours (and different corporate entities for internecine political reasons), but for competitive purposes they are the f and m professional franchisees of the BCA, and both of them feed into the US Open, the premier US-hosted pro pool event. Even pushing that aside, that is only an isolated US phenomenon. This is not us.en.wiki. WPA has no leagues at all. Actual <i>leagues</i> are not (so far as I have ever been able to determine after years of working on cue sports articles) gender-divided, from the APA to the VNA to the BCA/BCAPL, and including minor leagues like ACA, TAP, SFTPA, and others. I cannot speak for Carlossuarez46, but I would not &#34;lobby&#34; (<a href="" title="WP:CIVIL">loaded term</a>!) for deletion of either of the two categories you mention, because they are <i>qualitatively different</i> from the one at hand. PS: The fact that in some sports the game rules are (i.e. the <i>game itself</i> is) different is not irrelevant at all, but one of the main ways by which sports categories <i>do</i> get gender-split.  That it does not apply here in any way at all is actually quite significant. There are <i>precisely zero</i> differences in rules, equipment, shot types, style of play, techniques, instruction and training, venues, etc., etc., etc. PPS: Another way of putting it: One of my area&#39;s local top-dog players also happens to be Anna Kostanian (who should have an article here by now), the #10 WPBA player and a professional road player. If you came up and told her there was some fundamental, defining difference between women&#39;s and men&#39;s pool, she would probably kick your [insert favorite term for backside here], and the entire pool hall, m &#38; f alike, would cheer her on. I strongly suspect that you do not even realize that you have wandered inadvertently into a pool-world sore spot and are picking at its scab, in a way that random people may not notice but which actual members of the pocket billiards community find really, really annoying and outmoded. See <a href="" title="Jean Balukas">Jean Balukas</a> for a hint as to how long this m/f divide idea has <i>publicly</i> been obnoxious; it was incensing to many for generations before she stood up to it. — &#60;b&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Tahoma;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/b&#62; &#38;#91;<a href="" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>&#38;#93; &#38;#91;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">cont</a>&#38;#93;  &#60;b&#62;‹(-¿-)›&#60;/b&#62; 08:24, 14 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>&#34;Again, they <i>sometimes</i> compete separately, but other times do <i>not</i>, which is true of virtually every competitive activity on earth&#34; &#38;ndash; I know of no other professional sport or game that works this way for serious competition except for poker, which is entirely gender mixed except for one ladies event a year, and tennis (mixed doubles). I&#39;m far from an expert on the subject, but what I do know is that the WPA, the &#34;international governing body for pocket billiards&#34; according to its article, has separate divisions and championships for men and for women. The events I&#39;ve seen on TV, no matter what type of pool they are, have always been either a men&#39;s championship or a women&#39;s one. That&#39;s competing separately on the largest and most important stages, correct? The fact that in random games men can play against women doesn&#39;t change the fact that, according to the governing body on the subject, they compete separately in professional events. Maybe the real solution here is to do what soccer does: see <a href="" title="Category:Soccer players in the United States by competition">Category:Soccer players in the United States by competition</a>. The women have their own subcategory (<a href="" title="Category:Women&#39;s United Soccer Association players">Category:Women&#39;s United Soccer Association players</a>) by virtue of having their own league. Women who compete in the Female division of the WPA can similarly have their own category, which I&#39;m guessing would be functionally equivalent to this one. <a href="" title="User:Oren0">Oren0</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Oren0">talk</a>) 17:45, 14 April 2009 (UTC) </li></ul>

<li><a href="" title="WP:IDONTKNOWIT">WP:IDONTKNOWIT</a> is not a valid XfD argument.  Various televised events include m vs. f play, including Trick Shot Challenge and the World Speed Pool Championship, both of which are popular and frequently televised events, and both of which often feature female pros (<a href="" title="Jeanette Lee (pool player)">Jeanette Lee</a> in particular comes to mind as a finalist in both events last year).  This is a <a href="" title="red herring">red herring</a> anyway. The WPA does have separate divisions, sure. As an <a href="" title="International Olympic Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> branch it is bound to, because the Olympics are highly gendered. This does not mean much of anything in the real world. Zero cue sports (pool, snooker, and other billiards disciplines) are even demo sports at the Olympic level. They&#39;ve been blockaded for decades. The industry has largely given up on that cause, at least for the short term. The WPA events are significant in a symbolic sense, but no they are not the &#34;largest and most important stages&#34;, which are the big-money tournaments like the US Open (with which the USPPA and WPA have different contracts) and the Derby City Classic (which is simply wide open). Despite being US-hosted, they are fully international. — &#60;b&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Tahoma;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:SMcCandlish">SMcCandlish</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/b&#62; &#38;#91;<a href="" title="User talk:SMcCandlish">talk</a>&#38;#93; &#38;#91;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/SMcCandlish">cont</a>&#38;#93;  &#60;b&#62;‹(-¿-)›&#60;/b&#62; 04:55, 15 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Let me revise my statement, &#34;If the genders are separated in competition <b>in notable contexts</b>, then it is appropriate for our coverage to reflect that.
