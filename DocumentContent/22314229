<ul>
<li>  - The article is in such poor shape for a number of reason (poor sourcing, weight, BLP violations) that I am proposing a complete rewrite <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michele_Bachmann#Article_Rewrite" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michele_Bachmann#Article_Rewrite"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michele_Bachmann#Article_Rewrite" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michele_Bachmann#Article_Rewrite">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Michele_Bachmann#Article_Rewrite</a></a>. <a href="" title="User:CENSEI">CENSEI</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:CENSEI">talk</a>) 00:25, 28 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>The article has a lot of fat that needs trimming, but I don&#39;t see any serious BLP issues. The one issue that CENSEI has brought up on the talk page was about a paragraph that was sourced to a blog of a political reporter for a well-respected local newspaper. CENSEI argues that it was not a reliable source and should be removed. Others on the talk page disagreed, as do I. Other issues that have been raised include the fact that 1/3 of the references cannot be verified. But this is untrue. A lot cannot be verified by clicking on a link, but that is not a condition of <a href="" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>. These are sources from local newspapers covering the politician. </dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>I&#39;ve removed the 3 specific instances of information cited to unreliable sources.<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michele_Bachmann&#38;diff=280244693&#38;oldid=280208744" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michele_Bachmann&#38;diff=280244693&#38;oldid=280208744"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michele_Bachmann&#38;diff=280244693&#38;oldid=280208744" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michele_Bachmann&#38;diff=280244693&#38;oldid=280208744">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Michele_Bachmann&#38;diff=280244693&#38;oldid=280208744</a></a> The only other issue that I see raised is that undue weight is placed on particular aspects of the congresswoman&#39;s voting record, with the only specific issue being raised about the 100 hour plan. Congresspeople are only notable for what they do in Congress. It seems noteworthy to note their political opinions and votes. Based on the other sub-sections in the 110th congress, I do not think it is undue weight to talk about the 100 hour plan, as it received major media coverage. If there are other issues that need to be discussed in that section, they should be added instead of information being removed. -<a href="" title="User:Atmoz">Atmoz</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Atmoz">talk</a>) 17:27, 28 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>I don’t think that you are entirely correct that only one issue was brought up. The example on talk was only one example of a much larger symptomatic problem. Is, to bring up another specific, The <a href="" title="Indymedia">Center for Independent Media</a> a reliable source? Three entire sections in the article are based off of it. I would ask you to look more carefully at the article again.  </dd>
<dd>While you claimed that the material on the 100 hour plan recieved major media coverage, all citations were made to the Mankato Free Press, and to an opinion piece at that, not even a news story.  <a href="" title="User:CENSEI">CENSEI</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:CENSEI">talk</a>) 00:59, 31 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>There need to be more eyes watching this article, which is the BLP of a Turkish academic teaching at Clark University.

<p>The question of overcategorization, as it applies to the subject of a BLP, is joined, both in recent reversions and re-reversions at the subject&#39;s page.  Would others with an interest in whether or not the &#34;American Criminal&#34; category is overcategorization where the &#34;Politicians who have been convicted of crimes&#34; categorization is undisputed please chime in on the talk page and with edits, if appropriate?  I have in mind <a href="" title="WP:UNDUEWEIGHT">WP:UNDUEWEIGHT</a>.  What do others think? <a href="" title="User:David in DC">David in DC</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David in DC">talk</a>) 19:52, 30 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>If we had a category for &#34;American politicians convicted of crimes&#34; then it would cover both the career and the nationality. A comparable category would be <a href="" title="Category:Convicted Italian MPs">Category:Convicted Italian MPs</a>. However we don&#39;t have such a category at present and so two separate categories are needed to properly categorize this subject. That isn&#39;t &#34;overcategorization&#34;. Since there is no doubt that the subject is American, a politican, and a convicted criminal I don&#39;t think that there is any BLP issue here.   &#38;nbsp; &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:Will Beback">&#60;font color=&#34;#595454&#34;&#62;Will Beback&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; <a href="" title="User talk:Will Beback">&#60;font color=&#34;#C0C0C0&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; &#60;/b&#62; 20:18, 30 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I&#39;m hard-pressed to understand why &#34;Politicians convicted of crimes&#34; and &#34;Political scandals in the United States&#34; don&#39;t cover all of these attributes sufficiently. <a href="" title="User:David in DC">David in DC</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David in DC">talk</a>) 20:24, 30 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Because scandals and crimes aren&#39;t the same thing. Many scandals don&#39;t involve crimes, and not all crimes create scandals. In any case, that&#39;s an issue to resolve by creating or reorganizing the categories as a whole, not by deleting valid categories from an individual article.  &#38;nbsp; &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:Will Beback">&#60;font color=&#34;#595454&#34;&#62;Will Beback&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; <a href="" title="User talk:Will Beback">&#60;font color=&#34;#C0C0C0&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; &#60;/b&#62; 20:29, 30 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>A bigger issue is the definition of the category itself: membership of <a href="" title="Category:American criminals">Category:American criminals</a> is given by being convicted of a &#34;notable felony&#34; (plus some non-convicted where guilt is undisputed). I don&#39;t know where/how &#34;notable felony&#34; is defined... Anyway this category is part of <a href="" title="Category:American people by occupation">Category:American people by occupation</a>. This seems to elide technically being a criminal (i.e convicted of a felony crime) with being a criminal by occupation, a huge leap. Even if the category weren&#39;t placed within the &#34;occupation&#34; category, this same leap occurs with applying <a href="" title="Category:American criminals">Category:American criminals</a> directly to BLPs of people who don&#39;t earn the majority of their living through crime (that being the common usage of &#34;criminal&#34; IMO). This leap between technical definition and common usage is problematic to the point of being a <a href="" title="WP:NPOV">WP:NPOV</a> problem. <a href="" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:rd232">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 20:46, 30 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>RD, this matter received extensive discussion previously, particularly at <a href="#Yikes.21" title="Category talk:American criminals">Category talk:American criminals</a>. &#38;nbsp; &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:Will Beback">&#60;font color=&#34;#595454&#34;&#62;Will Beback&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; <a href="" title="User talk:Will Beback">&#60;font color=&#34;#C0C0C0&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; &#60;/b&#62; 21:09, 30 March 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>RD, there are many people who are notable for their crimes, but who have earned little or any money from them. For example, would we omit Charles Manson from the category because he didn&#39;t make a living as a criminal? That doesn&#39;t seem to make sense to me. There are many major crimes that don&#39;t generate any income. &#38;nbsp; &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:Will Beback">&#60;font color=&#34;#595454&#34;&#62;Will Beback&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; <a href="" title="User talk:Will Beback">&#60;font color=&#34;#C0C0C0&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; &#60;/b&#62; 21:17, 30 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Don&#39;t know where you are, but here in western Pennsylvania this was well-known, and indeed part of a notable controversy: see <a href="" title="2006 Pennsylvania General Assembly bonus controversy">Bonusgate</a>.  It&#39;s my opinion that he&#39;s a criminal by dint of having pled guilty to a crime: what is a criminal if not this?  <a href="" title="Oxford English Dictionary">Oxford</a> defines the noun &#34;criminal&#34; as &#34;A person accused of a crime&#34; (obsolete; this would be POV anyway) or &#34;A person guilty or convicted of a crime.&#34;  Perhaps this is a problem with the category itself; but the idea of this man being an American criminal is surely not a problem.  <a href="" title="User:Nyttend">Nyttend</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nyttend">talk</a>) 20:51, 30 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>That sounds like it solves the problem that started this thread. But there&#39;s still my definitional problem with the American Criminals category. But I guess I should take the issue to the talk page of that category, and I can&#39;t be bothered. Can&#39;t care about everything, and like so many of these huge categories, they don&#39;t seem to serve much purpose anyway beyond generating argument; labelling for the sake of labelling. So I&#39;ll let it be rather than argue about the labels. <a href="" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:rd232">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 14:11, 31 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Actually, it doesn&#39;t even solve that.  I tried creating the cat and implementing it on two pages, but was quickly reverted.  Good Olfactory rightly pointed out that this category, for better or worse, has already been created and deleted as a result of a CfD consensus.  It&#39;s back to the drawing board.  I suggest all furth conversation on this topic move over to the American Criminal Category talk page. <a href="" title="User:David in DC">David in DC</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David in DC">talk</a>) 02:26, 1 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Propaganda_Due_list_of_members"><a href="" title="Propaganda Due">Propaganda Due</a> list of members</span></h2>

<p><a href="" title="Propaganda Due">Propaganda Due</a> (P2) was a quasi-Masonic Lodge that was at the heart of a huge financial scandal in Italy, back in the 1980s... Both the group and the scandal were real, but both has subsequently become fodder for various conspiracy theorists.  </p>
<p>The article contains a section on &#34;notable members&#34; of P2, and I have serious concerns about whether such a section passes WP:BLP.  The core issue here is that the article lists people (some living, some dead) as being members of P2 based on what are essentially rumors reported in the tabloid press, at various conspiracy theory websites, and other unreliable (or at best semi-reliable) sources.  <i>Some</i> (but hardly all) of these sources say that they got <i>their</i> information from an offical report created by the Italian government. That report apparently contains an appendix that  lists the names of people found on a rolodex owned by the groops leader. The assumption that the unreliable sources make is that the names on this rolodex were all members of the Lodge (an assumption that is questioned in reliable sources and which is actually warned against in the previous section of our article).

<dd>This description of the issue at hand is full of false allegations and misrepresentations of the facts. The list is real and can be found on what I consider a reliable web site. There are other websites that carry the list and the names are consistent. On top of that, the people named in the list in the article all have a second reference.

I am asking those who are familiar with the BLP policy to come to the artcile and look at it.  There is no requirement that anyone be notified (and given that you found my post within half an hour of my posting it, there was no <i>need</i> to notify you).

<p>Given that membership in organization was, on its own, illegal... And that there is no way of knowing for sure which of the supposed members actually joined, which were included on the membership list without their knowledge, and which were simply in the Rolodex of Gelli... I&#39;d say that the names themselves, but not necessarily the description of the list and its publication, should be removed. They don&#39;t seem to lend much crucial information to the article, and we ought to err on the side of not inaccurately describing &#34;notable&#34; people as having committed a crime. <a href="" title="User:Avruch">&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;Avruch&#60;/strong&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Avruch">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;  T  &#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 21:34, 31 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The membership of Berlusconi, Calvi, Sindona, high ranking military, not crucial? You must be joking. The membership of the people is common knowledge among anyone who has read a bit about P2. Removing them is making Wikipedia look very, very silly. All names are backed up by other reliable sources and I can add a dozen more if that is required.

<dd>I didn&#39;t suggest removing any of the names from the body of the article, merely the list. The confirmed members whose membership is described, with confirmation as opposed to presented as a possibility, should of course remain. But since most of the list consists of redlinked names, I think those people and others whose membership is not established in fact should be pared from the list. Removing the list is, really, a simpler alternative - its better to have their role described in prose in any case. And no, I&#39;m not joking. <a href="" title="User:Avruch">&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;Avruch&#60;/strong&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Avruch">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;  T  &#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 22:41, 31 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Avruch, what would you say constitutes confirmation of membership?  The problem we are having is two fold... a) Verifying that a given name was in fact on Gelli&#39;s list, and b) Verifying that being on this list indicates membership.  A lot of sources (some reliable, some semi-reliable, and many unreliable) state that a given person was on the list, but most if not all make the assumption that this means they were members.  I would certainly agree to listing those who have admitted membership, but how do we deal with those who are <i>assumed to be</i> members because they were on the list. <a href="" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Blueboar">talk</a>) 12:35, 1 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>I am afraid it is somewhat more complicated than Mr. Blueboar is presenting the issue. What about &#39;alleged&#39; members who denied their membership but were considered to be members by the Italian Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry or who were convicted by Italian courts? Since the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry considered the list reliable and genuine, all should be included, although we only highlight the most notable members in the list on Wikipedia. - <a href="" title="User:Mafia Expert">Mafia Expert</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mafia Expert">talk</a>) 15:05, 1 April 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I have proposed a compromise position. I have moved the final paragraph (which discusses how being on Gelli&#39;s list does not necessarily equate to membership) to the front of the section, and changed the section headers to avoid definitively stating that the list is a list of members... I think we <i>can</i> discuss the fact that the list was found, and note who was on it, as long as we don&#39;t state definitively that the list = membership.  Hopefully this will be acceptable. <a href="" title="User:Blueboar">Blueboar</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Blueboar">talk</a>) 15:16, 1 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>

<dd>There&#39;s a good reason why the policy on sources is there. New York Times is a reliable source in spite of their gaffe because they paid a a hefty price for their mistake, whereas Us Weekly is purely a tabloid that publishes false and exaggerated stories for readers&#39; enjoyment, and is not meant to be taken seriously. As far as I know, they have no plans on becoming a reputable news source. But I can&#39;t force you to believe it if you don&#39;t want to, so edit at your own discretion.

<p>I&#39;ve been watchlisting this article for some time due to persistent BLP problems. It concerns a veteran French journalist who has been the target of a fairly virulent online campaign for several years (he is effectively a hate figure in some quarters). He has been accused of various misdeeds by his detractors; the allegations against him are currently the subject of litigation in France and were judged defamatory by a French court in 2006. Unfortunately there have been persistent attempts to use his Wikipedia article to rehash these allegations and present them as fact or otherwise to discredit or impeach him, which raises obvious BLP and potential legal issues for us. I&#39;ve started a discussion about a rash of recent edits at <a href="#Describing_defamatory_claims_and_who_makes_them" title="Talk:Charles Enderlin">Talk:Charles Enderlin</a>.

<dd>Chris, you&#39;re using BLP as a figleaf here to violate 3rr. There are no &#34;defamatory&#34; claims here. Is it kind of a close call? Nope, not even remotely.

That violates no policy whatever, though trying to suppress it certainly does. And I have no idea why you&#39;re using that court case.

Again, as noted above, cutting down the relevant content in the Enderlin article to a summary of <a href="" title="Muhammad al-Durrah">Muhammad al-Durrah</a> would help, as this same argument there (where the material is duplicated in much greater detail) would be less contentious than in this bio.

<dd>You wrote &#34;Chris, you&#39;re using BLP as a figleaf here to violate 3rr.&#34;, and I neither know how experienced you are nor see how it&#39;s relevant. Either AGF or provide some evidence - don&#39;t insinuate. Also to suggest that referring to AGF is in itself a violation of it per se is nonsensical; the whole point of AGF is not to assume that you know another editor is acting in bad faith. References to AGF may be given in bad faith, it is true; but, as with AGF more generally, editors should avoid carping and insinuation, or make a substantial argument and provide evidence. As to the article, since neither side of the debate has provided diffs and the situation appears fluid it&#39;s hard to get much of a grip on it - which is why I only said what I said above, without commenting on specifics. <a href="" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:rd232">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 18:57, 29 March 2009 (UTC)

<p> &#60;br&#62;
 </p>
<p>Hello,
&#60;br/&#62;I&#39;m somewhat concerned about the treatment of a certain police officer in the <a href="" title="Ryan Moats">Ryan Moats</a> and <a href="" title="Zach Thomas">Zach Thomas</a> articles.
&#60;br/&#62;For those not familiar with the event, the cop basically robbed Moats of his last chance to see a relative before they died. <i>However</i>, as horrible as that is, it was still within the context of doing his job (however poorly he may have been doing it).
&#60;br/&#62;Since then, the only times his name has been mentioned publicly has been in the context of this event (whether directly or indirectly).
&#60;br/&#62;The mention in Thomas&#39;s article is even more disturbing, as it is only because of a single article that mentioned Thomas&#39;s <i>wife</i>, and was still within the context of the issue with Moats.
&#60;br/&#62;Keeping this in mind (and I&#39;ve also tried to explain part of my arguments on the Ryan Moats talk page, so by all means, get a better explanation there), I don&#39;t see how the officer&#39;s name can be used within the articles. Well, actually, I don&#39;t understand how the incident is relevant to Thomas&#39;s article at all, since the event didn&#39;t even involve Thomas. But my <i>primary</i> concern is with the mention of his name, since that seems to be a significant BLP concern.
&#60;br/&#62;As explained in the <a href="#Privacy_of_names" title="WP:BLP">policy page</a>, names of people who aren&#39;t public figures, relating primarily to a single event, should be omitted if it doesn&#39;t <i>significantly</i> detract from the article.
&#60;br/&#62;Anyways, I would appreciate if a few of you could look at that sectino of the policy page again (the &#39;privacy of names&#39; section), look at my arguments on the Moats talk page, and then perhaps weigh in? Both in terms of the Moats article and the Thomas article. <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/209.90.135.248">209.90.135.248</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:209.90.135.248">talk</a>) 00:42, 4 April 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;ve looked into it and have removed some of the information on the Ryan Moats page, and have deleted the entire reference to the incident on the Zach Thomas page. In concerns to the Ryan Moats page, I removed the text: &#34;including pulling a gun on Moats, even after Moats&#39;s explanation was corroborated by a hospital nurse&#34;. This is a completely libelous statement. &#34;Pulling a gun on Moats&#34; infers to the reader that the officer was not acting in official capacity and simply pulled a gun on him. It was also unsourced, but I believe should be left out even if a source is found. I removed the &#34;Moats questioned whether race could have played a factor in the interaction due to the nature and tone of the officer&#39;s remarks to the family&#34; statement for obvious reasons, and I removed the jailing for an illegal u-turn section because it has no bearing on this incident whatsoever. I removed the entire section regarding the handcuffing and jailing &#34;incident&#34; on the Zach Thomas article. I can&#39;t think of a reason why it was included or considered notable in the first place.

<dd>Just so everytone will know there was a discussion ongoing on the talk page there, which has now come to this page. Actually Matty, the issue the IP was bringing up was the naming of the officer in the article. I can see your point on the &#34;pulling his gun&#34; section, however, the questioning by Moats of a possible racial motivation is properly sourced and relevant. It&#39;s been added by multiple editors (when an anon IP was blanking it), so I don&#39;t understand what your &#34;obvious reasons&#34; for deleting the sentence are. <a href="" title="User:Dayewalker">Dayewalker</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dayewalker">talk</a>) 01:28, 4 April 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Though the &#39;race&#39; accusation was, of course, laughable, I do agree that it&#39;s still Moat&#39;s opinion, and thus relevant to the Moats article. The &#39;pulled a gun&#39; comment is, indeed, an additional concern, as it has a very accusatory tone. But my primary concern was with the inclusion of his name.</dd>
<dd>I must say, however, that I find it slightly offensive that anyone is being accused of &#39;misusing&#39; WP:BLP. Please assume good faith, particularly when it&#39;s simply about adhering to a supposedly important policy.</dd>
<dd>I&#39;d also like to remind Grsz11 that whether or not something is &#39;sourced&#39; is not always the only concern. If it was, then WP:BLP wouldn&#39;t even exist. <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/209.90.135.248">209.90.135.248</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:209.90.135.248">talk</a>) 01:39, 4 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<dd>Agree with threeafterthree - massive <a href="" title="WP:UNDUE">WP:UNDUE</a> issues. Also I see no reason why the police officer in question should be identified by name. The relevance of the incident in that article is from Moats&#39; interaction with a police officer. Anonymising the police officer would help focus on the issue at hand and lessen the BLP issues re the man who was just doing his job. Moats was a visitor delayed for 13 minutes - there&#39;s a lot of bad luck that that time was critical for the person he was visiting, but I&#39;m somewhat skeptical about the encyclopedic value of the whole thing. <a href="#NEWS" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>. As to the Thomas&#39; wife thing in the other article: absolutely out, no justification for inclusion at all. <a href="" title="User:Rd232">Rd232</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="user talk:rd232">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 12:12, 4 April 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Well, I&#39;ve now removed the officer&#39;s name. <i>Hopefully</i>, if anyone disagrees, they&#39;ll discuss it on the talk page before reverting. The article doesn&#39;t seem to have lost any readability or context from the removal. As for removing the entire incident, well, it <i>does</i> seem to give undue weight. On the other hand, it&#39;s very much conceivable that people may very well look up Ryan Moats&#39;s article for more information on this subject. Even if I think that content is a bit unnecessary, I still tend to prefer to give readers information they may be searching for.

<p>(outdent) Just to follow up, thanks for the input from others. I don&#39;t think, nor was I saying that we need to nuke the entire section. This &#34;incident&#34; was widely reported and is more than well sourced. Just rename the section title, reduce it in size, and leave out the commentary. The incident, which has been pointed out by others but not included in the article, actually reflects on how well this individual handled the situation and didn&#39;t allow it to escalate into something truely ugly. If that had been me, I would have kicked the cop in the nuts and been on my way, but I am a hot head :). I renamed the section for now and hopefully over time this &#34;material&#34; can be trimmed back and other relevant facts added to the bio to improve it.

<p>I&#39;m with Morbidthoughts on this one. We can reasonably assume that the real name of a porn star who acts under a pseudonym is information that requires both reliable sourcing and a sound argument for inclusion. IMBD and realname.of fail the first requirement, and no argument that the real name is relevant has been made. Keep in mind that the mere existence of information isn&#39;t enough to justify inclusion. <a href="" title="User:Avruch">&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;Avruch&#60;/strong&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Avruch">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;  T  &#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 16:39, 6 April 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>On January 23, 2009, CNN host Lou Dobbs characterized earlier remarks by Reich as implying &#34;that race would play a large role in determining who would benefit from the economic stimulus package&#34;,[12] airing video of Reich commenting on the package. In the video, Reich said that he was concerned &#34;...that these jobs not simply go to high school people who are already professionals or to white male construction workers. I have nothing against white male construction workers. I&#39;m just saying that there are a lot of other people who have needs as well.&#34;[12]</p>

<li>  - This article has many &#34;sourced&#34; nuggets about this man, and I don&#39;t think all of them pass the smell test. For example, I <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Mellon_Scaife&#38;diff=282493708&#38;oldid=282489433" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Richard_Mellon_Scaife&#38;diff=282493708&#38;oldid=282489433">removed</a> a segment about alcoholism in his family that was not supported by the alleged <a class="externallink" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifedough050299.htm" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/scaifedough050299.htm">source</a>.

<li>  - This article makes allegations of fraud.  The basis for the allegation is a decade-old newspaper article.  The dispute between contributors concerns whether this constitutes sufficient grounds for the allegation.  The defamatory nature of the allegations brings an urgency to the need to resolve the matter.  There is also an argument that the article should not be included at all because it is related to a single event - which may not have happened - and hence is non-notable. Given these two factors, it is suggested that the article be rapidly deleted. <a href="" title="User:Paul Tree">Paul Tree</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Paul Tree">talk</a>)</li></ul>

<p>Hello, I am contacting you on behalf of Ron Dembo at Zerofootprint. We are trying to update his Biography on Wikipedia as it is currently out of date.</p>
<p>This is the new Biography we are tying to post:</p><hr/>
<p>Dr. Ron Dembo is the Founder and CEO of <a class="externallink" href="http://zerofootprint.net" rel="nofollow" title="http://zerofootprint.net">Zerofootprint</a>, an organization dedicated to a mass reduction in global environmental impact.

<li>I&#39;ve added my opinion. Thanks for mentioning it here. This involves a section of the article entitled &#34;Urban Legend&#34; repeating a story that Gere had a gerbil lodged in his rectum! I&#39;d have removed it myself but then I saw that there was an extensive discussion on the talk page. I urge an administrator to step in and if necessary protect the page.  <a href="" title="User:Stetsonharry">Stetsonharry</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Stetsonharry">talk</a>) 20:05, 4 April 2009 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Good move. I&#39;d have done so myself but I hesitated when I saw the lengthy discussion. Next time, I delete on sight myself. Apparently this is a recurrent issue, and the page may require protection if it persists. <a href="" title="User:Stetsonharry">Stetsonharry</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Stetsonharry">talk</a>) 20:19, 4 April 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Every now and then, someone else tries adding that stupid legend. I&#39;d finally stopped watching the page, and sure enough it happened again. One of the biggest (if less obvious) problems is that, yes, false information <i>can</i> be acknowledged in articles. (eg. if someone&#39;s accused of a crime they didn&#39;t commit, etc) Of course, this assumes that the accusation is notable, well-sourced, and verifiably was made. Being false is beside the point, so long as Wikipedia doesn&#39;t imply that it&#39;s <i>true</i>.&#60;p&#62;However, in <i>this</i> case, there isn&#39;t even a <i>single</i> source referring to anyone actually <i>making</i> this accusation. In the absence of such a source, the <i>best</i> we&#39;re left with is sources of people <i>debunking</i> the legend. This means that: Wikipedia says that (for example) snopes says that <i>someone</i> asked them about a legend that <i>someone else</i> may or may not have believed was true. How many degrees of separation is that?!? <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/209.90.135.182">209.90.135.182</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:209.90.135.182">talk</a>) 20:22, 4 April 2009 (UTC)

<p>(outdent) I don&#39;t know how long this &#34;rumor&#34;/urban legend has been linked to Gere, but I know the same &#34;story&#34; was tied to a tv personallity in Philly during the early 80s. I swear that the &#34;story&#34; came across as &#34;true&#34; with hospital reports ect. I won&#39;t name the person obviously, they do have an article here, but most Philly folks around in the 80s will probably know who I am talking about.

<p>Five points:

<ul>
<li>We&#39;ve already discussed this.  See <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard/Archive15">Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard/Archive15</a> and <a href="#Deleting_references_to_the_gerbil_legend" title="Talk:Richard Gere/General Archive2">Talk:Richard Gere/General Archive2</a>.</li>
<li><i>From Abba to Zoom: A Pop Culture Encyclopedia of the Late 20th Century</i> (<a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780740751189" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/9780740751189">ISBN 9780740751189</a>) mentions that Gere is &#34;plagued by a rather nasty urban legend&#34; in its entry for &#34;Richard Gere&#34; on page 180.  Looking at the entry for &#34;ghosts&#34; on the very same page, it&#39;s clear that our editorial standards are a lot higher than Mansour&#39;s.  They should probably remain so.  And even Mansour, with his <i>low</i> standards, isn&#39;t specific on this matter.</li>
<li>One source observes that in the early 1970s this tale was told of some other Hollywood star.  I&#39;ve just checked xyr article.  I&#39;m happy to report that it contains not a mention of it, nor any indication on the talk page that editors are even aware of it.  Recentism, curse that it is, has operated in our favour for once.</li>
<li>We used to have an article on <a href="" title="gerbilling">gerbilling</a>.  We even had an AFD discussion of it at <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gerbilling">Wikipedia:Articles for deletion/Gerbilling</a>.  It was speedily deleted for being &#34;non-notable trivia&#34;, nonetheless.</li>
<li>There <i>are</i> sources that cover this urban legend, in depth.  A proper verifiable article on <a href="" title="gerbilling">gerbilling</a> (which the deleted content is not) could probably be written, using sources written by experts writing in their fields of expertise, including Noreen Dresser: folklorist, anthropologist, and <i>Los Angeles Times</i> columnist.  <a href="" title="Jan Harold Brunvand">Jan Harold Brunvand</a> has covered it, too.  None of those sources give Gere prominence, or even detail him at all.  (Dresser doesn&#39;t name him, for example.  Neither does Brunvand.)  This is, quite simply, something that <i>isn&#39;t about Gere</i>.  Even if we had a proper article on the subject, it would barely touch upon him, since <i>the sources don&#39;t</i>.</li></ul>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> The <a href="" title="Richard Gere">Richard Gere</a> article has been full-protected by an uninvolved admin for &#34;Excessive violations of the <a href="" title="WP:BLP">biographies of living persons policy</a>&#34;; protection to expire in two weeks.  — <a href="" title="User:Becksguy">Becksguy</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Becksguy">talk</a>) 04:05, 5 April 2009 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Just a note, I&#39;m not sure that this can really be considered &#39;resolved&#39;. Yes, the protection has kept the BLP violation out for now, but there&#39;s still great disagreement on the article&#39;s talk page as to whether or not BLP even applies here. It would be helpful if someone else could aid in the discussion in terms of the <i>policy</i> (either for, or against), to help us break from the somewhat redundant circular arguments about notability and such.</dd>
<dd>I really believe (though this is merely my personal opinion) that personal preferences (along with mild canvassing) are starting to trump the actual policies on these matters. In any event, a fresh opinion (again, for <i>or</i> against) might be beneficial, considering the nature of the material that may be reintroduced in about a week. <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/209.90.133.75">209.90.133.75</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:209.90.133.75">talk</a>) 20:17, 10 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Take a look at <a href="" title="Karl Keating">Karl Keating</a> he is one of the biggest, well known Catholic apologists out there. If anyone deserves a long, detailed biography (i.e., relevance) he does, yet he gets a few measly paragraphs. Why? Because no one wants to attack him. This is a biography of a living person, and clearly it is getting out of control.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>Wikipedia is being used as a platform to extend what is being done on the general internet to attack Robert Sungenis. Please unblock me. We need to discuss this, and the notice for biographies of living persons needs to be put back up to remind everyone of the policies. The article is not proportionate to other similar articles on Wikipedia. It sticks out like a sore thumb. <a href="" title="User:Wyattmj">Wyattmj</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wyattmj">talk</a>) 14:10, 9 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>This article is getting way out of hand. It is being used to track every movement of Robert Sungenis and then used as a launch pad to attack him.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s review the BLP policy:</p>
<p>&#34;Wikipedia is a high-profile, widely-viewed website with an international scope, which means that material we publish about living people can affect their lives and the lives of their families, colleagues, and friends. Biographical material must therefore be written with strict adherence to our content policies.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;The article should document, in a non-partisan manner, what reliable secondary sources have published about the subject and, in some circumstances, what the subject may have published about themselves.&#34;</p>
<p>Reliable secondary sources are mainstream magazines, news reports, etc. Not internet chatter. Most of what is in this article is from Sungenis&#39; own writings, with mainly Liam Patrick&#39;s interpretation. This is original research.</p>
<p>From original research:</p>
<p>&#34;Original research is research that is not exclusively based on a summary, review or synthesis of earlier publications on the subject of research. This material is of a primary source character. &#34;</p>
<p>This is what is occuring here.</p>
<p>Back to BLP:</p>
<p>&#34;Criticism and praise of the subject should be represented if it is relevant to the subject&#39;s notability and can be sourced to reliable secondary sources, and so long as the material is written in a manner that does not overwhelm the article or appear to take sides;&#34;</p>
<p>The article is overwhelmed by Liam Patrick&#39;s (and others to be fair) original research based on Sungenis&#39; writings.</p>
<p>&#34;When writing about a person notable only for one or two events, including every detail can lead to problems, even when the material is well-sourced. In the best case, it can lead to an unencyclopedic article. In the worst case, it can be a serious violation of our policies on neutrality. When in doubt, biographies should be pared back to a version that is completely sourced, neutral, and on-topic.&#34;</p>
<p>&#34;n the case of significant public figures, there will be a multitude of reliable, third-party published sources to take material from, and Wikipedia biographies should simply document what these sources say. &#34;</p>
<p>Obviously there is not an overwhelming amount of third party material, so Robert Sungenis is not to be considered a &#34;significant public figure&#34;.</p>
<p>&#34;Wikipedia also contains biographies of people who, while notable enough for an entry, are not generally well known. In such cases, exercise restraint and include only material relevant to their notability, while omitting information that is irrelevant to the subject&#39;s notability. Material from third-party primary sources should not be used unless it has first been published by a reliable secondary source. Material published by the subject must be used with caution.&#34;</p>
<p>I see lack of caution, especially in using even Sungenis&#39; own material, which is being turned into original research.</p>
<p>I understand that Patrick Liam is frustrated that he cannot use the attack websites and blogs as sources, so he has turned to Sungenis&#39; own writings to attempt to follow the policy guidelins. Godd for him. Unfortunately this has turned into Liam Patrick&#39;s original research.Proportionality is highly skewed in this article. Karl Keating is one of the best known, most active Catholic apologists out there, and compare the articles. Mr. Keating&#39;s article is encyclopedic. Robert SUngnis&#39; is not.

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>What I see is something that looks like a board member of Sungenis&#39; organization trying his best to keep Sungenis&#39; controversial and troubled history out of the public view as best as possible again.  ;-) (That is you, right? WyattMJ - Mark Wyatt? If not, let me know!) I still find it very strange because Sungenis is no such shrinking violet - he seems to unabashedly thrive on the public controversy. His board member Mark Wyatt, not so much! LOL. I disagree that it is original research to cite Sungenis&#39; own words, writings and works on very public issues and developments. It looks like WyattMJ kind of wants to have it both ways again. We already went through this a year or two ago. We can&#39;t cite the third parties who have carefully documented the issues related to Sungenis&#39; multiple controversies because they aren&#39;t good enough for him - even though Sungenis himself has written back and forth, arguing with these very individuals on his own website. And I kind of notice that WyattMJ never challenges the factual accuracy of the work cited, which is interesting. Then, when citations are given from Sungenis&#39; own words and works on the very topics under consideration, he claims that it is &#34;original research.&#34; Well, that&#39;s ridiculous.  :-) We&#39;ve already gone through this before. This is why it looks as if he&#39;s striving again to find a way to exclude every source that accurately and thoroughly documents Sungenis&#39; controversial history so that people don&#39;t see it - or see very, very little of it.</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>And as for Karl Keating - why Keating&#39;s article has so little that is troubled or controversial compared to Sungenis? Well, perhaps because Keating has not been any where near as controversial and hasn&#39;t gotten into the kinds of situations that Sungenis has? Maybe? I&#39;ll bet we don&#39;t find a lot of controversy and trouble being written about in the articles on Scott Hahn or Benedict Groeschel, either. I haven&#39;t looked, but it&#39;s just a hunch.</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I suggest that rather than cutting out material, Sungenis&#39; board member adds more material that he thinks is positive to balance it out. The material is accurate, I and others have checked and rechecked it. It has been plainly out in public, it is legitimate information that people have a right to know about - it&#39;s not exactly hidden by Sungenis himself!</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>So, by all means - he should add some more sections on other topics. It has been a while since those kinds of things have been updated. As his board member, WyattMJ probably knows quite a bit about that. So he should go for it!  :-)</dd>
<dd>One little note - something that just got cut out of the article (not by me) was originally put in by WyattMJ and it didn&#39;t have a source. It was from an unpublished letter from his bishop&#39;s vicar. But I left it in all this time because it seemed well-attested and factual, backed up by other statements Sungenis has made in other places.</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>This article has been problematic for POV, OR and BLP for months, and recently underwent a major revision.  The questionable material is being re-introduced into the article.

<dd>I&#39;m previously uninvolved, but I do see a problem here. The section on his &#34;degrees&#34; alleges a controversy, but does not detail it. Things are not controversial because they are verifiability contradictory (that&#39;s OR) they are controversial because someone has criticised him for it, and the criticism is significant. This sections needs clear attribution &#34;controversy emerged when x said y, and what x is saying is z&#34;.--<a href="" title="User talk:Scott MacDonald">Scott Mac (Doc)</a> 17:40, 10 April 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>There is not the least problem showing it in detail. The person who brought this here objected to including the details on grounds of BLP. As everything was in fact sourced, including from material published by or with the cooperation of the subject of the article, the complaint  seemed to be based on proportional weight. The amount of space devoted to was therefore reduced to a minimum. if it is felt balance requires more, it&#39;s all in the page history. This is not a problem with BLP, except to the extent that someone is trying to censor the article to reflect a unreasonably positive, rather than a neutral POV.  I have asked ibinthinking several times to specify just what he thinks libellous in the present article, and have gotten no clear response. I think the specific  content he objects to is presenting the material as a table, and in my opinion, that is because the table presentation shows the information clearly. Scott on a note on the page objects to including the word controversy, but I think this is documented but the documentation was by and large removed as emphasising the negative.. The material can just as readily presented without using that word. The actual fact of the variation in his report of degrees, and the fact that all but a bachelor&#39;s degree come from unaccredited schools with a timing that suggests that little or no academic work was done for them, is obviously pertinent to the career of a college president. In fairness, the article came to my attention because of complaints from an editor who finally admitted to be representing the college that there was unsourced negative material being inserted--and so there was, by the editor Trust Truth, with negative innuendoes in a remarkably unfair way, one of the worst hatchet jobs I&#39;ve seen here.  I started removing it, and others continued.  I know I sound a little impatient, but that&#39;s because I have little confidence in the good faith of either of the two contending parties, especially after repeated emails from some of them. This complaint is an attempt to whitewash a biography.there are also repeated suggestions and attempts from opposite parties to delete the article, based on an apparent view that if does not reflect their own viewpoint, whether unduly negative or unduly positive. then it is better not to have the article.  This is a case of our BLP policy working properly to get an article neutral despite repeated and consistent efforts to bias it in opposite directions. NPOV applies to BLP, although the subjects and their critics may wish otherwise. To the extent that Ibinthinking represents the subject he should be glad we removed the actual bias against him, and let it rest there.  <b><a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> (<a href="" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a>) 18:05, 10 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I absolutely disagree with DGG&#39;s characterization here.  As I have noted repeatedly on the talk page for the article, the sources that are cited to support the allegations made by TrustTruth against the subject of the article, namely, that he published contradictory chronologies of his educational history and fabricated degrees, do not establish the assertion.  I further have noted that his inclusion of cached CV&#39;s constitutes original research and his insistence on leading the reader to draw conclusions about the character and competence of the subject, and his repeated sensationalizing of discrepancies of the subject&#39;s past (which the subject himself disclosed years ago of his own volition, and in several places), and his emphasis on &#34;controversy&#34; that is not a notable feature of the subject&#39;s life (other than as a DIRECT result of this editor&#39;s OR for WP) constitute a serious problem for this article.  I have engaged the discussion of how to fairly represent the less flattering aspects of the subject&#39;s history and have never shied away from including them in the article, as will be noted by my edits and my discussion.  I appeal to administrators to review the previous versions of the article (TrustTruth himself provides a convenient link in the article&#39;s talk page to the version he seems to be recommending as more appropriate), as well as the discussion on the talk page.  DGG&#39;s accusation that I am trying to whitewash the biography is unfounded, and I believe any objective analysis of my edits and of my attempts to reason with the other editors will vindicate me. </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Varg_Vikernes_Entry_is_Troubled">Varg Vikernes Entry is Troubled</span></h2>

<p>Hi.  I want to bring the <a href="" title="Varg Vikernes">Varg Vikernes</a> page to people&#39;s attention.  The whole discussion board is a mess and filled with supporters of the guy.  These are people who will dispute, obscure, or even remove, information that Vikernes is a convicted murderer because they believe he is innocent.  This has a tendency to seep into the article itself, and has been doing so for a long time now.  I&#39;ve had legitimate citations removed apparently because they revealed his racist, pseudo-neo-Nazi ideology a little too clearly.  I made the edits on 09/27/08, and I have not logged in since.  I found today that not only were they deleted, but that two different people made their way to my talk page and accused me of libel and improper editing, with an air of authority that they clearly do not have.  FYI, I have more than enough academic education to know about proper citations.  I can post the quotes in question if requested, or inquisitive minds can check my edit history and go to the edits in questions (09/27/08).</p>
<p>To make a long story short, here is the core of the problem:  Vikernes, an obscure Norwegian musician, has a small, but rabid cult following.  They have made it clear through edits and explicitly clear on the discussion page that the only true credible source on the topic of Varg Vikernes is...Varg Vikernes.  Surprise, surprise.  </p>
<p>To the people in charge of this project, PLEASE keep a close eye on this one.  Put it on the watch list.  At least put up a disclaimer on there.  People are actively making edits that use Vikernes&#39; own writing on his web page as a source.  Not only that, but they are claiming on the discussion board that his webpage is a more credible source than anything else out there.  Keep in mind he is a convicted murderer, and all credible evidence points to him being both a pathological liar and someone in a perpetual state of identity crisis.  When I made a comment on the discussion board, admittedly an opinionated one, that the section detailing the murder was clearly written with the intent of making Vikernes appear wrongly accused and unjustly imprisoned, the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Varg_Vikernes#Murderer" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Varg_Vikernes#Murderer">reply</a> I got was this: &#60;i&#62;&#34;Think about it for a second - Varg&#39;s account of the murder is the most accurate one, because Euronymous &#60;/i&#62;[the victim]&#60;i&#62; can&#39;t exactly give his side of the story, and Snorre was having a smoke outside while it happened. Also, there&#39;s no reason for Varg to lie about the murder, he&#39;s already been in prison for 14 years... its not like lying is going to get him out.&#34; (<a href="" title="Temple-of-Monkeys">Temple-of-Monkeys</a>)&#60;/i&#62;  I rest my case, sirs and madams.</p>
<p>There are people who are actively making an effort to keep things objective on the page, but it is clear this battle has been going on for far too long to not have an administrator put this article on notice.  With the fact that Vikernes has been granted parole after serving 16 years of a 21 year sentence, I can only see things getting worse.  The ultimate reason this article needs tending to is not because he is an important guy, but because he is another right-wing extremist mental-case with a following, and these people need to be kept in check.

<li>The issue that&#39;s probably best dealt with here is whether adding a &#34;criminal&#34; category to someone notably convicted of a felony violates BLP. If someone is sentenced to a year or more in prison, and loses his career due to the crime, is it undue weight to add a category to reflect that? That is the argument, and a specific case being offered is <a href="" title="Otto Kerner, Jr.">Otto Kerner, Jr.</a>, a governor of Illinois who was later appointed federal judge. He was later convicted of having accepted bribes as governor, forcing his resignation from the bench. Where does BLP demand that we avoid adding the article to <a href="" title="Category:Americans convicted of bribery">Category:Americans convicted of bribery</a>? &#38;nbsp; &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User:Will Beback">&#60;font color=&#34;#595454&#34;&#62;Will Beback&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; <a href="" title="User talk:Will Beback">&#60;font color=&#34;#C0C0C0&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp; &#60;/b&#62; 05:50, 3 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Americans convicted of bribery is waaaaaay better than American Criminals.  It labels the act, not the person. Not sure why you ask for it to go back to the BLP noticeboard and then use Otto Kerner as the archetype, but, lets pretend he&#39;s alive.  The most notable thing he did was the Kerner Commission, which was prescient about the causes of urban rioting and the central factors of class, poverty and race. He was a Governor, a judge, and a bribe-taker.  All the facts belong in the article.  But the values embodied in BLP, and in the guidelines about categorization of people (living or dead) argue for the editorial discretion that favors the &#34;convicted of bribery&#34; cat over the American criminal one. <a href="" title="User:David in DC">David in DC</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David in DC">talk</a>) 07:15, 3 April 2009 (UTC)

<dd>People convicted of crime are called &#34;criminals&#34;. We have <a href="" title="Category:American criminals">Category:American criminals</a> which has many subcategories to cover specific crimes. The only people who should be in the parent categories are those who don&#39;t happen to fit into any of the subcategories, just like with any category. So if the crime is notable and well-sourced, where is the BLP violation? Even if the subject has done other wonderful things, that doesn&#39;t erase the criminal conviction. <a href="" title="Martha Stewart">Martha Stewart</a> has done many things besides making false statements to federal investigators, but she was notably convicted of having done so.

<dd>That wasn&#39;t the issue raised, Collect. The issue is whether the event has been given undue weight. I think to a great degree that it is given undue weight, as the search controversy can better be covered in depth at the rather newly created <a href="" title="Ohio Department of Job and Family Services database search controversy">Ohio Department of Job and Family Services database search controversy</a>. At a minimum, I think <a href="#Ohio_newspaper_editorial_comments_on_Jones-Kelley" title="Helen_Jones-Kelley">Helen_Jones-Kelley</a> needs to be removed from the article about Jones-Kelly. This is a BLP, and hopefully our readers are able to draw their own conclusions about her actions and don&#39;t need negative editorials to tell them how to feel. <a href="" title="User:AniMate">&#60;font face=&#34;Zapfino&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;AniMate&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;sup&#62;&#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:AniMate">&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 00:03, 1 April 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - I agree with Ism schism&#39;s approach and have the following comments:</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Right now both the Joe the Plumber and Helen Jones Kelly articles have long sections about the database controversy that are overlapping.  There is a main article dedicated to the controversy which allows for summary and wikilinking.</li>
<li>Furthermore there are instances where the language should be more neutral.  A previous version of the section contained language with speculation and innuendo that the actions by Jones-Kelly were illegal. We now know that no laws were broken by Jones-Kelly when she asked a subordinate to do the database searches.  An official investigation found no evidence that laws were broken.  For this reason, there is no purpose to include past speculation that they could have been &#34;illegal.&#34;  </li>
<li>Likewise the catalog of negative editorials in the Jones-Kelly article are gratuitous. We can do better than that. <a href="" title="User:Mattnad">Mattnad</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mattnad">talk</a>) 09:12, 1 April 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<li><b>Comment</b> Well, I don&#39;t see anything there right now that violates <a href="" title="WP:BLP">WP:BLP</a>, but the article&#39;s style is rather bad. The lead doesn&#39;t describe Jones-Kelley&#39;s involvement in the Joe the Plumber scandal, and is rather terribly vague. Similarly, the section on the document scandal uses passive voice and refrains from describing her actions, which is also, IMO, going too far and compromising Wikipedia&#39;s quality. &#60;strong&#62;<a href="" title="User:RayAYang">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:DarkRed&#34;&#62;Ray&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/strong&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:RayAYang">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&#34;&#62;Talk&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 21:56, 12 April 2009 (UTC)</li>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="LBGT_category_used_inappropriately.3F">LBGT category used inappropriately?</span></h2>

<p> 
 </p>
<p>Hello. I&#39;m concerned about the use of the LBGT category in the Lindsay Lohan article.
&#60;br/&#62;It isn&#39;t that I think she&#39;s obviously straight or anything (having a girlfriend, ex or not, kinda makes it hard to make a claim like that with a straight face). However, the <a href="#Categories" title="Wikipedia:BLP">BLP policy page</a> says that you can&#39;t add that sort of category unless they &#34;self-identify&#34; as such.
&#60;br/&#62;The article includes two relevant quotes. In relation to her being bisexual, she says, &#34;Maybe. Yeah.&#34; (So, it&#39;s a little iffy, but an argument <i>could</i> be made for including it, in spite of the &#39;maybe&#39;) But she then follows it with a disclaimer, <b>&#34;I don&#39;t want to classify myself.&#34;</b> It would seem, to me, that that insufficiently meets the &#34;self-identifying&#34; requirement. (saying, &#34;I don&#39;t want to classify myself&#34; seems close enough to, &#34;I don&#39;t want to categorize myself)
&#60;br/&#62;Anyways, the category has been removed before, for precisely that reason, but it then got re-added (without even an edit summary). It originally got readded with a &#39;lesbian&#39; category (in spite of her <i>explicitly</i> stating that she isn&#39;t lesbian), but only that one got removed by another editor.
&#60;br/&#62;I&#39;ve made a note on the article&#39;s talk page, but sometimes those aren&#39;t used very much and I lack the ability to edit it myself, so I prefer to list these types of concerns on the BLP noticeboard as well. (in other words, I think a discussion fits the article&#39;s talk page best, but I felt this was the best way to get the attention of people familiar with BLP policy) <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/209.90.133.75">209.90.133.75</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:209.90.133.75">talk</a>) 18:15, 11 April 2009 (UTC)
</p>
<dl>
<dd>Gosh, all we know is that she had an open and widely covered romantic relationship with another notable celebrity, who is female.  Maybe there is a category for that, e.g. &#34;famous same sex celebrity couples&#34; or &#34;famous celebrity couples&#34;.  If there isn&#39;t an appropriate category it could indicate that it is not worth categorizing.  It may still be of interest to a project on sexuality.  But indeed, use of categories to indicate personal details that are disputed or unsourced in the text (in this case sexual orientation) is problematic.  <a href="" title="User:Wikidemon">Wikidemon</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wikidemon">talk</a>) 02:17, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The folk at <a href="" title="WP:LGBT">WP:LGBT</a> come across this often. We watch articles of BLPs who are rumored at least to be in same sex relationships. We actively remove the category from <a href="" title="Jodie Foster">Jodie Foster</a> because her own statements do not confirm the type of relationship she has/had with another woman. However, Lohan has confirmed she is/was in a relationship with another woman. Though she does not wish to categorize herself as lesbian or bisexual, she has neither denied being in a relationship with another woman similar to <a href="" title="Michelle Rodriguez">Michelle Rodriguez</a> who <i>has</i> denied it, or <a href="" title="Little Richard">Little Richard</a>, who claims he was gay and is no longer so. I am not cognizant of all the things Lohan has said about her relationship with Ronson, but it is clear that she has never denied it. I believe a similar issue arose with <a href="" title="Angelina Jolie">Angelina Jolie</a>, who admitted she is attracted to men and women, but never used the term &#34;bisexual&#34;.

<dd>Her article should remain tagged with the LGBT Project since it covers any information/persons regarding same-sex relationships (Lohan not only confirmed she was in a relationship but claimed to be in love when she discussed their break-up), but I wouldn&#39;t add any particular category (i.e. Bisexual women) since it is entirely possible she may never date another woman again and &#34;identify&#34; as &#34;straight&#34; from this point forward (regardless of whether or not anyone believes it). <a href="" title="User:Bookkeeperoftheoccult">&#60;span style=&#34;color:black&#34;&#62;<b><i>The Bookkeeper</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Bookkeeperoftheoccult">&#60;small&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:gray&#34;&#62;(<b><i>of the Occult</i></b>)&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62;</a> 19:20, 12 April 2009 (UTC)

<dd>A project tag is not the same as a category. She&#39;s certainly within the scope of the project, regardless of her sexual orientation. We used to have a disclaimer, or an optional parameter to the project banner where we could add a disclaimer that use of the project tag in no way symbolizes anyone&#39;s sexual orientation. I haven&#39;t seen it used in a long time and forget which BLP article it was that caused us to add that option in the first place. Regardless, project tags aren&#39;t BLP violations. <b>-</b> &#60;font size=&#34;+1&#34; color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;&#38;#10032;&#60;/font&#62;&#60;strong style=&#34;letter-spacing:1px;font-family:Verdana&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Allstarecho">ALLST☆R</a>&#60;/strong&#62;&#60;font size=&#34;+1&#34; color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;&#38;#10032;&#60;/font&#62; &#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Allstarecho">echo</a>&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 19:04, 13 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Comment</b> the talkpage LGBT banner is a no-brainer, whether she outs herself or not, her same-sex relationship with Ronson is widely publicized so the LGBT project can help there.

I&#39;m wholeheartedly against catergorizing anyone who does not wish to be catergorized, which as an open LGBT person I&#39;m am ashamed to say we often get so swept up in the movement we forget its not our place to drag people out of the closet kicking and screaming.

<dd>[Deleted subsection header; Rewritten intro]: Here&#39;s the context of what Atzmon actually says showing the quote out of context is POV:
<dl>
<dd>ATZMON: <i>Noticeably, when writing to Jews, Cohen allows himself to employ the most racist ideas and expressions. “As long as the conspiracy theories of the counter-enlightenment come from ideologues with dark rather than white skins, nominally liberal men and women will not speak out.” Someone should remind the Observer columnist that ideologies do not have ‘skin’ and ideologues cannot choose the colour of their skin either. Hence, referring to ideologues with dark skin is far beyond bigotry. It is racism per se. And yet, Cohen will get away with it because he is ‘Kosher’ as he himself admitted. In contemporary Britain a Dutch right-wing racist MP is deported for making a film, yet a racist can be a prominent columnist for the Observer. This is actually a good thing. It is probably the last remnant of Britain’s legendary liberalism. In the UK bigotry and racism is becoming a Jews-only territory. You might want to ask yourself why we stop a Dutch MP yet we let Melanie Philips and Nick Cohen celebrate their symptoms on paper. One possible answer is that we expect a Dutch Christian to be a Humanist, yet we allow the racially orientated tribal campaigner to be a racist bigot.  We expect them to advocate wars, we expect them to refer to people’s skin and colour.</i></dd>

<p>This is all very hard to follow - I took a look and ended up changing something else.  Wikipedia coverage of any person that controversial in the political arena, who uses such charged language, is going to present some thorny BLP and NPOV issues.  How to get the gist of what he is about, and the context, without implicitly endorsing either him or his critics?  This particular issue looks to be more of a sourcing problem than a BLP or NPOV problem.  The quote in question is &#34;In the UK bigotry and racism is becoming a Jews-only territory&#34;.  He did write that, didn&#39;t he?  It&#39;s hardly a BLP violation against Atzmon to repeat what he said.  But I agree that it should either be put in context or not included at all.  Provocative words, out of context, confuse more than they enlighten.  But what basis is there for putting it in context?  I could find no reliable sources that comment on what he meant by that, only an analysis of his own words.  Trying to explain it, with reference to his own piece, is a form of original research.  We&#39;re supposed to simply report on what the sources say, not conduct an analysis of them. <a href="" title="User:Wikidemon">Wikidemon</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wikidemon">talk</a>) 16:03, 11 April 2009 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Oh, and regarding the BLP vio against Nick Cohen, that&#39;s unavoidable because it&#39;s in the title.  One partial solution, which might be a bit awkward, is to avoid repeating that title in the body of the article.  If it must be repeated inline as an attribution you could say something like &#34;In an opinion piece written in 2009,[cite] Atzmon...&#34;  But to repeat the above point, and after reading both Cohen&#39;s and Atzmon&#39;s editorials, those can&#39;t really be used at all without a third party trying to explain them.  Trying to sift through opposing partisans&#39; incendiary essays to figure out which way the flames are flying really does seem like original research.  <a href="" title="User:Wikidemon">Wikidemon</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wikidemon">talk</a>) 16:10, 11 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Perhaps a solution is to include only the quote, and have the title available in the link, the statement itself is extremely relevant to Atzmon&#39;s views a well as the tone of the article, as he declares racism to be a Jewish trait(not a trait of Nick Cohen) it is completely irrelavent to the topic to include his criticisms of Nick Cohen, as the article is not about Nick Cohen, however as criticisms of Jewish identity are central to Atzmon&#39;s writings, and he has already described Judaism as &#34;&#34;very much a supremacist, racist tendency&#34; It is important to include hi statement that &#34;In the UK bigotry and racism is becoming a Jews-only territory.&#34; It is in line with and reinforces his earlier statements, I can see no legitimate reason for it not to be included. <a href="" title="User:Drsmoo">Drsmoo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Drsmoo">talk</a>) 20:20, 11 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>The problem is a) it&#39;s self-published opinion and we were trying to keep that sort of thing down to a minimum on important issues; b) by itself it&#39;s a throw a way line that just makes him look bad taken out of context and c) the only context is that Atzmon is charging Cohen with racism; at the very least that whole paragraph would have to be quoted, if a summary is considered WP:OR. But that&#39;s a self-published claim vs. Cohen which is vs. BLP. Those three issues together make it vs. BLP to include the quote at all. <a href="" title="User:Carolmooredc">CarolMooreDC</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Carolmooredc">talk</a>) 22:21, 11 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I agree with Wikidemon, the best way forward is to insert the quote and allow it to stand for itself. The meaning is clear, any attempt to &#34;explain&#34; it is simply more POV. A paragraph on Nick Cohen is simply irrelavent to the article, not to mention that his use of Melanie Philips(also Jewish) as an example of &#34;racial tribalism&#34;(as Atzmon puts it.) His attribution of Racism to the Jewish epople as a whole has no relavence to Nick Cohen, and it is an argument he has made many times before. <a href="" title="User:Drsmoo">Drsmoo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Drsmoo">talk</a>) 01:29, 12 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

It&#39;s stale, uninformative, and unencyclopedic to have an article that stops with the charges and arrest in 2007. <a href="" title="User:David in DC">David in DC</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:David in DC">talk</a>) 17:06, 10 April 2009 (UTC)

<dd>  just updated the article with information that a subset of charges were dismissed on 6 March 2009 but others left intact, so this case has clearly not been decided yet.  I don&#39;t think BLP forbids having articles about cases that are active, and it looks to me like everything is neutral and well-sourced at this point.  (Note also that the suspect&#39;s name actually never appears in the article, although it is available in the referenced sources.) <a href="" title="User:Looie496">Looie496</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Looie496">talk</a>) 16:30, 11 April 2009 (UTC)

<dd>On second thought, the notability of the whole thing could be questioned. But still the fact that someone is sending pipe-bombs through the mail is somewhat more notable than the fact that someone got arrested for it.  Even if he is found guilty his notability is questionable since no one was hurt.  But an unknown terrorist out there at large is worth mentioning. <a href="" title="User:Steve Dufour">Steve Dufour</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Steve Dufour">talk</a>) 07:19, 16 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I don&#39;t see the abuse of process - can you be more specific about how a request for comments is a tactic to avoid discussion? This talkpage could definitely use a wider audience because while the new version seems (to me) be an obvious improvement, the reception to the RfC is unaccountably mixed. (Also, any theories as to how we got three users named Zoe responding to the same RfC?) <a href="" title="User:Avruch">&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;Avruch&#60;/strong&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Avruch">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;  T  &#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 18:53, 16 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Benjiboi was repeatedly given the chance to discuss perceived problems with the existing consensus version but just reverted back to their version, which seems to be a common tactic employed by that user. A point-by-point discussion that I attempted to start at the end of &#34;Recent edits undone&#34; on the talk page was ignored, instead Benjiboi just posted the RfC asking people to comment on the two versions without referencing the extensive prior discussions on the topic. RfCs are a mechanism to promote discussion on an issue, not to mis-state the nature of a dispute in an attempt to force through one&#39;s own pet rewrite of an issue without being willing to engage in discussion on a topic. If you haven&#39;t already, I&#39;d ask that you check out the earlier entries on the talk page and in the archive - it&#39;s not just one users work but the consensus view that he&#39;s claiming suffers from POV issues. The proposed version just pushes the pro-Bindel line and falls foul of POV issues even more so. <a href="" title="User:Zoeoconnell">Zoe O&#39;Connell &#60;span style=&#34;color:red&#34;&#62;⚢⚧&#60;/span&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Zoeoconnell">talk</a>) 19:43, 16 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>I agree that the title should be changed, preferably without mentioning Jennifer at all, since she is not the notable person in all this. The incident it only notable because of the link to President Bush, and the title should reflect that. Take <a href="" title="1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson">1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson</a> as a example. The title needs to mention the incident (child sexual abuse, or adultery in this case), the notable person (Michael Jackson, or Bush in this case). Finally the title needs to clarify that nothing has been proven, so &#34;accusation&#34; or &#34;allegation&#34; thrown in will help. Titles with words such as &#34;controversy&#34; or &#34;scandal&#34; should be avoided. — <a href="" title="User:Realist2">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#4173E4&#34;&#62;<b><i>R</i></b>&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User_talk:Realist2">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#D80B0B&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<b><i>2</i></b>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/span&#62;</a> 18:58, 19 April 2009 (UTC)</p>

It does not state or reference any of Council President Conyers accomplishments as a teacher, an public school administrator, nor a President pro tempor of City Council nor as President. I have a serious problem with bigoted pages created with no facts but just the opinions of others who do not like her.

<dd>Well, the claims in the article all seemed to be sourced. Is there anything in particular you&#39;re challenging? Also, for any achievements she has, feel free to add those to the article and include a source for them. If you need help with that, just post it here. <a href="" title="User:Jennavecia">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Lucida Handwriting Italic;color:#9B30FF&#34;&#62;<b>ل</b>enna&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Jennavecia">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Lucida Handwriting Italic;color:#63B8FF&#34;&#62;vecia&#60;/span&#62;</a> 04:48, 19 April 2009 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Tony_Veitch"><a href="" title="Tony Veitch">Tony Veitch</a></span></h2>

<p>I am concerned that the majority of the article deals with the fallout from his assault on his partner, and only a little with the illustrious career which preceded the details becoming public less than a year ago. On the other hand, the events of the past year have had massive publicity in New Zealand, for example his conviction a few days ago was given the first ten minutes of the hour-long prime time news on TV3 (and probably a similar coverage on the other main channel), and occupied much of the front page and all of page 2 of the New Zealand Herald the following day. The accuracy of testimonials were again headlined on the television news and in the newspapers a day later, and his suicide attempt yesterday was the lead story on TV3 yesterday and in the Herald this morning. Such coverage has been frequent since July last year.</p>
<p>Our article is reasonably well-sourced, and I believe it is neutral in tone. While it was created in response to the assault details becoming public in July 2008, it would have been reasonable for an article to have been created on Veitch as a well known sports broadcaster before that. This isn&#39;t someone famous only for one event, although he has certainly become much more famous in New Zealand as a result of that event. There is no problem with the behaviour of any editor of the article. In short, this is not a flagrant abuse of the BLP policy.</p>
<p>I feel uneasy about the article although it&#39;s only a tiny proportion of the flood of material in the NZ media about Veitch at the moment. Is it okay for the article to have its current weighting, or is this &#34;undue weight&#34;? Is it acceptable to leave it for a few years in the hope that new material will be added on his past and future endeavours, and eventually this will become one section of many documenting his life. Should we attempt to reduce the detail in the article to improve the balance? For example, we could remove most of the &#34;Resignation from media work&#34; section.-&#60;font face=&#34;cursive&#34; color=&#34;#808080&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:gadfium">gadfium</a>&#60;/font&#62; 05:06, 19 April 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It seems that you are in a better position to answer these questions than anybody unfamiliar with the story would be.  Are your questions rhetorical, or do you actually expect some useful input here? <a href="" title="User:Looie496">Looie496</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Looie496">talk</a>) 02:07, 20 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>My question is whether the present article is acceptable under the BLP criteria, and if not then what is the most productive approach to take to fix it. It isn&#39;t a rhetorical question.-&#60;font face=&#34;cursive&#34; color=&#34;#808080&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:gadfium">gadfium</a>&#60;/font&#62; 02:29, 20 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I&#39;m really not trying to be snarky -- I think you&#39;re in a better position to answer that question than anybody else around here.  Do what you think is right, and if you meet resistance, then there will be something specific to ask for help with.  If there are sources t back up the statements, it basically comes down to issues of appropriate weight, and that&#39;s always best judged by somebody familiar with the topic. <a href="" title="User:Looie496">Looie496</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Looie496">talk</a>) 02:58, 20 April 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
