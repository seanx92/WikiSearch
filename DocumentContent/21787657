<p>The result was <b>Redirect to <a href="#Dog_Poop_Girl" title="Internet_vigilantism">Internet_vigilantism</a></b>.  Never mind all the circular arguments about BLP and BLP1E, what it boils down to is that this news story - and that is exactly what it is (<a href="#NEWS" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a> anyone)? isn&#39;t notable enough to stand as an individual article.  In the <a href="" title="Internet vigilantism">Internet vigilantism</a> article, however, it works fine.  I haven&#39;t deleted the history, so anything else that people would like to move over to the other article is there, but I&#39;d suggest that people don&#39;t try to recreate this article in the other one.  A certain level of detail is fine. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Black Kite">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Black Kite&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/b&#62; 10:58, 8 March 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> - The Boxxy article was deleted because it lacked <a href="" title="WP:RS">reliable sources</a>. The references for that article were all blogs, which don&#39;t qualify.

<dd>BLP. We need to write articles about people (what this ostensibly is) with respect to their privacy. Even if no-one else did. As it stands, this person is notable for only one event.

<li><b>Delete</b> I voted to keep this way back in 2006, but it doesn&#39;t fit our community standards currently in light of BLP.  Perhaps some aspects could be merged into other articles though. <a href="" title="User:Starblind">Andrew Lenahan</a> - &#60;b&#62;&#60;FONT COLOR=&#34;#FF0000&#34;&#62;St&#60;/FONT&#62;&#60;FONT COLOR=&#34;#FF5500&#34;&#62;ar&#60;/FONT&#62;&#60;FONT COLOR=&#34;#FF8000&#34;&#62;bli&#60;/FONT&#62;&#60;FONT COLOR=&#34;#FFC000&#34;&#62;nd&#60;/FONT&#62;&#60;/b&#62; 13:45, 3 March 2009 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> I can see no guideline that limits the amount of times an article can be nominated. I suspect the list of AfD&#39;s for this article may keep growing until it eventually gets deleted. &#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid deeppink;font-size:70%;padding:2px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Jenuk1985">&#60;font color=&#34;deeppink&#34;&#62;Jenuk1985&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;|&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Jenuk1985">&#60;font color=&#34;deeppink&#34;&#62;Talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62; 14:45, 3 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>regardless of article merit, that would an inappropriate use of AfD. After only 4 nominations, given a 20% variation in results, there&#39;s over a 50% chance of deleting anything. <b><a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> (<a href="" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a>) 14:58, 3 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I think you have misunderstood me, I&#39;m not saying that I am going to keep renominating it, its just that I feel that its likely to be renominated multiple times. This certainly won&#39;t be the last AfD for this article. &#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid deeppink;font-size:70%;padding:2px;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Jenuk1985">&#60;font color=&#34;deeppink&#34;&#62;Jenuk1985&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#38;nbsp;|&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:Jenuk1985">&#60;font color=&#34;deeppink&#34;&#62;Talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62; 15:05, 3 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - the reason for renomination is based on recent AfDs for similar articles that seem to indicate that the community&#39;s values for this kind of article have changed.  I felt, given concerns (raised by someone on my talk page) that this is not-notable and a single-event internet meme, it doesn&#39;t really meet our inclusion guidelines.  In short, I disregarded the previous AfDs because I felt that consensus on this topic might have changed.  I think the discussion should stick to the article and its notability, not on the procedural point of whether it was ok to nominate it again 9-10 months after the last AfD.

<li>I&#39;m unfamiliar with the details about Boxxy, but the deletion of the cat incident was a clear BLP violation because it focused on the negative actions of a minor. Nearly all the sources mentioned his name and he was the target of 4chan and others who have sworn to hunt the kid down and avenge the cat. That&#39;s clearly a case where privacy should be our primary concern. - <a href="" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic">&#60;sup&#62;(talk)&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 20:30, 7 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<li><b>Comment</b> let&#39;s see the intro of the compared article. <i>Crispus Attucks (c. 1723 – March 5, 1770) was one of five people killed in the Boston Massacre in Boston, Massachusetts. &#60;u&#62;He has been frequently named as the first martyr of the American Revolution and is the only Boston Massacre victim whose name is commonly remembered.&#60;/u&#62; He is regarded as an important and inspirational figure in American history.</i>.

<dd>
<ul>
<li>I am hardly numb to the gravity of what Attucks represents versus the banality of what <a href="" title="Dog poop girl">Dpg</a> represents.  But it&#39;s still an excellent illustrative example.  All we really know about Attucks is that he caught a bullet.  Attucks&#39; notability comes entirely from later discussion of that one brief event. Look at the words in the quote you use...&#34;frequently named&#34;...&#34;commonly remembered&#34;...&#34;he is regarded&#34;...and the rest of the article is the same.  He was at the wrong place at the the right time; the subsequent discussion made him notable.  --<a href="" title="User:Boston">Boston</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Boston">talk</a>) 03:28, 4 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Comment</b>  How would the literal translation be the word &#34;shit&#34;?  The word I assume is Korean or something for feces.  The word &#34;shit&#34; carries with it a large number of different meanings including: feces, stuff, garbage, good stuff, something amazing, etc. -- so it&#39;s different than a generic word for feces. <a href="" title="User:Are you ready for IPv6?">Are you ready for IPv6?</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Are you ready for IPv6?">talk</a>) 07:57, 4 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>This article does not demonstrate any historic notability. It is merely news based on a short burst of news reports about a single event. It fits <b><i>exactly</i></b> with the pattern of things that should not be on wikipedia according to our own policies and guidelines. (FWIW, reference 9 starts to comes near to historic notability - at least someone has reflected on the incident. Were there more coverage in the article of the reaction or even interest after 2005, the article might qualify for historical notability.

<li><b>Decided Keep</b> of this odorferous article. The article is about an event and its many repercussions, and uses as article name, the &#34;name&#34; given the event in sources. The article is about the event and its repercussions, not about the woman. The woman discussed became herself a public figure when she personally made a public apology. So covering her (in)actions, the public&#39;s outcry, the subsequent results, and her public aplogy is not a BLP violation... no more than an article about <a href="" title="Mark David Chapman">Mark David Chapman</a> is a violation. And it does demonstrate hitorical notability as shown by its multiple sources... heck, I love that the failed 2005 deletion effort itself even made the news: <a class="externallink" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/30/arts/30cats.html?_r=1" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/30/arts/30cats.html?_r=1">New York Times</a>.  To those quoting <a href="#NEWS" title="WP:NOT">WP:NOT</a>, it has to be remembered that if it happened today or yesterday, it was news.... but if it happened 4 or 5 or 20 or 50 years ago, it has become history and can be treated properly in retrospect. Point here being is that wikipedia depends quite heavily on &#34;news&#34; as sources for its articles. Nearly everything within these pages was &#34;news&#34; at one time or another. The goal here is to give balanced coverage of a subject and source back to reliable sources... and that has been done. And to thos faling back on <a href="" title="WP:ONEEVENT">WP:ONEEVENT</a> as an argument, this is not a BLP and ONEEVENT does not apply. <b><a href="" title="User:MichaelQSchmidt">&#60;font color=&#34;blue&#34;&#62;Schmidt,&#60;/font&#62;</a></b> <i><a href="" title="User talk:MichaelQSchmidt">&#60;b&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;MICHAEL Q.&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/b&#62;</a></i> 06:13, 7 March 2009 (UTC)
