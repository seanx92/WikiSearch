I did look at <a href="" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Dermatology task force/Categorization">Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine/Dermatology task force/Categorization</a>, skin appendages is only used for this one category so I don&#39;t see replacing this one use as a problem.

<dd><b>Propose renaming</b> <a href="" title="Category:Diseases of skin appendages">Category:Diseases of skin appendages</a> to <a href="" title="Category:Conditions of the skin appendages">Category:Conditions of the skin appendages</a></dd>
<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b> <b>Rename</b>. I started the <a href="" title="WP:DERM">WP:DERM</a> taskforce, and have been working to categorize dermatology articles in an organized fashion. The proposed categorization scheme is specifically at <a href="" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Dermatology_task_force/Categorization">Wikipedia:WikiProject_Medicine/Dermatology_task_force/Categorization</a>, which was developed from discussions at the main wikipedia medicine page (see that link for more details). As per that scheme, the &#34;Diseases of skin appendages&#34; category should probably be renamed to &#34;Conditions of the skin appendages&#34; as the scope of the category is not strictly limited to diseases, but also contains some conditions that can be considered normal findings, such as <a href="" title="melanonychia">melanonychia</a> for example (see <a href="#Conditions_of_the_skin_appendages" title="List_of_skin-related_conditions">List_of_skin-related_conditions</a> for a listing of all the conditions considered part of this category, some of which are not necessarily &#34;diseases&#34;) <a href="" title="User:Kilbad">kilbad</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kilbad">talk</a>) 20:28, 10 January 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> - I wonder if we should use <i>both</i> terms in the category name? (i.e. <a href="" title="Category:Diseases and conditions of skin appendages">Category:Diseases and conditions of skin appendages</a>) This relates very directly to the <a href="#Category:Diseases" title="Wikipedia:Categories_for_discussion/Log/2008_December_2">recent CFD</a> where I argued (successfully) for merging <a href="" title="Category:Diseases">Category:Diseases</a> into <a href="" title="Category:Diseases and disorders">Category:Diseases and disorders</a>. We touched briefly on the term &#34;conditions&#34;, but didn&#39;t reach any conclusions. Btw, I had a look at  , and the work you&#39;ve put into organizing those sub-cats really shows. I&#39;m wondering, though, if it might not be better to use the common term &#34;skin&#34; rather than &#34;cutaneous&#34; for the parent category -- and perhaps also change it to &#34;diseases and conditions&#34; as I&#39;ve suggested for this sub-category? <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 23:43, 10 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First, thank you for your kind words, and I appreciate your input in this area.  I have been working on dermatologic content for several weeks now, and have found categorization of its content very challenging.
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>With regard to this particular category, I have suggested renaming because there are articles that encompass <i>processes</i> that could be considered normal at times, like, for example, <a href="" title="melanonychia">melanonychia</a>, as I cited above.  With that being stated, I have always understood the term &#34;condition,&#34; in the medical sense, to be broader and less specific than disease, &#34;condition&#34; being a term that could include <i>normal</i> variants, this contrasted with the term &#34;disease&#34; which excludes anything normal.  This was my rational in suggesting the <a href="" title="Category:Conditions of the skin appendages">Category:Conditions of the skin appendages</a>, attempting to include diseases and the occasional normal variant within the same category.  Of course, the overwhelming majority of articles in this category will be disease articles, but I wanted to appropriately name the category to include any possible outlying articles.  Therefore, unless my understanding of the word &#34;condition&#34; is off (and I am certainly open to other viewpoints), I would not be in favor of <a href="" title="Category:Diseases and conditions of skin appendages">Category:Diseases and conditions of skin appendages</a>, but simply <a href="" title="Category:Conditions of the skin appendages">Category:Conditions of the skin appendages</a>.</li>
<li>Concerning the parent <a href="" title="Category:Cutaneous conditions">Category:Cutaneous conditions</a>, the term &#34;cutaneous&#34; was specifically used because, technically, the term &#34;skin&#34; in the strict sense does <i>not</i> include the adnexa (i.e. hair, nails, glands).  Additionally, some people do not even consider the subcutaneous tissues part of the &#34;skin.&#34;  Therefore, to provide a broader parent category to include all these things, the less specific term &#34;cutaneous&#34; was used, this with the less specific &#34;conditions&#34; in order to, again, include disease articles with some normal variants under the same category.</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li>I hope I have not stepped on any toes here, and welcome any additional comments.  Thanks again for your help! <a href="" title="User:Kilbad">kilbad</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kilbad">talk</a>) 03:04, 11 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Sorry not to respond sooner. Thanks for your persuasive explanation regarding &#34;cutaneous&#34; vs. &#34;skin&#34;.

<li><b>Rename</b> to <a href="" title="Category:Diseases and conditions of skin appendages">Category:Diseases and conditions of skin appendages</a> per Cgingold. I think it would be confusing to rename it to just &#34;conditions&#34;, because we can&#39;t assume that everyone knows that &#34;conditions&#34; is a broad medical term that by implication encompasses diseases. If the vast majority of the articles in the category will be diseases, it makes sense to include &#34;diseases&#34; in the name. Plus it will sort of mirror <a href="" title="Category:Diseases and disorders">Category:Diseases and disorders</a>. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 21:58, 13 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>Well, I am not opposed to this name, but perhaps we could have more editors look at this to get a greater consensus on the issue of &#34;conditions&#34; and &#34;diseases&#34; with respect to category names?

No phrase can perfectly meet every goal, but I think the proposal provides the best possible combination of being precise and being concise. --<a href="" title="User:Arcadian">Arcadian</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Arcadian">talk</a>) 06:19, 15 January 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>The word diseases is unsatisfactory if the category also covers conditions. Being of the school that sees some diseases as possible adaptations and that believes genetic diversity is essential I&#39;m a bit reluctant to use &#34;disease&#34; but am happy in this context for the renaming proposed.<a href="" title="User:Mccready">Mccready</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Mccready">talk</a>) 07:14, 16 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>I understand what you&#39;re driving at, but I hope you&#39;re not seriously suggesting that the term &#34;disease&#34; be eliminated from Wiki category names. After all, many things can be considered <i>both</i> diseases and adaptations -- <a href="" title="Sickle-cell disease">Sickle-cell disease</a> being a prime example. In any event, my suggestion is to incorporate both terms in the name of the category, in order to indicate more clearly that the entire range is included. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 09:45, 16 January 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Perhaps I&#39;m not understanding properly. I thought a &#34;disease&#34; could be seen as a sub-type of &#34;condition&#34;? Not all conditions are diseases, but all diseases are conditions—No? If I&#39;m right-thinking about this, then why is saying &#34;diseases and conditions&#34; not satisfactory just because there are conditions included the category? Because the category would then include conditions and diseases. So it would seem to be a perfectly descriptive phrase in that sense. Is it because not <i>all</i> of the conditions listed are diseases? If so, I think that&#39;s a bit of a over-parsing of the category name. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 11:00, 16 January 2009 (UTC)

<dd>First, thank you again for your input, I appreciate it.  In response to your comment:

<ul>
<li>Here are several propositions I think are fair to make concerning this category: (1) there are diseases within the category, (2) there are named physical findings that may be pathologic or simply nonpathologic variants (take <a href="" title="racquet nails">racquet nails</a> or <a href="" title="melanonychia">melanonychia</a> for example, see <a href="#Conditions_of_the_skin_appendages" title="List_of_skin-related_conditions">the list</a> for more), therefore, (3) there are physical finding in the list that are not diseases.</li>
<li>With this being stated, if we agree that the term &#34;condition&#34; is less specific, and that it may include items considered &#34;diseases&#34; and those considered nonpathologic variants (based on my reasoning above (and I am not suggesting that we all necessarily agree)), then renaming to <a href="" title="Category:Conditions of the skin appendages">Category:Conditions of the skin appendages</a> would seem appropriate to me as the term &#34;conditions&#34; encompasses all the diseases and normal variants relating to the skin appendages. <a href="" title="User:Kilbad">kilbad</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kilbad">talk</a>) 20:32, 16 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>I agree that it&#39;s technically a correct term to encompass them all, but I think adding &#34;and diseases&#34; makes it somewhat  clearer to the average reader who won&#39;t know the intricate details of &#34;conditions&#34; being a term that encompasses diseases. We aren&#39;t categorizing for experts, but for regular encyclopedia users. Oops, I think I already said that above—I&#39;m just repeating what I said basically. Good to know I&#39;m interpreting things correctly, though. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 04:30, 17 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>I can&#39;t help being struck by how much this discussion parallels the discussion that resulted in the merging of <a href="" title="Category:Diseases">Category:Diseases</a> into <a href="" title="Category:Diseases and disorders">Category:Diseases and disorders</a>. Even though the term &#34;diseases&#34; does encompass <i>disorders</i>, the prevailing view was that both terms should be used in the category name because the words are construed variably by different readers/editors -- which is precisely why it would be good to do the same here. Having said that, I&#39;m now wondering whether the word &#34;conditions&#34; should somehow be incorporated in the name of the super-category, <a href="" title="Category:Diseases and disorders">Category:Diseases and disorders</a>. We don&#39;t have to decide that here (nor should we), but as long as we&#39;ve come this far, I&#39;d like to throw that out for discussion as well. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 12:27, 17 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>I agree, and as far as the items being considered for this category, there are no <i>exclusively</i> nonpathologic items being included, only (1) frank diseases and (2) conditions that can be considered pathologic or, occasionally, nonpathologic (but because they can be pathologic at times, it seems reasonable to include them in this category, and under the parent <a href="" title="Category:Diseases and disorders">Category:Diseases and disorders</a>). <a href="" title="User:Kilbad">kilbad</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kilbad">talk</a>) 22:11, 17 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Okay, then - if I&#39;ve got this right, it sounds like you would now support <a href="" title="Category:Diseases and conditions of the skin appendages">Category:Diseases and conditions of the skin appendages</a>. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 00:55, 18 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li>No, I still favor <a href="" title="Category:Conditions of the skin appendages">Category:Conditions of the skin appendages</a> with the following rational:  </li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>I think most of us agree that the term &#34;conditions&#34; can reasonable be considered to include &#34;diseases.&#34;  Therefore, I think most of us agree that <a href="" title="Category:Conditions of the skin appendages">Category:Conditions of the skin appendages</a> <i>could</i> be considered an appropriate name for this category.  <i>However</i>, I think where some of us differ is whether the term &#34;diseases&#34; should be included based on <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a>&#39;s reasoning that:</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>&#34;<i>I agree that it&#39;s [conditions] technically a correct term to encompass them all, but I think adding &#34;and diseases&#34; makes it somewhat clearer to the average reader who won&#39;t know the intricate details of &#34;conditions&#34; being a term that encompasses diseases.</i>&#34;</li></ul></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li>However, I think this statement should be considered and discussed further.  I certainly do not want to hold-up this proposed renaming, or be argumentative, but I personally disagree that adding diseases necessarily makes this category &#34;clearer&#34; to the average reader.  My <i>opinion</i> is that <a href="" title="Category:Conditions of the skin appendages">Category:Conditions of the skin appendages</a> is clear, concise, and precise, even for the &#34;average&#34; reader.  Additionally, if there is concern that the term &#34;condition&#34; is too hard for the average user to understand, can&#39;t we simply add a nice discussion of the term in an intro paragraph on the category&#39;s page? <a href="" title="User:Kilbad">kilbad</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kilbad">talk</a>) 02:09, 18 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Part of what concerns me is the issue of consistency in the names of these many sub-categories. Do you think it would be helpful to change the name of the super-category (and most or all of the other sub-cats) to incorporate the term &#34;conditions&#34;? (i.e. the super-cat might be changed to <a href="" title="Category:Diseases, disorders, and conditions">Category:Diseases, disorders, and conditions</a> or, alternatively, <a href="" title="Category:Medical conditions">Category:Medical conditions</a>) . <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 21:08, 18 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Regarding the super-category, perhaps you can start a discussion at <a href="" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine">Wikipedia:WikiProject Medicine</a> and see what people think. <a href="" title="User:Kilbad">kilbad</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kilbad">talk</a>) 14:12, 19 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>That may well be the next step, but at the moment I&#39;d really like to know what <i>your</i> views are, and how you think it relates (or doesn&#39;t) to this particular sub-category. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 22:45, 19 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

I certainly don&#39;t think the name <a href="" title="Category:Diseases, disorders, and conditions">Category:Diseases, disorders, and conditions</a> is unreasonable, but I would want to get more feedback with regard to its conciseness.  Personally, I would probably favor <a href="" title="Category:Medical conditions">Category:Medical conditions</a> over <a href="" title="Category:Diseases, disorders, and conditions">Category:Diseases, disorders, and conditions</a>, but, again, would be open to other opinions. <a href="" title="User:Kilbad">kilbad</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kilbad">talk</a>) 01:20, 20 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl><hr/>

<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b> <b>Rename</b>. I proposed this a couple of years ago with no consensus. The current naming reflects an approach to disambiguating this category (with main article <a href="" title="Monopoly">Monopoly</a>) from <a href="" title="Category:Monopoly (game)">Category:Monopoly (game)</a>. The economic concept is the source of the name of the game, and the category has a dozen or so subcategories, and well over 100 substantial articles. The game category contains 30-odd articles most of which are and can never be more than stubs. And of course, monopoly is a major social and economic concern, while the board game is a minor item in popular culture. For all these reasons, the category should simply be called Monopoly.    <a href="" title="User:John Quiggin">JQ</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:John Quiggin">talk</a>) 07:04, 10 January 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd><i>The result of the discussion was:</i>  <b>rename</b> mainly for consistency. I&#39;m torn on the arguments about &#34;United States federal elections&#34;.

<ul>
<li><b>Rename</b> All to &#39;United States federal elections in foo&#39;.  This pattern matches the parent category and leaves no question as to the category contents.  Then also rename the rest of the sister categories to match this pattern. <a href="" title="User:Hmains">Hmains</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hmains">talk</a>) 17:52, 10 January 2009 (UTC)

<li>But isn&#39;t &#34;United States federal elections…&#34; unnecessary and redundant?  With the (possible) exception of the Georgia (US vs. Caucasus), &#34;Federal elections…&#34; is simple, accurate and unconfusing.—<a href="" title="User talk:Markles">Markles</a> 18:33, 10 January 2009 (UTC) </li></ul></li>
<li><b>Support</b> — &#34;Federal&#34; makes more sense than &#34;United States&#34;. It is irrelevant for the parent category to be in the name. Above all, the name should make sense. I don&#39;t know what United States election is, but I do know what a federal election is.</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> - per nom and consistency. No, &#34;United States federal elections&#34; in the parent is not redundant unless the United States is the only nation in the world that has federal elections. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 23:04, 10 January 2009 (UTC)

<li>I haven&#39;t made up my mind yet on which of the two options I support. But I don&#39;t think &#34;Federal elections in State X&#34; actually runs afoul of the &#34;stand alone rule&#34; -- which I take very seriously -- unless there is some <i>other</i> type of &#34;Federal election&#34; (that I&#39;ve never heard of) that could be held in a U.S. state. The parent cat, on the other hand, clearly <i>does</i> require the full term. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 11:35, 11 January 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>I&#39;m undecided as well, which is why I just put a comment instead of a rename or keep suggestion.  If any of the <a href="" title="Confederate States">Confederate States</a> held federal elections, then, I would strongly support the long (and somewhat redundant) version. <a href="" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Neier">talk</a>) 11:59, 11 January 2009 (UTC)

<li>That is a really excellent and fascinating question on a subject which I know little about. (It certainly isn&#39;t covered in any depth in US history courses outside of the South.) I&#39;ve just read what little there is here on Wiki, but unsurprisingly, there&#39;s no direct reference to what term may have been used. However, based on everything I do know, I would say that it is exceedingly unlikely that they ever used a term like &#34;federal elections&#34;. After all, they deliberately chose the very distinct word &#34;<i>Con</i>federate&#34; for their national government and its branches. There were only ever two elections held for the Confederate Congress, none for the presidency. Since the word &#34;federal&#34; was closely associated with the reviled government of the United States, I have to believe that use of that term was eschewed with respect to any government institution in the Confederate States. If you want to know &#34;for sure&#34;, we could try asking one of the knowledgeable editors in that area.

<li>I&#39;m no historian either; but, since I&#39;ve delved into the world of Mozambique soccer players, and Japanese soft-porn starlets for the sake of WP, I guess it would be bad to not do the same in this case. :-)  In the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_the_Confederate_States_of_America">constitution on wikisource</a>, &#34;Federal&#34; is used exactly as you would expect it to be.  Notably, the end of section 2.1: &#34;but no person of foreign birth, not a citizen of the Confederate States, shall be allowed to vote for any officer, civil or political, State or Federal.&#34;  I left a note at the Civil War task force page to ask for their participation here. <a href="" title="User:Neier">Neier</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Neier">talk</a>) 00:35, 12 January 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
