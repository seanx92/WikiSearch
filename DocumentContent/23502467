According to the <i><a href="" title="Encyclopédie">Encyclopédie</a></i>, wolf hunting squads in France typically consisted of 25-30 good sized dogs, usually grey in color with red around the eyes and jowls. The main pack would be supplemented with six or eight large <a href="" title="sighthound">sighthounds</a> and a few <a href="" title="Dogue de Bordeaux">dogues</a>. Wolf hunting sighthounds were usually separated into three categories; <i>lévriers d&#39;estric</i>, <i>lévriers compagnons</i> (or <i>lévriers de flanc</i>) and <i>lévriers de tête</i>. It was preferable to have two teams of each kind, with each team consisting of 2-3 dogs. It is specified that one can never have enough <a href="" title="bloodhound">bloodhounds</a> in a wolf hunt, as the wolf is the most challenging quarry for the hounds to track, due to its light tread leaving scant debris, and thus very little scent. This was not so serious a problem in winter, when the tracks were easier to detect in the snow. Each bloodhound group would be used alternatively throughout the hunt, in order to allow the previous team to recuperate. Because of the wolf&#39;s feeble scent, a wolf hunt would have to begin by motivating the bloodhounds with repeated caresses and the recitation in <a href="" title="old French">old French</a>; <i>&#34;va outre ribaut hau mon valet; hau lo lo lo lo, velleci, velleci aller mon petit&#34;</i>. It was preferable that the area of the hunt contained no stronger smelling animals which could distract the dogs, or that the dogs themselves were entirely specialised in hunting wolves. Once the scent had been found, the hunters would give a further recitation in order to motivate the dogs; <i>&#34;qu&#39;est-ce là mon valet, hau l&#39;ami après, vellici il dit vrai&#34;</i>. The scent was usually found at a <a href="" title="Junction (road)">crossroad</a>, where the wolf would scratch the earth or leave a scent mark. The two teams of <i>lévriers d&#39;estric</i> would be placed at separate points on the borders of the forest, where the wolf was expected to run to. The <i>lévriers compagnons</i> would be concealed on either side of the path, while the <i>lévriers de tête</i>, which were the largest and most aggressive, would initiate the chase once the wolf was sighted. The <i>lévriers de tête</i> would chase the wolf through the path and funnel it toward the other waiting <i>lévrier</i> teams. Once the wolf was apprehended, the dogs would be pulled back, and the hunters would place a wooden stick between the wolf&#39;s jaws in order to stop it injuring them or the dogs. The hunt master would then quickly dispatch the wolf by stabbing it between the shoulder blades with a dagger.&#60;ref name=&#34;diderot&#34;&#62;&#34;Chasse du Loup&#34;, <i>L&#39;Encyclopédie, Diderot et d&#39;Alembert, 1751-1780&#60;/ref&#62;</i></p>

Once the wolf was caught by the borzois, the foremost rider would dismount and quickly dispatch the wolf with a knife.

<p>In North America wolf hunting with hounds was done in the context of pest control rather than sport. <a href="" title="George Armstrong Custer">George Armstrong Custer</a> enjoyed wolf coursing with dogs, and favoured large greyhounds and staghounds.

Some <a href="" title="American bulldog">bulldog</a> blood in the dogs was considered helpful, though not essential. Roosevelt wrote that many ranchmen of <a href="" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, and <a href="" title="Montana">Montana</a> in the final decade of the 19th century managed to breed greyhound or <a href="" title="deerhound">deerhound</a> packs capable of killing wolves unassisted, if numbering in three or more. These greyhounds were usually thirty inches at the shoulder and weighed 90&#38;nbsp;lbs. These American greyhounds apparently outclassed imported Russian borzois in hunting wolves.&#60;ref name=&#34;TEDDY&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Wolf hunting with dogs became a specialised pursuit in the 1920s, with well trained and pedigreed dogs being used. Several wolfhounds were killed in wolf hunts in the warden sponsored <a href="" title="Wisconsin Conservation Department">Wisconsin Conservation Department</a> of the 1930s.

<p>Dogs typically do not readily eat wolf curée (entrails). The <i>Encyclopédie</i> specifies that the curée had to be prepared in a special way in order for the dogs to accept it. The carcass would be skinned, gutted and decapitated, with the entrails placed in an oven. After roasting, the entrails would be mixed with breadcrumbs and placed in a cauldron of boiling water. In winter, they would then be mixed with 3-4&#38;nbsp;lbs of fat, while in summer, two or three bucketloads of milk and flour was applied. After soaking, the entrails would be placed on a sheet of cloth and taken to the dogs whilst still warm.&#60;ref name=&#34;diderot&#34; /&#62;</p>

Accounts as to how wolves react to being attacked by dogs vary, though John James Audubon wrote that young wolves generally show submissive behaviour, while older wolves fight savagely.&#60;ref name=&#34;JJA&#34; /&#62; As wolves are not as fast as smaller canids such as <a href="" title="coyote">coyotes</a>, they typically run to a low place and wait for the dogs to come over from the top and fight them.&#60;ref name=&#34;lopez&#34;/&#62; Theodore Roosevelt stressed the danger cornered wolves can pose to a pack of dogs  in his <i>Hunting the Grisly and Other Sketches</i>:
