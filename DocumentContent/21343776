<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Split_of_.7B.7Bcl.7D.7D">Split of  </span></h3>
<p> 
Soon will be around 800 stubs. I would recommend splitting by region of Vietnam in categories. The regions are as follows <a href="" title="Tay Bac">Northwest</a>  <a href="" title="Dong Bac">Northeast</a>  <a href="" title="Red River Delta">Red River Delta</a>  <a href="" title="Bac Trung Bo">North Central Coast</a>  <a href="" title="Nam Trung Bo">South Central Coast</a>  <a href="" title="Tay Nguyen">Central Highlands</a>  <a href="" title="Dong Nam Bo">Southeast</a>  <a href="" title="Mekong Delta">Mekong River Delta</a></p>
<p>However I reckon it may be worth creating upmerged templates for every province of Vietnam if we are to consider the situation more long term. Sometime I&#39;ll get around to adding the communes of Vietnam which will make this split very reasonable. I propose creating the following templates and upmerging to the new regional splits. So for example CauMau-geo-stub would feed into  .<a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 21:19, 25 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>Sure, I&#39;m certain the others will have no objection.

<p>If you want to go ahead and create the category if you intend to ensure there are at least 60 asap then I have no objections either.

<p> 
Hi, requesting category for currently-upmerged stub   as it now contains 60 articles. Not sure what the standard naming is, but recommend avoiding &#34;LGBT people stubs&#34; as the stub&#39;s scope does include people who are not lesbian/gay but are relevent in other ways. (maybe &#34;LGBT biographical stubs&#34; or something similar?)

<dd>I am not sure on this one. I think it might be better to create separate stubs like   and   rather than a general -bio stub.--<a href="" title="User:Thomas.macmillan">TM</a> 16:48, 19 February 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The LGBT-bio-stub already exists, it is just upmerged into LGBT-stubs category. If it does continue to exist as a stub type, moving it to its own category would help unclutter the parent category &#38; make the bio stubs easier to find. LGBT-activist-stub also already exists as a stub and category and is populated. Good idea on the writer stub, I didn&#39;t realize how many there were (26 writer stubs within the 60 bio stubs). I went through LGBT-bio-stubs &#38; the break-down is:
<ul>
<li>Writers of LGBT topics/themes: 26 stubs</li>
<li>LGBT-history related bio stubs (bio stubs with historical significance which do not fall under &#34;writer&#34; or &#34;activist&#34; qualifiers, including also victims of hate crimes): 18 stubs</li>
<li>Other -- Artists: only 7, Film-related bio: only 2, Music artsts: only 3, TV-related: only 1</li></ul></dd>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;d definitely support the original proposal. There were 53 such stubs two days ago and the number is increasing daily. If not for my recent health problems I&#39;d have probably proposed this myself by now. Though I can see the reasoning behind Thomas&#39;s counterproposal, I think that a basic LGBT bio category makes sense as an initial move to empty out the LGBT stub category. It would also be a reasonable parent type for the existing activist category. The idea of creating a separate template for writers has its merits, though that&#39;s perhaps less urgent.  <a href="" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i>&#60;small&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#008822&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Grutness">wha?</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/small&#62;</i> 22:48, 19 February 2009 (UTC) </li></ul>

Disambiguation of, part two. (<a href="#Cat:Diving_stubs_and_Cat:Diving_biography_stubs" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject_Stub_sorting/Proposals/Archive/December_2008">Part one was in December.</a>)</p>
<p>Diving stubs have been re-tagged with one of four templates, as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li> : 129 stubs
<ul>
<li> : 20 stubs</li></ul></li>
<li> : 1 stub
<ul>
<li> : 290 stubs</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>If I recall the threshold guidelines correctly, that means that Underwater-diving-stub and Acrobatics-diving-bio-stub qualify for their own categories, Underwater-diving-bio-stub should be upmerged, and Acrobatics-diving-stub... I don&#39;t know: does it get a category in order to hold the bio subcat, or does it just get bypassed?</p>
<p>The other question to be settled before proceeding is: Does either type of stub get to keep the existing   and  , or do we mark those as ambiguous and create new categories for both of the precise types? —<a href="" title="User:Paul A">Paul A</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Paul A">talk</a>) 01:32, 10 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Mmmmm. That&#39;s a tricky one. I&#39;d be loath to split them much more than that, or upmerge, for that matter, given the numbers involved. The best thing might to have the diving bio stubs populating two categories each, giving:
<ul>
<li>  (no stubs, three subcategories - &#34;parent only&#34; type)
<ul>
<li>  (149 stubs, fed by both the base and bio stubs)</li>
<li>  (291 stubs, fed by both the base and bio stubs)</li>
<li>  (310 stubs, fed by both bio types, as per current use)</li></ul></li></ul></dd>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="New_regional_geo_templates_for_Mali">New regional geo templates for Mali</span></h3>
<p> 
I&#39;m currently adding the 703 communes of Mali. With some seperate towns and villages it will soon be around 1000+. 
It is an early stage given that we only have around 200 Mali stubs at present but I can assure you that it will need to be done eventually and within a week or two. I propose the creation of the following templates by <a href="" title="Regions of Mali">Regions of Mali</a> -they will all expect Bamako be viable for seperate categories as I work through them. At present I believe the only one viable for category is the Kayes region.</p>
<p>Proposal:</p>

<li> </li>
<li>  100+ stubs already cat??  </li>
<li>    -this is around *60* but there is still a lag of about 35. Should be nearer 80 in an hour or two..</li>
<li> </li>
<li> </li>

<li>  -for articles on places and suburns of the city district.</li></ul>

<dd>support templates with the following changes GaoML - there is apparently a Geo district in Burkina Faso, KayesML - there is a Kayes in Congo and SégouML - there is a village in Togo.

<p>Ah yes of course, thanks for the note. Actually I think we can get away with them blank though. You see Kayes is only a small town in Congo, it will never get to the stage where we would need stub templates. Kayes in Mali is a region, cercle, commune and town. Also &#34;Geo&#34; district is also a different spelling and is a smaller disrtrict that is also unlikely to have a template created for it. Segou is only a village in TOgo whereas it is a region, cercle, commune and city. The region is probably the size of England at least. If you look on a world map you&#39;ll see these names have priority. There shouldn&#39;t be any problems without the ML, if in the unlikely event that conflicting tmeplates needed to be made in the future then we can always add an abbreviation after the new ones.  <a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 12:25, 9 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>thanks for that, I am happy that Segou and Kayes probably don&#39;t need disambig (we don&#39;t have templates for american towns of the same size) and the &#34;Geo&#34; was a misspelling on my part according to <a href="" title="Gao (disambiguation)">Gao (disambiguation)</a> but seen as we don&#39;t even have an article yet I&#39;m sure a template is many years off unless someone does a good going over of Burkina Faso. <a href="" title="User:Waacstats">Waacstats</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Waacstats">talk</a>) 14:03, 9 February 2009 (UTC)</dd>

Category is oversized, I see two options one is to split out E/W Germany with
</p>
<ul>
<li>  -  </li>
<li>  -  </li></ul>
<p>or to split by sport as we have with the US where the following would all be viable

<dd>I&#39;m not sure what is standard naming practice with these, but   (e.g., Germany-Olympic-swimming-medallist-stub}} would flow better, IMO (and yes, for continental Europe we&#39;d normally use UK spelling, so they should all be &#34;medallist&#34;. This, however, probably needs to wait for the outcome of a massive renaming of permcats which i think may be called for, so going with one -l- for now but keeping an eye out for future changes is possibly the best option). <a href="" title="User:Grutness">Grutness</a>...<i>&#60;small&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#008822&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Grutness">wha?</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/small&#62;</i> 00:58, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>If we go with the Foo-Olympic-bar then the US subcats (the only other country we have split this way) need to be renamed.  I agree that we probably do need a rename to medallist at some point.  I don&#39;t think we need both axis of split do you have a preference for either. <a href="" title="User:Waacstats">Waacstats</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Waacstats">talk</a>) 08:56, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm yes the naming does seem a bit of a mouthful. I support though based on numbers <a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 13:35, 5 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Hi. Sorry about the delay in responding fellas. I&#39;m not sure what we should do about naming in all honesty. I would completely support the category and template naming conventions above. I would also support East and West templates.<a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 18:21, 6 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
