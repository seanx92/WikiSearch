<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale: Delete</b> I have no idea what this category is supposed to contain, rather than to try and link Russia to being the Soviet Union. &#34;Post-Soviet Russia&#34; is an entity which is called the &#34;Russian Federation&#34;. Post-Soviet Russia get&#39;s around 150,000 hits on google, whereas &#34;Russian Federation&#34; gets around 70 million. The selective addition of articles into this category is obviously done on a highly POV nature. We don&#39;t have categories for Post-Soviet Estonia or Post-Soviet Ukraine, etc, we simply have categories for &#34;Estonia&#34; and &#34;Ukraine&#34;. There is no reason this should be any different. <a href="" title="User:Russavia">Russavia</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Russavia">Dialogue</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 23:44, 1 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd><b>Strong Keep</b>. The Russian Federation is, by its own request and choice, the successor state to the whole of the former Soviet Union. Therefore this category is particularly and uniquely relevant to Russia--and needs to be expanded with pointers to the appropriate set of articles. Per Russavia&#39;s Googling contention:
<ul>
<li>Russia, specifically: 295,000,000</li>
<li>Russian Federation, specifically: 61,400,000</li>
<li>Post-Soviet Russia, specifically: 324,000</li>
<li>Specific terms Post-Soviet and Russia both appearing: 582,000</li>
<li>Bolshevik Russia, specifically: 49,000</li>
<li>Bolshevist Russia, specifically: 16,200</li></ul></dd>
<dd>and let&#39;s look at one of the preeminent scholarly journal sites, <b>Jstor.org</b>, specific phrase or terms:
<ul>
<li>Russian Federation: 312</li>
<li>Post-Soviet Russia: 96</li>
<li>Terms Post-Soviet and Russia both appearing: 3,590</li>
<li>Bolshevik Russia: 53</li>
<li>Bolshevist Russia: 18</li></ul></dd>
<dd>So, the concept of &#34;Post-Soviet Russia&#34; is, per Google, more significant in non-directed searches than the term for Russia prior to becoming the Soviet Union (and as it signed as a party to treaties), and more significant with regard to scholarly articles in Jstor.org (96 versus 53 + 18 = 71). The <b>term</b>, <b>concept</b>, and <b>subject</b> are more than significant enough to merit a category. It is actually Russavia&#39;s contention which is the POV position here, that is, that today&#39;s Russia has nothing to do with the USSR and that the category exists only to flog (what &#34;highly POV nature&#34; intends in Russavia&#39;s description) the Russian Federation. I&#39;m sorry to see it more sparsely populated than it should be, since there are even books dedicated to art in post-Soviet Russia. I will certainly endeavor to improve the usefulness of this category in the future. <a href="" title="User:Vecrumba">PetersV</a> &#60;SMALL&#62;&#60;SMALL&#62;&#60;FONT STYLE=&#34;background-color:#a12830;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/FONT&#62;&#60;FONT STYLE=&#34;background-color:#ffffff;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/FONT&#62;&#60;FONT STYLE=&#34;background-color:#a12830;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/FONT&#62;&#60;/SMALL&#62; <a href="" title="User talk:Vecrumba">TALK</a>&#60;/SMALL&#62; 00:29, 2 February 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>P.S.

<p>As Biophys has just shown himself, up until 1917 it was known as the <a href="" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>. &#34;Soviet Russia&#34; was known as the <a href="" title="Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic">Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</a>. But after 1991, it is most widely known as the <a href="" title="Russian Federation">Russian Federation</a> by a long stretch on all search results which aren&#39;t limited to a single scholar storage source. The &#34;Russian Federation&#34; does not refer to <a href="" title="Rus&#39;">Rus&#39;</a>, <a href="" title="Grand Duchy of Moscow">Grand Duchy of Moscow</a>, <a href="" title="Russian Empire">Russian Empire</a>, <a href="" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> or even <a href="" title="Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic">Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</a>, but to the <a href="" title="Russian Federation">Russian Federation</a> and the Russian Federation only. There may have been a time in a brief period between 1991 and &#34;pick an arbitrary date in January 1992&#34; that Post-Soviet Russia was more common but Russian Federation is of course the most common. The category either needs to be deleted or renamed to <a href="" title="Category:Russian Federation">Category:Russian Federation</a> with very clear reasons what articles would even belongs in such a category, when they could not be categorised in Russia, which other google searches would clearly demonstrate, when Russia is mentioned they are at least 2/3 of the time referring to the &#34;Russian Federation&#34;. <a href="" title="User:Russavia">Russavia</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Russavia">Dialogue</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 02:32, 2 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Rename</b> <a href="" title="Category:Russian Federation">Category:Russian Federation</a> (currently a soft redirect to <a href="" title="Category:Russia">Category:Russia</a>) seems to be a much better choice.

<dd>I too believe that <a href="" title="Category:Russian Federation">Category:Russian Federation</a> is usable, but in what form? This is something that is going to require discussion as to what to include within that categorisation structure. It has to be something more than <i>Chechen wars</i> and <i>Federal Security Service of the Russian Federation</i> and <i>Political repression in Russia</i> obviously.

<li>Two objections. First, <a href="" title="Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic">Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic</a> was not an independent state.

<dd>And we can discuss this Biophys. As you mentioned above, you created this category to distinguish the RSFSR and the Russian Empire from <i>contemporary Russia</i>. But contemporary Russia is not known as &#34;Post-Soviet Russia&#34;, it&#39;s known as the <i>Russian Federation</i>. I&#39;ll post a message on the WP:RUSSIA talk page, as this may involve categorisation of subjects within the general scope of the project. --<a href="" title="User:Russavia">Russavia</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Russavia">Dialogue</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 17:09, 2 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<li>Withdrawing this vote of mine for reasons outlined below. &#60;s&#62;<b>Rename</b> to <a href="" title="Category:Russian Federation">Category:Russian Federation</a>.

Articles which can be unambigously categorized would go into the subcats, while something that spans the subcats can remain in the parent category.

<dl>
<dd>You would be renaming to something completely different than the intent and scope of the current category title. Scholarship on &#34;Post-Soviet Russia&#34; largely deals with facets of Russia relating to its role as successor state and how that is manifested in politics, policy, etc. The category &#34;Russian Federation&#34; can conceivably include sewer works in Minsk. All objections here appear intent on divorcing the Russian Federation from the USSR. That is not possible, Russia is its successor state. <a href="" title="User:Vecrumba">PetersV</a> &#60;SMALL&#62;&#60;SMALL&#62;&#60;FONT STYLE=&#34;background-color:#a12830;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/FONT&#62;&#60;FONT STYLE=&#34;background-color:#ffffff;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/FONT&#62;&#60;FONT STYLE=&#34;background-color:#a12830;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/FONT&#62;&#60;/SMALL&#62; <a href="" title="User talk:Vecrumba">TALK</a>&#60;/SMALL&#62; 20:55, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd><a href="" title="Category:Politics of Russia">Category:Politics of Russia</a> then is what you are talking about? Or do you mean that the category is, to paraphrase and interpret your words, a POV category in which other categories and articles are placed by some editors in order to portray a particular POV on that subject? That POV linking Russia with the Soviet Union? Then why not have a category for <a href="" title="Category:Pre-Soviet Russia">Category:Pre-Soviet Russia</a> which is of course <a href="" title="Category:Russian Empire">Category:Russian Empire</a> (etc), because after all, it is true is it not? The Russian Empire is Pre-Soviet Russia. Take off advocacy hats for this, and see that it is an unworkable category with this name, particularly as there is no scope for inclusion into the category. Take <a href="" title="History of Post-Soviet Russia">History of Post-Soviet Russia</a> which was moved to <a href="" title="History of the Russian Federation">History of the Russian Federation</a>, but of course reverted back, and it was only included in the Post-Soviet category (I added the History of Russia category), but the article itself states that it is about the &#34;Russian Federation&#34;. NPOV please people. --<a href="" title="User:Russavia">Russavia</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Russavia">Dialogue</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 21:04, 2 February 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Studying facets of Russia relating to its role as a successor state is a valid topic, yes.  However, so are the topics of post-Yeltsin Russia, post-Fidel Cuba, and of the United States after 9/11.  Should we have categories for all those things as well?  Our categorization system was not established to hair split every topic into overlapping and duplicate subcategories, it was established to help readers find articles.  <a href="" title="Category:Post-Soviet Russia">Category:Post-Soviet Russia</a> currently contains some cats and articles placed there for the only reason of the topics being covered happening after the dissolution of the USSR.  Law enforcement in Russia?  2008 amendments to the Constitution?  Terrorism in Russia?  Honestly, how exactly do these things relate to Russia&#39;s role as a successor state?  The only reason they&#39;ve been placed there is because Cat:Russian Federation is currently a soft redirect.  My suggestion would fix this unnecessary hair-splitting.  If categorization of studies of Russia&#39;s role as a successor state is the only thing that bothers you, then you should be supporting renaming Cat:Post-Soviet Russia to <a href="" title="Category:Studies of post-Soviet Russia">Category:Studies of post-Soviet Russia</a> and making that category a subcat of Cat:Russian Federation.

<li>Russavia is right here.  During the Soviet era, it was uncommon to refer to RSFSR as &#34;Russian federation&#34;.  In formal contexts, the full name would be used or acronymised, and in more informal contexts where abbreviation was appropriate, &#34;Russia&#34; (<i>Россия</i>) was by far the most common rendition.  &#34;Russian Federation&#34;, in this context, is a half-abbreviation -- not something to be used often or routinely.  Such half-abbreviations would almost always be used if, for some reason, a particular emphasis to some nuances of the concept were necessary. <a href="" title="User:Digwuren">Διγουρεν</a>&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Digwuren">Εμπρος!</a>&#60;/sub&#62; 15:07, 4 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>
<ul>
<li>There are actually two not so little problems.  As Biophys correctly pointed out, both contemporary Russia and the RSFSR can be referred to as &#34;Russian Federation&#34;.  Another thing is that contemporary Russia can be referred to as either &#34;Russia&#34; or &#34;Russian Federation&#34; (as per the <a href="" title="Constitution of Russia">Constitution of Russia</a>).  For these reasons, I have withdrawn my vote above.  After giving the situation some more thought, I would propose to <b>rename</b> this cat <a href="" title="Category:Studies of post-Soviet Russia">Category:Studies of post-Soviet Russia</a> (as per PetersV&#39;s comments) and then clean it up, removing anything that does not belong (i.e., anything that is unrelated to Russia&#39;s role as the successor of the Soviet Union).  That will leave only a handful of articles, sure, but at least the category will remain focused instead of overlapping and duplicating a good chunk of what&#39;s already in <a href="" title="Category:Russia">Category:Russia</a>.—<a href="" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#38;nbsp;•&#38;nbsp;(<a href="" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 15:02, February&#38;nbsp;3, 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<dd>I&#39;d support renaming to <a href="" title="Category:Studies of post-Soviet Russia">Category:Studies of post-Soviet Russia</a>, so long as it has a defined structure and process for inclusion of articles and categories into the category - for example, I would reject outright the inclusion of articles and categories based upon desire to portray Russia as a state with nostalgia for the USSR, or for comparison to the USSR. As I mentioned to yourself on my talk page, Russia is considered the successor of the Soviet Union on the international stage; for example, it took over the USSR&#39;s seat on the UNSC, it took over all external Soviet debt (basically leaving all 14 other countries debt free at independence), and took over all Soviet assets outside of the ex-USSR. However, other Soviet republics also consider themselves to be successors to the Soviet Union. Take for example, Ukraine, which if you look at the PD-Ukraine tags on Commons, it states that Ukraine is a successor of the USSR, and regards all pre-1954 Soviet works as being in PD, regardless of where in USSR those works were taken, and whether they may be regarded as copyrighted in Russia (which is now 1941) and overseas. Apart from the &#34;Books&#34; category (which itself needs to be looked at), what else would be included here? As KNewman states below just when does Russia stop being Post-Soviet Russia?

<dd>I&#39;m sorry, I don&#39;t follow your argument.  The term &#34;Post-Soviet Russia&#34; refers to Russia after the dissolution of the Soviet Union (1991 onward), right?  1991 onward is also the period in which the modern Russian Federation exists, right?  So, what is the difference between the modern Russian Federation and, as you put it, &#34;Russia as it exists today&#34;?  Could you, please, elaborate?  It would also be helpful to have examples of articles that would belong in <a href="" title="Category:Russian Federation">Category:Russian Federation</a> but not in <a href="" title="Category:Post-Soviet Russia">Category:Post-Soviet Russia</a> (or perhaps vice versa).

<li>Wrong.  &#34;Post-Soviet Russia&#34; does not refer to Russia in the time period that began when USSR was dissolved.  That&#39;s why we have the article <a href="" title="Russian Federation">Russian Federation</a>.  &#34;Post-Soviet Russia&#34; refers to the social, economic, and political processes that are causally traceable to Soviet Russia, and especially the events surrounding the end of the Soviet Union.  Some of events that fall into this category took place even before the USSR was formally dissolved; for example, the hyperinflation that was harbinger of the end of Soviet rule would certainly be fundamentally related to development of post-Soviet Russia.  As the transition has almost ended, I&#39;d say very few of 20th century events should be considered in this category, although the economic policy&#39;s direction towards revival of Stalin&#39;s &#34;greatness&#34; might still be relevant.</li></ul></dd>
<dd>As a rule of thumb, most of the transformative events that happened in the last few years of Gorbachev&#39;s reign, and during Yeltsin&#39;s watch, would probably be here.  Where the rule of thumb does not work, obviously, finer criteria are necessary.  But that&#39;s why Wikipedia pays the top dollars to its researchers: so they can use good judgment, and figure out where the historians draw the lines.  If it was Google, they&#39;d have a machine do the summarising job, and the machine would do a rough job at best. <a href="" title="User:Digwuren">Διγουρεν</a>&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Digwuren">Εμπρος!</a>&#60;/sub&#62; 20:41, 3 February 2009 (UTC)

<li>Thank you for the explanation.  However, it only strengthened my belief that the category should be renamed (see my changed vote from earlier today).  We can&#39;t expect our average readers to assume that &#34;Cat:Post-Soviet Russia&#34; would be the place for articles covering &#34;the social, economic, and political processes that are causally traceable to Soviet Russia, and especially the events surrounding the end of the Soviet Union&#34;.  C&#39;mon, this is obvious <i>how</i>?  If you had to explain this to me in <i>this</i> much detail (and I like to think that I am not a completely illiterate idiot, perhaps wrongly), how would it be obvious to a drive-by reader?  The term &#34;Post-Soviet Russia&#34; associates first and foremost with the modern Russian Federation, which is exactly why the contents of the category in its present form contain so much duplication with Cat:Russia.  Let&#39;s keep the cat, but change its name to something more sensible.—<a href="" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#38;nbsp;•&#38;nbsp;(<a href="" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 21:12, February&#38;nbsp;3, 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<li>You know, I only used long and complicated <a href="" title="polysyllabic">polysyllabic</a> words because I expected you to be <a href="" title="literate">literate</a>.  If I had not made that assumption, I would have dumbed the definition down to something like &#34;it is about those sides of Russia that are distinctly about the end of the Soviet era&#34;.

<dl>
<dd>The concept, by the way, is intuitively understood by all scholars I&#39;ve been discussing it with, and applies to other countries with post-Soviet aspects in their history, too.  For example, <a class="externallink" href="http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/6/8/7/2/p268729_index.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/6/8/7/2/p268729_index.html">this paper titled &#34;Post-Soviet Health Care: Russia, Poland, and Kazakhstan&#34;</a> is clearly (it says so in the abstract!) about the healthcare reforms and developments relating to the end of Soviet power in Russia, Poland and Kazakhstan, not about the whole time period from 1991 onwards. <a href="" title="User:Digwuren">Διγουρεν</a>&#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Digwuren">Εμπρος!</a>&#60;/sub&#62; 15:01, 4 February 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The fact that the concept is intuitively understood by the scholars is not a good argument in this particular discussion, however.  I would be the first one to line up defending Wikipedia from being dumbed down, and the necessary level of details should be maintained in the actual articles.  When it comes to naming the <i>categories</i>, however, the naming scheme should be as intuitive as possible to as many people as possible.  The category structure is intended first and foremost as a navigational aide, not as a thing in itself, which is why its title should not be something that can be interpreted with this level of ambiguity.—<a href="" title="User:Ezhiki">Ëzhiki (Igels Hérissonovich Ïzhakoff-Amursky)</a>&#38;nbsp;•&#38;nbsp;(<a href="" title="User talk:Ezhiki">yo?</a>); 17:17, February&#38;nbsp;4, 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Consider also <a href="" title="free market">free market</a>, <a href="" title="free trade">free trade</a>, <a href="" title="free will">free will</a>, <a href="" title="free energy">free energy</a>, etc.  These terms have significantly different meaning than the combination of their component word definitions.  --<a href="" title="User:Hamitr">Hamitr</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hamitr">talk</a>) 22:13, 2 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that a reader assuming that &#34;Free Software&#34; means free of charge is not wrong.  That jargon exists with a different meaning does not alter this. In the same sense that a reader assuming that &#34;<a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/work">work</a>&#34; means the &#34;Effort expended on a particular task.&#34; is not wrong.  Despite the fact that it has a well established meaning of force times distance.</dd>
<dd>I agree that the encyclopedia is a place to teach people.  I do not think the category space is the bast place to do so.</dd>
<dd>About being optimistic, software marketed as being free is very often in a try before you buy sort of scheme.</dd>
<dd><a href="" title="Free market">Free market</a>,<a href="" title="Free trade">Free trade</a> and <a href="" title="Free will">Free will</a> have been around for centuries.  In 2050 it might very well be that &#34;Free software&#34; is not ambiguous.</dd>
<dd>Also, in The first two cases there is little risk of confusion since gratis market or gratis trade makes very little sense.  I suppose one could interpret <a href="" title="Free will">Free will</a> to gratis will, essentially meaning something like freedom from responsibility.  But the term is older than English so it is too entrenched.</dd>
<dd><a href="" title="Free energy">Free energy</a> is a dab.  Within physics this is a piece of jargon meaning essentially available <a href="" title="energy">energy</a>.  Outside of physics I doubt anyone could be confused about the statement; &#34;The oil companies are suppressing free energy&#34;.  Or &#34;Some hailed nuclear power as a free energy source&#34;.<a href="" title="User:Taemyr">Taemyr</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Taemyr">talk</a>) 00:53, 3 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Keep</b> - not all free software is licensed.  Software whose <a href="" title="source code">source code</a> is in the <a href="" title="public domain">public domain</a> is free software but has no licence.  &#34;Free&#34; is ambiguous in theory, but looking at Wikipedia, the usage is pretty consistent. --<a href="" title="User:Gronky">Gronky</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Gronky">talk</a>) 23:21, 2 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>Some software under Open Source license is not Free Software, at least according to our article.  Also, I would be prepared to argue that the license for public domain works are the relevant laws.  In that it is these laws that grant the permission for use of the work.</dd>
<dd>I suggested <a href="" title="Category:FLOSS">Category:FLOSS</a> in response to Hamitr&#39;s concern that <a href="" title="Category:Freely licensed software">Category:Freely licensed software</a> can be seen as just as ambiguous as <a href="" title="Category:Free software">Category:Free software</a>.

<li><b>Keep</b> My &#34;KEEP&#39; is not because I think that is the right answer, it&#39;s that there is a larger context.  Consider some category, say <a href="" title="Category:Spreadsheet software">Category:Spreadsheet software</a>.  There is now a corresponding <a href="" title="Category:Free spreadsheet software">Category:Free spreadsheet software</a>, the subject of this renaming proposal.  The difficulty is that there can be articles in those two categories with various combination&#39;s of categories, such as:
<ul>
<li><a href="" title="Category:Free spreadsheet software">Category:Free spreadsheet software</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Category:Free spreadsheet software">Category:Free spreadsheet software</a> <a href="" title="Category:GNU project software">Category:GNU project software</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Category:Spreadsheet software">Category:Spreadsheet software</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Category:Spreadsheet software">Category:Spreadsheet software</a> <a href="" title="Category:Proprietary software">Category:Proprietary software</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Category:Spreadsheet software">Category:Spreadsheet software</a> <a href="" title="Category:Freeware">Category:Freeware</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Category:Spreadsheet software">Category:Spreadsheet software</a> <a href="" title="Category:Shareware">Category:Shareware</a></li>
<li><a href="" title="Category:Spreadsheet software">Category:Spreadsheet software</a> <a href="" title="Category:Public domain software">Category:Public domain software</a></li></ul></li>
<li>Can this be explained (where?) to a casual Wiki user?  Is this split useful to users?  Is it even necessary to split categories by free/not-free/..., when info blocks now make licenses explicit?  Can authors be expected to get fine points of categorizations correct?  Given info blocks, do we even need license-type categories?  Does Public domain software belong in Free software (i.e., is it wrong in the example above)?  Before renaming, we should decide on an organization which best meets user and author needs.  It may be the current organization, or not, I don&#39;t know, but having just one category, not two, &#34;Spreadsheet software&#34;, for the example above, has some appeal and doesn&#39;t need explaining. Another easy-to-explain approach would be to put only things that are free (in the common understanding) into the Free categories (Freeware, Public domain, ...). Do we know why the current split was chosen? <a href="" title="User:Rwwww">tooold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Rwwww">talk</a>) 08:56, 3 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>

<dd>We have categories for free software because the free software license is a defining feature of several works.  For example <a href="" title="OpenOffice.org Calc">OpenOffice.org Calc</a> was created to be a open source alternative to <a href="" title="OpenOffice.org Calc">OpenOffice.org Calc</a>.  Because being an open source spreadsheet is a defining feature of <a href="" title="OpenOffice.org Calc">OpenOffice.org Calc</a> categorizing it as such is appropriate according to <a href="" title="WP:Categories">WP:Categories</a>.  According to discussion at <a href="" title="Category:Free software">Category:Free software</a> we do not split between free software and open source, because the two concepts are very similar, and the dividing line can be controversial.  </dd>
<dd>My question to you is, if we categorize according into FLOSS is &#34;Free software&#34; the appropriate name of the category?  <a href="" title="User:Taemyr">Taemyr</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Taemyr">talk</a>) 17:11, 3 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale: Delete.</b> It seems that categorizing U.S. House of Representatives by the Committee they served on in Congress is overcategorization. House members can and do serve on a variety of different committees during their tentures, and serving on any particular House committee is generally not defining for the politician. There&#39;s the chance that categorizing someone into this category is just another way of saying from our perspective 50 years later, &#34;what an ass!&#34; <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 10:08, 1 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<li><b>Keep</b> - Cleary we don&#39;t want categories for ordinary committees -- but this was no ordinary committee. It was almost certainly the most famous committee in the entire history of the US Congress. Congressmen jockeyed to get a seat on the committee -- and some of its members built their political careers squarely on the basis of their service on the committee, most notably Richard Nixon. So, while the committee itself may have been &#34;POV&#34;, having a category for it would not be. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 15:11, 1 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> or <b>rename</b>.  I agree with the the nominator&#39;s rationale.  A list contained in the HUAC article should be sufficient.  This opens a can of worms (a &#34;slippery slope&#34;?) deciding which committees are prominent enough.  Clearly this is a famous committee, perhaps the most well known; but why should it be the only committee?  This is one of those instances where a list is enough.  <b>However</b>, if this category is kept, the name should be made either more accurate (&#34;Members of the United States House of Representatives Committee on Un-American Activities&#34;) or better known (&#34;Members of the House Un-American Activities Committee&#34;).—<a href="" title="User talk:Markles">Markles</a> 15:52, 1 February 2009 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Delete</b> - an argument could be made that any particular committee is &#34;one of the most notable&#34; committees in US history. Keeping this category opens the door to categories for every committee and members of Congress move from one committee to another with some frequency, which would lead to category clutter. Each Congressperson&#39;s article should contain a list of that member&#39;s committee assignments and each committee article should contain a list of committee members. If kept, rename to <a href="" title="Category House Committee on Un-American Activities members">Category House Committee on Un-American Activities members</a>. <a href="" title="User:Otto4711">Otto4711</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Otto4711">talk</a>) 20:33, 2 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - In response to Markles&#39; &#38; Otto&#39;s concerns, which (as I indicated above) I take very seriously: What I am saying is not merely that this committee was notable or famous, but that it was <i>exceptionally</i> notable, and as such, I think an <i>exception</i> to the general rule should be made for this category. Can either of you (or anybody else) point to even a single other example of a Congressional committee which aroused such strong feelings about its operations that a years-long campaign was waged to have it <i>abolished</i>? (I didn&#39;t think so.) I know of only one other committee that could even be given consideration for such an exception, and that would be the <a href="" title="United States Senate Watergate Committee">Senate Select Committee on Watergate</a>. In short, we can establish a very high threshhold to ensure that categories for committees don&#39;t proliferate. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 21:24, 2 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>I agree that there is a clear difference between this committee and others. What makes this so problematic is that despite the extensive number of articles and books written about the HUAC, and the pivotal role it played in the McCarthy Era, all any editor has to do to play the CfD game is just insist that it isn&#39;t, along with the foot stamping insistence that this will lead to a dreaded slippery slope that won&#39;t stop until all articles are categorized by useful and defining characteristics they just don&#39;t want. For individuals who want to make categories a useful means of navigation for similar articles, this is a perfect one for retention. For those whose IHATEIT game allows them to turn their nose at what they don&#39;t like (while approving far less useful or defining categories that pass their arbitrary test), there is no reason that can&#39;t be tossed out as a rationalization for deletion. <a href="" title="User:Alansohn">Alansohn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Alansohn">talk</a>) 01:56, 3 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li><b>Comment</b>. Reading some of the comments, it seems to me that we are conflating issues here. The fact that HUAC was a very prominent and exceptionally famous committee is one issue that is not really in question here. What <i>is</i> in question is whether membership in the committee is defining for a Congressperson. They are very different issues. Off the top of your head, can any editor name one or more of the 9 chairs of the committee? I&#39;m not aware of any politician who is defined by his membership in HUAC. Nixon undoubtedly is the most famous, but he&#39;s not really defined by having been in HUAC. The next most prominent person who others <i>might</i> associate with HUAC is Joseph McCarthy—who, of course, was a Senator and was never a member of HUAC. I knew a bit about <a href="" title="Richard B. Vail">Richard B. Vail</a> before coming to this discussion, and I can&#39;t say that membership in HUAC was at or near the top of my list for things he was known for. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 20:29, 3 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> parlimentarians by committees, subcommittees, etc. is a bad idea. The partial list in the article could be expanded (and as an aside, &#34;notable members&#34; as the section is called is improperly labelled: presumably all members of the US House of Representatives are <a href="" title="WP:N">notable</a>). <a href="" title="User:Carlossuarez46">Carlossuarez46</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Carlossuarez46">talk</a>) 02:15, 4 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I believe HUAC is better understood as an investigative body, like a semi-perpetual version of the <a href="" title="Cox Report">Cox Committee</a> or the <a href="" title="Iraq Study Group">Iraq Study Group</a>, and not dismissed as if it were Agriculture or Ways and Means. Perhaps, then, the contents should be upmerged into <a href="" title="Category:House Un-American Activities Committee">Category:House Un-American Activities Committee</a> to parallel <a href="" title="Category:9/11 Commission">Category:9/11 Commission</a> and <a href="" title="Category:Warren Commission">Category:Warren Commission</a>. Membership on those bodies were not defining, but membership on a blue-ribbon panel will not be, essentially by definition. On the other hand, these two categories are quite thin, with only a couple of articles not about members; HUAC material is thinner still. For all the discussion of how important and historic HUAC was, there seems to be little content on its activities in WP itself, much less on its members&#39; participation in those activities.-<a href="" title="User:Choster">choster</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Choster">talk</a>) 09:39, 4 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>Those are interesting comparisons; I for one would not consider membership in the Warren Commission defining of either Earl Warren or Gerald Ford certainly.

<li>Membership in those (and other) commissions are fairly static whereas HUAC lasted many decades and its membership fluctuated over time.  I suggest, again I think, that this subject doesn&#39;t really need a category.—<a href="" title="User talk:Markles">Markles</a> 13:39, 5 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li><b>Delete</b>, mostly per Markles and Otto. While the committe was exceptionally notable and its members also were notable, it is not apparent that participation in HCUA was &#60;u&#62;defining&#60;/u&#62; for its members. Since we are, in this case, discussing categorization of biographies, we should focus on the significance of individuals&#39; <i>affiliation with HCUA</i> rather than the general significance of HCUA in American political history. Also, since HCUA lasted for 3–4 decades (and had many, many members), I don&#39;t think that a comparison to <a href="" title="Category:Warren Commission">Category:Warren Commission</a> is justified. A category for HCUA should be created if there is a sufficient quantity of non-biographical articles related to the subject, but such a category should not function as a repository for biographical articles about HCUA&#39;s members. –<b><a href="" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a></b> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Black Falcon">Talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 21:37, 13 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd><b>Nominator&#39;s rationale:</b> Categories are not conventionally split between current and former.  This category appears so far to be populated with people who resigned from the Labour Party but remained active in politics. Most of these politicians are already heavily categorised, and this category adds little to the readers navigation aids that is not already covered by other categories or lists. <a href="" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#996600; cursor: not-allowed;&#34;&#62;Brown&#60;/span&#62;HairedGirl</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 01:45, 1 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<li><b>Rename</b> rather than delete. The category should not be read as &#34;former politicians,&#34; but as &#34;former Labourites.&#34; <a href="" title="Clare Short">Clare Short</a>, <a href="" title="Roy Jenkins">Roy Jenkins</a>, and so on left the Labour Party for others, and in an electoral democracy changing party affiliation is a significant event in a politician&#39;s career, especially for legislators. At least, it is more defining than <a href="" title="Category:Religious converts">Category:Religious converts</a> which has survived past CfD. What this category lacks is an unambiguous name and a parent to tie it to <a href="" title="Category:Canadian MPs who have crossed the floor">Category:Canadian MPs who have crossed the floor</a> and all the other politicians of various systems who have <a href="" title="floor crossing (South Africa)">floor crossed</a>, <a href="" title="crossing the floor">crossed the floor</a>, <a href="" title="aisle (political term)">crossed the aisle</a>, or otherwise <a href="" title="party switching">switched parties</a>, or who have left all parties and continue their careers as independents.-<a href="" title="User:Choster">choster</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Choster">talk</a>) 03:24, 1 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> rather than delete, per Choster.  Perhaps <a href="" title="Category:Labour Party politicians (UK) who joined another party">Category:Labour Party politicians (UK) who joined another party</a> - although perhaps some became Independents. Or <a href="" title="Category:UK politicians who left the Labour Party during their careers">Category:UK politicians who left the Labour Party during their careers</a> - we don&#39;t want ones who were members as students etc. <a href="" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Johnbod">talk</a>) 04:12, 1 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. <i>If</i> this category is to be kept (and I&#39;d prefer it was deleted), then it would be best to follow the namimg of the existing <a href="" title="List of British Members of Parliament who crossed the floor">List of British Members of Parliament who crossed the floor</a>, i.e. use &#34;crossed the floor&#34; and restrict it to MPs.  However, before deciding to keep a renamed category, may I suggest that editors take a careful look at <a href="" title="List of British Members of Parliament who crossed the floor">List of British Members of Parliament who crossed the floor</a>, because it seems to me that the list throws up difficulties wrt inclusion criteria.  Obviously, there&#39;s little doubt about the likes of <a href="" title="Roy Jenkins">Roy Jenkins</a>, <a href="" title="Shaun Woodward">Shaun Woodward</a> and <a href="" title="Reg Prentice">Reg Prentice</a> (or the three-party man <a href="" title="John Horam">John Horam</a>), but what about those such as <a href="" title="Ann Winterton">Ann Winterton</a> and  <a href="" title="Andrew Pelling">Andrew Pelling</a>, both who lost the whip briefly and sat as independents until it was restored.  Then there are others like <a href="" title="Ken Livingstone">Ken Livingstone</a> and <a href="" title="Clare Short">Clare Short</a>, who left their party to sit as independents.  And what about <a href="" title="Roger Knapman">Roger Knapman</a> and others who switched party after leaving Westminster?  It seems to me that this territory can be much more effectively encompassed by a list, which can be (and with MPs already is) annotated to clarify the very different circumstances and variable permanence of the changes of party label. Can anyone suggest a category definiton which is both clear and non-arbitrary? --<a href="" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#996600; cursor: not-allowed;&#34;&#62;Brown&#60;/span&#62;HairedGirl</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 04:58, 1 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Delete</b> and listify for reasons given by nominator in the original nomination statement and immediately above. I think this material, while useful, is not easily amenable to categorization, or at least a list will be far more effective in explaining what it means in each individual case. <a href="" title="User:Good Olfactory">Good Ol’factory</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Good Olfactory">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 06:37, 1 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Rename</b> -- to <a href="" title="Category:British members of Parliament who changed party">Category:British members of Parliament who changed party</a> (or crossed the floor).  In modern British politics this is a sufficiantly rare phenomenon not to need division by former party.  The category may need to be defined more precisely in a short description on the category page, so that (1) politicians before the era of heavily-whipped parties are not included; (2) those to lost the whip, but did not join another political party, are excluded.  Furthermore, this category should not include members of the House of Lords (where former party politicians may prefer to sit there as crossbenchers); local politicians (where changing party may be less significant); those who leave a major political party and form their own.  <a href="" title="User:Peterkingiron">Peterkingiron</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Peterkingiron">talk</a>) 14:30, 1 February 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. <a href="" title="Category:British members of Parliament who changed party">Category:British members of Parliament who changed party</a> is a bad choice of name: a) &#34;Members of Parliament&#34; should be capitalised, b) it is not the &#34;British Parliament&#34; but the &#34;Parliament of the United Kingdom&#34; (which includes Great Britain and Northern Ireland).  If this type of renaming is to be adopted, the name should follow the format of other similar sub-categories of  , and be called <a href="" title="Category:Members of the United Kingdom Parliament who changed party">Category:Members of the United Kingdom Parliament who changed party</a>.  But before keeping this category, please look at the effect this category will have on the article <a href="" title="Winston Churchill">Winston Churchill</a>. --<a href="" title="User:BrownHairedGirl">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#996600; cursor: not-allowed;&#34;&#62;Brown&#60;/span&#62;HairedGirl</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:BrownHairedGirl">(talk)</a> • (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/BrownHairedGirl">contribs</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 03:35, 2 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>. Not all of the people in the category are or were MPs; for example, <a href="" title="Peggy Duff">Peggy Duff</a> and <a href="" title="Peter Tatchell">Peter Tatchell</a>. –<b><a href="" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a></b> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Black Falcon">Talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 20:38, 13 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> – If the consensus is to not keep this categorization, then the category probably should be merged to <a href="" title="Category:Labour Party politicians (UK)">Category:Labour Party politicians (UK)</a> rather than deleted. Straight deletion would leave a few of the articles outside of the <a href="" title="Category:Labour Party (UK)">Labour Party (UK)</a> category tree.&#60;br /&#62;I am against categorizing on the basis of current/former affiliations in general, so I oppose renaming to any title that indicates former affiliation with the Labour Party (e.g. <i>Category:Labour MPs (UK) who crossed the floor</i>). While <a href="" title="Category:Members of the United Kingdom Parliament who crossed the floor">Category:Members of the United Kingdom Parliament who crossed the floor</a> reflects what I consider to be a defining (i.e. categorization-worthy) characteristic, such a category would be problematic for reasons noted above. The main question for me would be: Do we count MPs who left a party to become independents as having crossed the floor? –<b><a href="" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a></b> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Black Falcon">Talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 21:19, 13 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b>.  IMHO, they should be in a category for each party they&#39;ve been a member of - or at least that they&#39;ve been a politician for.  Perhaps there could also be a category for people who&#39;ve switched parties though.  --<i><a href="" title="User:Philosopher">Philosopher</a></i>&#38;nbsp;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Philosopher">Let us reason together.</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 14:19, 16 February 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li><b>Oppose Merging</b> - Although superficially similar, these are actually based on quite distinct organizing principles. We all understand what&#39;s meant by &#34;topic&#34;, so no need to elaborate. The problem, of course, is that &#34;by interest&#34; is not so readily understood (in fact, I would definitely support renaming, if a better name can be found). &#34;Interest&#34; seems to translate to something like &#34;of interest to people of a particular group or orientation&#34; (or something to that effect). So, for example, <i>Women&#39;s magazines</i> are not <i>about</i> women -- rather, they are magazines which focus on topics that are of interest to women. <i>Fashion magazines</i>, on the other hand, are rightly included under Publications by topic. That said, it does look like there are some items that don&#39;t really belong under <a href="" title="Category:Publications by interest">Category:Publications by interest</a>, like Criminology, Energy, and Military publications. So some cleanup is in order. And a more readily understood name would really help -- or at least, a clear explanatory note for users. <a href="" title="User:Cgingold">Cgingold</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cgingold">talk</a>) 08:55, 1 February 2009 (UTC)</li>
