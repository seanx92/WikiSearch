<p>The reasons for obesity of cats and dogs in wealthier countries is dogs over eating. The wealthy families give their pets what ever they want to eat.  Lifestyle influences take a great part in the cats and dogs over eating habits. In modern times, pets are often, for their own safety, not allowed to free roam as they did in the past. This owner feels as though they should repay their pets with treats, which contributes to their overeating habits.  Modern day <a href="" title="pet food">pet foods</a> are a higher quality food, and dogs, as natural scavengers, are prone to gorging themselves whenever the opportunity arises, with the limit being stomach capacity rather than hunger level. In evolutionary past, this was the only way to survive as they wouldn&#39;t know where their next meal would be coming from. More recently, pet and working dogs were fed on scraps of whatever was left over. Modern food, developed specifically for dogs, are nutritious. However, owners are prone to overfeeding dogs, as they see the bowl of food and think that it looks like not enough. The taste of <a href="" title="dog food">dog food</a> encourages dogs to want to feed more.</p>
<p>Modern lifestyles often mean that owners are not able to walk their dog for an hour or more a day, thus reduced exercise, coupled with richer foods and owners who believe that they are doing the right thing by overfeeding, are the main cause of obesity illness in pets today. </p>
<p>A common misconception is that <a href="" title="neutering">surgical sterilization of animals</a> increases the chances of the pet becoming overweight.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="" title="Association for Pet Obesity Prevention">Association for Pet Obesity Prevention</a>, 53% of adult dogs and 55% of adult cats are overweight or obese.&#60;ref name=&#34;today&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; National Pet Wellness Month is October and National Pet Obesity Awareness Day is October 10.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
