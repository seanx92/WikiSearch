The Portuguese Water Dog is a fairly rare breed; only 48 Portuguese Water Dogs were entered for Britain&#39;s <a href="" title="Crufts">Crufts</a> competition in 2009&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; and the author of <i>The New Complete Portuguese Water Dog,</i> Kitty Braund, believes there are about 50,000 in North America.&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Due to its fleecy coat, the Portuguese Water Dog is considered a <a href="" title="hypoallergenic dog breed">hypoallergenic dog breed</a>.</p>

<p>At his first press conference as <a href="" title="President-elect">President-elect</a>, Obama was questioned by reporters as to which breed the family was looking to acquire; he replied, &#34;Our preference would be to get a shelter dog, but, obviously, a lot of shelter dogs are <a href="" title="Mixed-breed dog">mutts</a>.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;politicalintelligence1&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; He also noted &#34;Malia is allergic, so it has to be hypoallergenic. There are a number of breeds that are hypoallergenic.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;politicalintelligence1&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p><a href="" title="George Stephanopolous">George Stephanopolous</a> asked Obama on television in early January what kind of dog they would get, and when, saying that he was passing on a question from Obama&#39;s daughters who were sitting in the control room. Obama said, &#34;They seem to have narrowed it down to a <a href="" title="labradoodle">labradoodle</a> or a <a href="" title="Portuguese water dog">Portuguese water hound</a> ... medium-sized dog, and so, we&#39;re now going to start looking at <a href="" title="animal shelter">shelters</a> to see when one of those dogs might come up.&#34;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Much was made by the public and press about the family&#39;s search for a dog. On April 12, 2009, it was announced that the Obamas would soon accept a six-month-old Portuguese Water Dog puppy as a gift from Senator Kennedy. The dog was reported to have visited the family some weeks earlier&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; in a secret meeting to gauge compatibility and purportedly referred to by staffers as &#34;The Meeting&#34;. However, the gift was not accepted until the dog officially arrived and moved in at the <a href="" title="White House">White House</a> on Tuesday, April 14, 2009;&#60;ref name=&#34;yahoo1&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; Immediately after he arrived, the family staged a <a href="" title="photo op">photo op</a> with Bo on the property&#39;s <a href="" title="South Lawn (White House)">South Lawn</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;huff&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; At the conference, Obama was asked if he would allow Bo inside the <a href="" title="Oval Office">Oval Office</a>, to which he responded: &#34;of course.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;huff&#34; /&#62; He also gave a nod to President <a href="" title="Harry Truman">Harry Truman</a>&#39;s quote, &#34;If you want a friend in Washington, get a dog.&#34;&#60;ref name=&#34;huff&#34; /&#62; The White House website was later updated to include official pictures and biographical details of Bo.&#60;ref name=&#34;fd-three&#34; /&#62;</p>

<p>In June 2009, the White House released a baseball card for Bo with his new official portrait on one side and tongue-in-cheek statistics on the other; information included the facts that Bo&#39;s favorite food is tomatoes and that he does not yet know how to swim. The card is available by sending a self-addressed, stamped envelope to the White House.&#60;ref name=&#34;baseball&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;</p>

<p>In December 2010, Bo was permitted to accompany the Obama family to the guest house <a href="" title="Plantation Estate">Plantation Estate</a> in Hawaii.

<p>As Bo is a gift from the Kennedy family, he is not a shelter dog. Some dog experts, such as <a href="" title="Cesar Millan">Cesar Millan</a>, state that Bo could be considered part of a larger group known as rescue dogs, as he was unsuccessful in his first home, when plans for him to provide companionship to an older female dog went awry because he irritated the dog through attempts to <a href="" title="Breastfeeding">suckle</a>.&#60;ref name=&#34;yahoo1&#34;/&#62;&#60;ref&#62; &#60;/ref&#62; The Obamas have pledged to donate to the <a href="" title="District of Columbia">District of Columbia</a> Humane Society to show their support for shelter dogs.&#60;ref&#62;   &#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>Some criticism has arisen from <a href="" title="animal welfare">animal welfare</a> supporters because Bo was not adopted from a shelter.&#60;ref name=&#34;latimes&#34; /&#62; The <a href="" title="Humane Society of the United States">Humane Society of the United States</a> released a statement on their website thanking the Obamas &#34;for taking in a second-chance dog,&#34; but also encouraged the public to avoid going through breeders.&#60;ref name=&#34;humane&#34;&#62; &#60;/ref&#62;
