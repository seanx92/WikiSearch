<dd>Looking at a couple of the articles, they were almost word for word from the originals, with a few words changed - that doesn&#39;t make them different enough from the original to be considered kosher, far as I&#39;m aware. I&#39;d suggest restarting, using those Canadian government pages as one source, and find some others to work from, then rewrite them entirely in your own words in userspace. Other than that, you&#39;d be better off going to <a href="" title="WP:DRV">deletion review</a>. <a href="" title="User:Tony Fox">Tony Fox</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Tony Fox">(arf!)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 06:23, 14 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Ed I 100% agree that an RFC is called for regarding these links.  I 100% agree with other dispute resolution being used for those links.  The vandalism warning had nothing do with those links (see the diff above).  This is sineed (deliberately?) conflating two issues to strengthen his complaint.  I want an RFC, since I think this is a more general problem.  As I indicated on the talk pages.  </dd>
<dd>The material that was deleted had references to all the principle parties and meets <a href="" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>.  It had <b>absolutely nothing</b> to do with those links.  What it was however was reliable sourced information about SGM that shows misconduct as verified by an independent 3rd party (Christian Research Institute) and a knowledge 3rd party (Growing Families Internation).  A policy that (sinneed and?) FenderPriest would rather not have discussed.  In other words this is not a debate about <a href="" title="WP:EL">WP:EL</a> at all, there are no external links in the material deleted, with the exception of the personal blog of the woman who is being discussed at length (a first party EL).

<dd>After seeing the page, it looks like a bad idea.

<dd>(ec) Clarification, NH: pages like that are acceptable in userspace if (and only if) they are being used as a sandbox for drafting an RFC/U, RFAR, etc. And even under those limited circumstances, the actual RFX needs to be posted within a reasonable amount of time. This use of userspace meets none of those conditions. Also, I have notified the user of this thread. There is also an odd accusation of sockpuppetry on the user&#39;s talkpage, which might be worth looking into given the apparent subject area interest. //<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#082567;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>roux</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #082567;-moz-border-radius-topright:10px;-moz-border-radius-bottomleft:10px;padding:0px 7px;font-size:30%;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a> 02:37, 16 March 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;

</p>
<ul>
<li>a caution not to use warnings for 1st removal of content added without consenesus in a highly contentious article - this is incivil and abusive of editing privilege</li>

<dd>(ec) Clarification, NH: pages like that are acceptable in userspace if (and only if) they are being used as a sandbox for drafting an RFC/U, RFAR, etc. And even under those limited circumstances, the actual RFX needs to be posted within a reasonable amount of time. This use of userspace meets none of those conditions. Also, I have notified the user of this thread. There is also an odd accusation of sockpuppetry on the user&#39;s talkpage, which might be worth looking into given the apparent subject area interest. //<a href="" title="User:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#082567;font-size:80%;&#34;&#62;<b>roux</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Roux">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #082567;-moz-border-radius-topright:10px;-moz-border-radius-bottomleft:10px;padding:0px 7px;font-size:30%;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</a> 02:37, 16 March 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;

Nonracist uncivil jerks deserve to be treated the same way.  Look into it but frankly, he&#39;s not exactly subtle and we&#39;ll catch him when he starts again.

<dd>Really?! One was the complete replacement of a notable Dave Atkins with a different Dave Atkins (leaving various football related articles with links to a musician) when a disambig page is the best way forwards.  The other was effective move of a notable album to an incorrect title and the setting up of an implausible redirect.  I disagree that these two edits were made in good faith.  I addition the same user has created several articles about bands which have been speedily deleted (or moved to user subpages or project subpages).

It was easier to create <a href="" title="Dave Atkins (NFL coach)">Dave Atkins (NFL coach)</a> and fixup the smaller number of links (and fixed a couple that should have pointed to <a href="" title="Dave Atkins (actor)">Dave Atkins (actor)</a>).    <a href="" title="User:Astronaut">Astronaut</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Astronaut">talk</a>) 21:46, 20 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>  is currently the subject of a <a href="" title="WP:RFAR">Request for arbitration</a> after a <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for comment/Aitias">RFC</a> failed to modify poor behavior.

He also indefinitely fully-protected his userpage, to which I reverted because there was no justification or rationale. Just a few minutes ago, Aitias sought <a href="" title="WP:RTV">right-to-vanish</a> by deleting his talk page, however, it is not encouraged and can be overturned by community consensus -- which I am seeking.</p>
<p>As Aitias is the subject of a RFAR, and a former RFC, and has not yet given up the bit, his talk pages should be undeleted for the community to review. His comments on his talk page are linked to the RFAR, and should remain open to everyone. &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User:Seicer">&#60;font color=&#34;#CC0000&#34;&#62;seicer&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#38;#x007C; <a href="" title="User_talk:Seicer">&#60;font color=&#34;#669900&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#38;#x007C; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">&#60;font color=&#34;#669900&#34;&#62;contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/small&#62; 13:45, 16 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Yes, and I noted it here so people could follow the trail of your logs and history without having to dust off specialprefixindexthingy or any hacks to do it. As your status is very up in the air right now, that is the major concern--transparency. Will you be giving up the sysop bit on meta when your RTV cleaning is done? If you do, I have no problem if you nuke everything you made in userspace except your talk history. If you keep the bit, with a pending RFAR open, I reject your RTV (till the RFAR closes or you resign in process etc).

<dd>Why is Rootology insistently asking about the state of Aitias&#39;s sysop bit?  Since the case seems certain to be accepted, that can be considered by arbcom.  Since the issues raised in the RFAR do not concern ongoing use of the tools, I see no reason for urgency.  Many people have exercised their RTV before and retained their bit without controversy--Gator1, for example.  If the issue here is whether the behavior lends itself to removal of the bit, that&#39;s what arbcom is before. <a href="" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 22:15, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Setting aside the Arbcom dimension to this, the Right to Vanish only applies when the user intends to <i>vanish</i>, that is not return to editing with the account in question or with another account in secrecy. As such, there is no reason for the retention of the sysop flag. If someone has a change of heart on an RTV, their history and rights are restored, pending Bureaucrat approval. That is how the system is supposed to work. Speaking hypothetically, an administrator ought not to be allowed duck out while under a cloud and come back when the fuss has died down and resume editing as usual. &#60;font color=&#34;404040&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Skomorokh">&#60;font face=&#34;Goudy Old Style&#34; color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Skomorokh&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62; 22:38, 16 March 2009 (UTC)</dd>

There is simply no policy under which one is compelled to ask for removal of the sysop bit.  If it needs to be removed, it is done so by arbcom&#39;s decision, without necessarily consulting the admin.  If such a decision doesn&#39;t exist, it is the admin&#39;s choice. <a href="" title="User:Chick Bowen">Chick Bowen</a> 23:19, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I think you missed the point. No one is saying he &#34;has to&#34; request its removal. They are saying its pointless for him to retain it if he is truly exercising his right to vanish and &#34;asking&#34; him if he will be doing so. <b><a href="" title="User:Synergy">&#60;font color=&#34;#222222&#34; face=&#34;Times New Roman&#34;&#62;Syn&#60;/font&#62;</a></b><a href="" title="User_talk:Synergy">&#60;font color=&#34;#222222&#34; face=&#34;Times New Roman&#34;&#62;ergy&#60;/font&#62;</a> 23:28, 16 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>If anyone wants to vanish they need to give up their admin bit(in the case &#34;under a cloud&#34;). They also need to stop editing.

<p>As an update; it is apparent that he is not actually retired/vanished as he has continued to edit since his &#34;announcement&#34;; while simultaneously (and against policy) protected several user talk pages.  I&#39;ve undone the protections, but this needs to stop and Aitias needs to make up his mind whether he is vanishing or not. <a href="" title="User:Swatjester">&#60;font color=&#34;red&#34;&#62;&#38;rArr;&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User_talk:Swatjester">&#60;font face=&#34;Euclid Fraktur&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;SWAT&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;goldenrod&#34;&#62;Jester&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="WP:DC">&#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;Son of the Defender&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/small&#62;</a> 01:23, 17 March 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>I&#39;m fully aware of the consternation as to what Aitias&#39;s plans are, as it&#39;s certainly caused some perplexity on the requests for arbitration page. That being said, please be open to the possibility that he hasn&#39;t made up his mind himself. The chance that a user who had intended to retire might change his mind is not so terrible that it should be keeping people awake at nights, and page protections or deletions can always be done if the person decides to come back or stick around. I certainly would prefer that Aitias not use any administrator tools while his status here is in a little bit of limbo. But my advice above, that some space be given to a colleague who is obviously going through a stressful time right now (whether or not some portion of the stress results from his own actions) remains in place. <a href="" title="User:Newyorkbrad">Newyorkbrad</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Newyorkbrad">talk</a>) 01:37, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

<p> 
Perhaps someone can help me: in my efforts to help a new user, I&#39;ve unwittingly prompted him to move his userpage and talkpage (I was trying to get him to move a draft article out of his userpage onto a subpage). He&#39;s moved <a href="" title="User:CBrowns">User:CBrowns</a> to <a href="" title="User:CBrownsDraft_of_Steve_Waldman_Article">User:CBrownsDraft_of_Steve_Waldman_Article</a>, and his talkpage along with it. Could an admin reverse the move? It requires the deletion of the redirect pages created at his original userpage and talkpage. Apologies for creating work *cringe* </p>
<p>Apologies too if this isn&#39;t the proper forum: the user and I appear to be in very different timezones, and it&#39;ll likely be hours before he comes online, discovers what happened, and learns enough about deletion process to place db-author and a rationale on the original userpages.

<dd>I don&#39;t see how you&#39;re comments are trying are productive on the talk page. You come there solely to put down the article and that is all you have done, all week. You are not making suggestions on how to improve the article, your badgering me. The issue at the talk page is dead, yet you keep reviving threads and keep getting shot down, not only by myself, but every other member of the related WikiProject. The format of the article follows the format of other featured lists and the old format has been removed from the article since January. You have been nothing but disruptive on this project and that talk page, revert warring and being blocked for <a href="" title="WP:DUCK">acting like a previously banned editor</a> (with your only saving grace being someone unblocking you after technical evidence supported you being unrelated to the banned editor). Let me make this very clear, you are not going to get consensus to change it back to the previous format where there is 300 less references, original research and violations of BLP. — <a href="" title="User:Moe Epsilon">&#60;font color=&#34;DD0000&#34;&#62;Moe&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Moe Epsilon">&#60;font color=&#34;0000FF&#34;&#62;ε&#60;/font&#62;</a> 18:13, 17 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>A user at 114.164.204.239 has continually removed information from the article on <a href="" title="Konjac">Konjac</a> (specifically removing &#34;devil&#39;s tongue&#34; and &#34;snake palm&#34; as alternate names for the plant) citing that these terms are offensive in his/her language.

<dd>Although you say that the information is sourced, I did not see any inline citations for this. Maybe it&#39;s in some source used somewhere else, or maybe it has changed with all the reverting, but adding one or two inline citations would help. Then we can explain that the information is factually accurate and ask him to provide evidence if he thinks it is incorrect. If the removal of this information is based solely on the fact that <a href="" title="WP:JDLI">he doesn&#39;t like it</a> and thinks that it is offensive, then we need to explain to him about <a href="" title="WP:NOTCENSORED">WP:NOTCENSORED</a>. There is already a link on his talk page about it, but we&#39;ll need a bit of a detailed explanation if we want to make him see sense.

<dd>Hmm, taking a look at both pages, <a href="" title="Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen">Ysgol Gyfun Rhydfelen</a> and <a href="" title="Ysgol Gyfun Gartholwg">Ysgol Gyfun Gartholwg</a>, there seems to be a dispute in their histories as to what to call it. They are obviousl the same thing so, yes, one does have to go. However it is not clear to me which is the current name.  Rhydfelen says the name is Gartholwg from 2006-2009. DOes the 2009 imply that the name has been changed back to Rhydfelen? Gartholwg states that the former name is Rhydfelen. I noticed on the talk page it mentioned that there is a vote on March 25 and the user stated that the name is currently Rhydfelen until then. Though we would probably have a definitive answer. Meanwhile I think the article that should stay is the Rhydfelen one because it is much older. I or any other admin can always move it later and change the redirect, but for now get what you need off Gartholwg to inject into Rhydfelen. <a href="" title="User:Valley2city">&#60;b&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;background: blue; color: white;&#34;&#62;&#60;font face=&#34;Comic Sans MS&#34;&#62;Valley&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/b&#62;</a>2<a href="" title="User talk:Valley2city">&#60;b&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;background: skyblue; color:white;&#34;&#62;city&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/b&#62;&#60;sup&#62;‽&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 15:27, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>All thats different is that Rhydfelen is in some places where Gartholwg is not (and vice versa) so you should just redirect for now. &#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid #000000;background:# 787878&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:rdunn">&#60;font style=&#34;color:# 787878;background:# 41653D;&#34;&#62;&#38;nbsp;rdunn&#60;/font&#62;</a><a href="" title="User_talk:rdunn">&#60;font style=&#34;color:# 41653D;&#34;&#62;PLIB&#38;nbsp;&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62; 15:36, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>A brief history for you. The school was called Rhydfelen but when it went into dis-repair a new school was built and in 2006 the old school closed and pupils and teachers moved to the new school. The name of the new school is Gartholwg as it is 2 miles from Rhydfelen village and in the village of Gartholwg. Staff and pupils have been challenging the name change ever since and on the 25th the council may re-consider. The school website, school signage (see photos) and headed paper is Gartholwg. However the school uniform still has the Rhydfelen badge as it has not been updated yet. However both pages are identical and one of them needs to go. I don&#39;t mind which for now as the name can be sorted at a later date. Thanks. <a href="" title="User:Thatsitivehadenough">Thatsitivehadenough</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Thatsitivehadenough">talk</a>) 15:44, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Thanks for all your time and help. I know this is a big ask but could you put the page on your watch list as it has potential for an edit war. I am just happy to have one article. Personally I would love to keep the old name but its impossible to walk past the school every day and not notice the big school sign giving its name as &#34;Gartholwg&#34;.

<dd>It looks like the beginning of a bio--Pedro was born in 1954 in Venezuela...the next section discusses his youth and his siblings, and the last section says that he joined the navy. (This is loosely translated, of course; my Spanish is not very good, but I can recognize a few of the words from my Spanish 1121 class last semester.) I doubt that anything priceless was lost when it was speedied. <b><a href="" title="User:Horologium">&#60;font color=&#34;DarkSlateGray&#34;&#62;Horologium&#60;/font&#62;</a></b> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Horologium">(talk)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 01:25, 15 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Well, he *is* a rear-admiral, and holds a diplomatic post; it&#39;s possible that there is some notability, although there&#39;s nothing in the deleted article to indicate it.

<p>Last month I noticed that after her departure, she fully protected her talk page. While I understood it at the time, I feel it needs to be removed. Not just because she continues to edit, but because there is no reason to leave it fully protected.

<dd>&#34;I don&#39;t want my talk page cluttered up with crap&#34;?  That&#39;s a stunning statement coming from anyone, much less a long-time editor and former admin.  I would love if my talk page didn&#39;t collect comments from the people who go into AfD with the idea that I&#39;m a censor attempting to force the deletion of their book on the way that Alien Xray Satellites Are Controlling Our Brains, and the vandals who hate me reverting them, but I don&#39;t have the admin tools to force them to leave me alone - nor do I want them.  In any case, anyone who is editing needs to be contactable via his or her talk page, period.  Not wanting to see comments from people on your talk page isn&#39;t a good reason to protect it.  Anyway, if we&#39;re going to be protecting anything, it should be BLPs.  <a href="" title="User:Flopsy Mopsy and Cottonmouth">Flopsy Mopsy and Cottonmouth</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Flopsy Mopsy and Cottonmouth">talk</a>) 21:14, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

When she was an active admin, I very much enjoyed Jennavecia&#39;s startlingly clear ability to speak the truth, however &#34;one edit in several weeks&#34; is rather misleading as her contributions history shows 30-odd edits since her final admin action of indefinitely fully protecting her talk page.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="New_Page_Patrolling">New Page Patrolling</span></h2>

<p>As many of you probably know, <a href="" title="Special:NewPages">Special:NewPages</a> contains a list of all Wikipedia articles created within the last 31 days. Many editors patrol the front end of the backlog, looking for immediately vandalism, spam, or copyright violations to nominate for <a href="" title="WP:CSD">speedy</a> or <a href="" title="WP:PROD">uncontroversial</a> deletion. However, the <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:NewPages&#38;dir=prev&#38;hidepatrolled=1" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:NewPages&#38;dir=prev&#38;hidepatrolled=1">back end</a> of the backlog is not as well covered, as one administrator, <a href="" title="User:DragonflySixtyseven">User:DragonflySixtyseven</a>, has had to handle the backlog pretty much by himself, from what I can tell, with help from a few other editors. Currently, the backlog can only stretch up to 31 days. After 31 days, it falls off the edge of the backlog and is <i>likely not seen again for a <b>long</b> long time</i>. Those articles are prime locations to keep BLP and other violations, so we have to make sure to check <i>all</i> of them. Luckily, we have not had articles disappear for a while now, but we are getting pretty close; there is often less than 24 hours left in the &#34;buffer&#34; - the time before the pages start to fall off. If Dragonfly disappears for even one day, the entire prospect of monitoring New Pages is useless, and dozens of bad pages will be able to able to fly right through.</p>
<p>Right now, the backlog at <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:NewPages&#38;dir=prev&#38;hidepatrolled=1" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:NewPages&#38;dir=prev&#38;hidepatrolled=1">New Page Patrolling</a> shows quite well why something like <a href="" title="WP:FR">Flagged Revisions</a> would never work. Unless people are willing to put in some serious effort, all it will do is build a giant backlog. So, come one, do you part. Please help out. If you are interested, add

<dd>I just patrolled about 40 articles with <a href="" title="WP:NPW">NewPageWatcher</a>. Hopefully that helps. On a side note, I wonder how many articles would need to be patrolled per day to keep up with the new articles being created. That would be nice to see some stats on that. <a href="" title="User talk:MuZemike">MuZemike</a> 21:23, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Personally, I don&#39;t think that there is any way to keep up with the creation of new articles. I just spent more than an hour on the back end of the list, and I only managed to mark about 10 as patrolled. A few were obviously good articles and just needed the box to be clicked; but two turned out to be copyvios, one needed speedy tagging as not asserting significance, and one I nominated at AfD. What with all the Googling, tagging, and AfDing involved, we&#39;d need an army of new-page patrollers to adequately handle the volume. <a href="" title="User:Deor">Deor</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Deor">talk</a>) 23:46, 13 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Pages definitely slip through, but every little bit helps. When the ability to mark new pages as patrolled was introduced, we notice a big drop in the pages at <a href="" title="WP:DEP">WP:DEP</a>, especially the speediable pages. My guess is that marking pages as patrolled helped avoid duplicate efforts, so more pages got a glance before showing up on the DEP list. Now if we could just convince some of the more enthusiast patrollers not to speedy every article they see within a minute of creation... :) --<a href="" title="User:Fabrictramp">&#60;font color=&#34;#228b22&#34; face=&#34;comic sans ms&#34;&#62;Fabrictramp&#60;/font&#62;</a> | <a href="" title="User talk:Fabrictramp">&#60;font color=&#34;#960018&#34; face=&#34;Papyrus&#34;&#62;talk to me&#60;/font&#62;</a> 23:58, 13 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I tried my hand at patrolling for a while when the feature was first enabled, and my impression is that for every inappropriate speedy tag there was a case of someone clicking &#34;patrolled&#34; without checking for copyvio (admittedly, a particular bugbear of mine) or really taking much of a look at the article for other problems. Speedy tagging at NPP comes in for a lot of criticism, but I&#39;d like to see an in-depth study of NPP practices as a whole—how many articles get speedy tags that are rejected, how many get speedy tags that result in deletion, how many are &#34;passed&#34; but later have to be deleted anyway, and so forth. I think that part of the problem is that, other than merely going on to the next article in the list whenever one is unsure about an article, db-tagging and just clicking &#34;patrolled&#34; are the two easiest things to do. Adding unsourced, notability, and other &#34;problem&#34; tags is (a little bit) harder, and actually investigating for copyvios, verification, etc., is hardest of all. <a href="" title="User:Deor">Deor</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Deor">talk</a>) 02:58, 14 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>

<dd>I was thinking of the articles that have dropped off the newpages list because of time and inattention. Am I correct in assuming these are still detectable as &#34;unpatrolled&#34;?

<p><b>John Reaves</b>- The script adds &#34;Patrol&#34; links next to the article names on the main page themselves; if you use popups; it makes patrolling much quicker. &#60;font color=&#34;navy&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:NuclearWarfare">NuclearWarfare</a>&#60;/font&#62;<b><i> &#60;sub&#62;(&#60;font color=&#34;green&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:NuclearWarfare">Talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;)&#60;/sub&#62;</i></b> 00:26, 14 March 2009 (UTC))</p>

<dl>
<dd>Speaking for myself, I&#39;ve pretty much given up patrolling the back side because it is so unproductive.  A lot of the articles there are superficially valid but so trivial that I&#39;m not willing to go to the effort of looking up sources to verify them (e.g., tiny villages in India, subway stations in New York, Slovak soccer players, etc, etc.)  I&#39;ve found that most of the articles I look at, I pass by without marking, unless they have tags that allow me to mark them as patrolled without doing anything.  At the front end it&#39;s a different story -- I probably mark 2/3 of the articles I look at. <a href="" title="User:Looie496">Looie496</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Looie496">talk</a>) 02:48, 14 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>When I patrol, I just take a quick look to make sure the article is not a speedy candidate and move on unless something jumps out and bites me. Copyvios usually have a copy/pasted look and look more like a web page or a piece of spam then an article. Also, corin bot has in the past done a pretty good job finding copyvios but I don&#39;t know how well its working now. I don&#39;t think its necessary to go on a google hunt for every article one patrols.

<p><b>Suggestion</b>- we could add a feature to the script in which a person could click on a special Patrol link on Special:Newpages, and if the person does not do anything about the article then it would automatically be marked as patrolled. Or, if the person navigates away from the page, then a prompt would show asking if they want to mark the page as patrolled. The problem is that most people do not bother to click the mark as patrolled link. This would help cut down the backlog. &#60;font color=&#34;maroon&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Letsdrinktea">Lets</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;olive&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Letsdrinktea">drink</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;blue&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Letsdrinktea">Tea</a>&#60;/font&#62; 02:44, 14 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>What does help is that <a href="" title="WP:friendly">friendly</a> and <a href="" title="WP:TW">twinkle</a> now mark the page as patrolled when you use them to do something with it. I think one of the big problems in the past was that when you add a tag to the page, manually edit it, check talk, history, etc. the patrol link disappears. What would be useful would be a script that adds a &#34;patrol&#34; and a &#34;don&#39;t patrol&#34; button to the page. Both buttons remain visible whenever you revisit the page unless you click one or the page is patrolled by somebody else. --<a href="" title="User:Ron Ritzman">Ron Ritzman</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ron Ritzman">talk</a>) 01:54, 16 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>From what I&#39;ve noticed there are typically around 500 pages (after deletions are accounted for) that are created per day, so that would be the number we would have to patrol to keep up with the backlog. --<a href="" title="User:Nn123645">Nn123645</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nn123645">talk</a>) 14:34, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>500? 1500 is more like it. The current back of the newpages list (one month old, so most speedies and so on should be gone) has a day of over 2000 new pages, a day like February 18th still has way over 1000 new articles, just like February 19th.

In the last few days I made several edits to some album articles, as well to some other articles, most of them with well-explained edit summaries and rationale. A while ago <a href="" title="User:Enigmaman">User:Enigmaman</a> (<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Enigmaman">edits</a>) reverted all of my recent edits with Huggle, describing them as vandalism, and promptly giving me a warning.

He then gave me another warning, and asked me not to remove a review from the article and adding another review (a move which I clearly explained in the edit summary). I <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Enigmaman&#38;diff=278051151&#38;oldid=277862261" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Enigmaman&#38;diff=278051151&#38;oldid=277862261">attempted to explain</a> that my edits were not vandalism, and advised him not to use Huggle to revert what are obviously not vandalism.

<dd>As I have described above, most of my edits have edit summaries. You could check my contributions page yourself. They are clearly explained and clearly NOT vandalism. Moreover, I explained the situation in his talk page and the explanation was deleted and I was reported in AIGV.

<dd>That is clearly a content dispute issue, and has nothing to do with vandalism. You can go check the site yourself. The site tends like alternative rock bands, which explains the high ratings. But plenty of other sites have given high ratings to those bands. Also, I have explained my reason for the removal of pop reviews, quite reasonably. I&#39;m not sure what your objection is.

<dd>Outright removal of reviews would be considered blanking and, yes, vandalism. However, I clearly explained my rationale in the edit summary. In this case, I demonstrated good faith, and if one doubts my intentions, he should question me on my talk page instead of considering it vandalism. Also, in response to Enigmaman - why the hell is the change from &#34;bias&#34; to &#34;antipathy&#34; damaging or vandalism? It is a semantical change, which, if you check the dictionary, is absolutely correct. I&#39;m not sure what Enigmaman&#39;s problem is. In my edit summaries, in my response to him, and in this report, I have demonstrated my understanding of Wikipedia policy and have stressed my good faith. If I am a vandal I clearly would not do so. <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/202.40.139.168">202.40.139.168</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:202.40.139.168">talk</a>) 07:23, 18 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>To my knowledge, Allmusic is not an accepted review site on all Wikipedia album articles. For some genres, Wikipedia standards is to preferably use review sites dedicated to those genres. This remains a content dispute, however. It does not justify your reverts of my content edits using counter-vandalism tools and your deletion of my good-faith response on your talk page. It also does not justify your reverts of my other edits, some of which are completely irrelevant to the topic. I am still waiting for your explanation on why those edits are vandalism. Also, I did not distort any facts. Another user did warn me - I never said you were the only one. However, I have responded to him and he has not responded to me. It appears that you have deleted my comment on his talk page as well. May I inquire why? <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/202.40.139.168">202.40.139.168</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:202.40.139.168">talk</a>) 07:21, 18 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Threatening to take me to AN/I for daring to revert you is not a &#34;good-faith response&#34; at all. Neither is creating an AN thread accusing me of abuse. As for Allmusic, it is an accepted review site on all album articles that I know of, and removing it is inappropriate. <a href="" title="User:Enigmaman"><b>&#60;font color=&#34;blue&#34;&#62;Enigma&#60;/font&#62;</b></a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Enigmaman"><i>&#60;font color=&#34;#FFA500&#34;&#62;msg&#60;/font&#62;</i></a>&#60;/sup&#62; 07:26, 18 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>You reverted an edit that has a clear edit summary. It may be inappropriate, or damaging, but it is definitely not vandalism. Using Huggle to make such an revert is a misuse of the Huggle tool, and there have been past precedents that misuse of Huggle is reported on the AN/I. It was not a threat, but a justified warning. I created this thread after you removed my response to you on your talk page, displaying extremely bad faith on your part.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Possible_harassment">Possible harassment</span></h2>

<p>Good evening. I have a serious problem with user &#34;Bali Ultimate&#34;. He appears to be harassing me very severely; he is following every edit I make, commenting when I comment on other people&#39;s talk pages, constantly threatening me with various actions under Wikipedia policy, systematically going through to other pages I have edited and making serious edits on them, pursuing anyone who sided with me in a particularly contentious AfD discussion... and it is truly upsetting me in real life. This user refuses to acknowledge my problems; I have tried to discuss this with him, and why I view his behavior this way, but he has been unwilling to listen. I invite you to look at any logs that you would desire to to demonstrate this; mostly, I am looking for an impartial eye on this issue, and some way to resolve this contentiousness. Thank you. <a href="" title="User:Ks64q2">Ks64q2</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ks64q2">talk</a>) 06:23, 18 March 2009 (UTC)

<p>No need to block. He is requesting deletion of an article, that at the time, was full of libel and BLP nightmares.

<p>I am quite disgusted by this. Not only have we slandered the guy, then when the abuse was removed, the removal was reverted by admins. Then when he requests deletion to prevent further slander, people say &#34;tough shit we are keeping it&#34; - and even suggest that he learns how to remove slander by learning wiki rules. Now people want to put in a new hoop that he should confirm his identity, and someone about above actually wants to &#34;block on sight&#34;. When will Wikipedians wake up to the fact that it is WRONG for us to have a system that allows people to be slandered, and when subjects are abused, it is OUR FAULT NOT THEIRS, and the onus is on US not THEM to ensure that it will not hapen again. And if we can&#39;t do that (which, lacking flags, BLP protection, or realistic quality control) we should remove the article and get out of their lives. Now, will people wake up and take responsibility for this monstrosity we call an encyclopedia.

<dd>Agreed, and that is my point above. I don&#39;t see why he needs to confirm that he is Rod Dreher in this case; he is merely using his account (if it is him) to publically remove this formerly slanderous article. The fact that this was public for <i>four days</i> with no removal is indication that we need flagged revisions and a major overhaul to our BLP policies. And the fact that administrators were reverting to keep this libelous and slanderous content on is even more disturbing. &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User:Seicer">&#60;font color=&#34;#CC0000&#34;&#62;seicer&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#38;#x007C; <a href="" title="User_talk:Seicer">&#60;font color=&#34;#669900&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#38;#x007C; <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Seicer">&#60;font color=&#34;#669900&#34;&#62;contribs&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/small&#62; 18:18, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

Until editors take responsibility and Wikipedia actually incorporates a system to transform it from a defamation machine to an encyclopaedia, I&#39;d support stubbing and semi-protecting every BLP like this.

Though it doesn&#39;t explicitly say so, I interpret this to mean that a bad faith AfD nomination <i>should not</i> be closed as such <i>if</i> unrelated editors agree with the deletion. It sounds to me that since quite a number of editors have strong opinions on its deletion (many of which were entered after I originally posted this here), and it appears those editors have no personal connection to the nominator or the article subject, we should <i>let AfD run its course</i> &#38;ndash; <i>regardless of what the outcome is</i> &#38;ndash; and let the identity issue be resolved separately (if there is one after the AfD is closed). &#60;span style=&#34;color:#808080&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Kuyabribri">KuyaBriBri</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:#008080&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_Talk:Kuyabribri">Talk</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 19:22, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I just wanted to note here that I&#39;ve declined the <a href="" title="WP:UAA">WP:UAA</a> listing for Rod Dreher.  Before reading the discussion here I agreed that a &#34;block first, verify later&#34; approach would cause more harm than good.  I feel it&#39;s plausible it&#39;s the real Rod Dreher; this is not the first time this has happened and it won&#39;t be the last.  I did suggest to him that if he intends to continue editing after the deletion debate ends, it would be good to verify his identity.  I figure if his request for deletion succeeds, he&#39;ll be done.. and if not, he&#39;ll probably want to talk to Wikimedia directly, so it probably won&#39;t be much of a burden unless he does decide to get involved more deeply.  <a href="" title="User:Mangojuice">Mango</a><a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Mangojuice">&#60;span style=&#34;color:orange&#34;&#62;<b>juice</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Mangojuice">talk</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 20:46, 17 March 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<p>You mean, the system worked this time? Who would have thunk it? At any rate, now that the identity issue appears to be resolved, I still don&#39;t agree with the article&#39;s SK per my remarks above but I guess if there truly is a strong consensus to delete due to BLP violations someone will re-nominate it. I guess I can also understand the need for a &#34;clean&#34; AfD discussion that doesn&#39;t factor in the article subject&#39;s wishes (or in this case, the wishes of someone impersonating the article subject). Oh well, with that out of the way I have no opinion on the other issues brought up in the AfD, wish the real Rod Dreher the best, and am moving on. &#60;span style=&#34;color:#808080&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Kuyabribri">KuyaBriBri</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:#008080&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_Talk:Kuyabribri">Talk</a>&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 16:42, 18 March 2009 (UTC)

<p>This might happen again. Possible ways to prevent it:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Don&#39;t let an editor with the user name of the BLP propose an AfD without verification of that user name first. Otherwise, sympathy for the BLP can interfere with the judgment of the AfD participants.</li>
<li>Don&#39;t wait to block an editor with the user name of a BLP. Block first, then let the person clear the name with the WP office. Block before the editor does damage to the BLP&#39;s reputation. This doesn&#39;t need to be spelled out. In order not to be too rough on a real notable person who opens an account under his or her own name, when the block is done it should be done very, very politely, perhaps with a super polite template. No harm in that. That&#39;s all I can think of. Perhaps other people have ideas. -- <a href="" title="User:Noroton">Noroton</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Noroton">talk</a>) 17:08, 18 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ol>

<p>Indef blocking a long-term editor (who&#39;s contributed since 2007 and never been blocked) for a 1hr outburst of anger as a &#34;vandalism-only account&#34; seems neither fair nor constructive for WP; I&#39;m not sure the blocking admin&#39;s &#34;skimming&#34; the contribs did the editor justice.

<dd>First off I&#39;d like to point out that I&#39;m not an administrator and did not not make the block. After looking at all of the users contribs I can say that a vandalism only account as a rationale for blocking shouldn&#39;t apply. When I wrote my previous reply I was unaware that the user&#39;s contribs went that far back; you are correct in the fact that the user does have several hundred constructive contribs. Though I do notice by looking through the contribs that this user has had some incivility problems in the past, though on the majority of the user&#39;s discussions he is civil and constructive. —<a href="" title="User:Nn123645">Nn123645</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nn123645">talk</a>) 02:49, 19 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>DAMN IT, I thought we already settled this! So that guy lied to me when he said he will speak English. I&#39;m sorry for going PA-ish on this, but they&#39;re both hypocrites by posting EN userboxes when they don&#39;t even practice it here that much. And to think Secaundis is speaking english in the SM City Tungko AFD.--<a href="" title="User:Eaglestorm">Eaglestorm</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Eaglestorm">talk</a>) 02:20, 15 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>A random sampling of each user&#39;s article edits shows only good faith edits. I don&#39;t see anything wrong with them communicating to each other in their native tongue. The Good Practice Guideline regarding English language use on talk pages says &#34;it is preferred that you use English on English Wikipedia talk pages.&#34; So this is not a blockable offense. If they are not capable of providing translations, maybe we can find a translator. <a href="" title="User:Kingturtle">Kingturtle</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kingturtle">talk</a>) 14:46, 16 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>I have to agree with Kingturtle here. Unless there&#39;s evidence they are using another language to conceal details about what they are discussing or using wikipedia as a social network to an extent that is normally likely to result in action even if in English then provided it only occurs on user talk pages let them be. In other words it&#39;s the content that matters not the language. Why people need to be so concerned about what others are saying, I do not know. P.S. I&#39;m somewhat doubtful the Tagalog wikipedia is this anal about people who speak in English or something else on user talkpages <a href="" title="User:Nil Einne">Nil Einne</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nil Einne">talk</a>) 10:22, 18 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>First, the Tagalog Wikipedia is not that anal pertaining to discussions taking place between people in personal correspondence.  Admittedly, while virtually all Tagalog Wikipedia contributors are, in one way or another, bilingual or multilingual, English text is always italicized on public talk, while not so in private talk.</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I&#39;m a bit surprised that we&#39;re making a mountain out of a molehill with this problem.  Seeing the edits of both users I highly doubt they would use Tagalog communication to hide secret activities, and that their contributions are valid even with Secaundis&#39; lack of fluency in English.  We can&#39;t expect Wikipedians to be fluent in English on the fly.  However, when it comes to the field of public correspondence, that is when we must switch languages to the language of the majority (English).  If people are so concerned with the contents of their discussions, then feel free to ask a Filipino Wikipedian to translate the contents to English. --<a href="" title="User:Sky Harbor">&#60;font color=&#34;#0066ff&#34; &#62;&#60;b&#62;Sky Harbor&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Sky Harbor">&#60;font color=&#34;#0066ff&#34; &#62;&#60;b&#62;talk&#60;/b&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 09:06, 19 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>In brief, the Abuse Filter allows automated heuristics to be run against every edit. It&#39;s designed as an anti-vandalism tool for very simple and/or pattern based vandalism.</p>

<p>Hi, I am <a href="" title="User:GlobeGores">User:GlobeGores</a> on wikibreak. I was looking at an article recently when I noticed there had been edits to my IP&#39;s talk page (through the &#34;new messages&#34; orange bar). I was surprised to see an entire article (entitled &#34;When, Where and How did Laura Nyro first meet her eventual life partner, Maria Desiderio?&#34;) being written on my talk page by the user in the title. If you look at their userspace, you might see that they&#39;ve quite proudly admitted to using my talkpage as their own personal sandbox to work with the article.</p>
<p>While I have no objections to honest efforts to build the encyclopedia, I was wondering if someone here could talk to Ralph about using their own userspace rather than random IP talkpages and/or move the content in question to a subpage.</p>
<p>Apologies if this is the wrong venue for these complaints.</p>

<p>Sorry to bother everyone with this one, but it&#39;s another protocol issue I&#39;m curious about. The referenced article has been prod&#39;d (though speedy is far more appropriate). The interesting thing is, the article has been so heavily and consistently vandalized over the past two years, it bears almost no resemblance to the original content (a link can be seen on the article&#39;s talk page). However, the <i>original</i> article should be speedied. Should the article be reverted back through almost two years worth of vandalism to an article that still should be tagged for a speedy (and is a pure vanity piece anyway), or should a &#60;nowiki&#62; &#60;/nowiki&#62; just be placed over the top as is? My biggest concern with that, which is admittedly just a matter of procedure, is that the article would be deleted for the wrong reasons. <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/74.69.39.11">74.69.39.11</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:74.69.39.11">talk</a>) 22:34, 19 March 2009 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Huge_copyright_mess.2C_redux">Huge copyright mess, redux</span></h2>

<p>Hi. Those of you who saw this <a href="#A_very_large_and_widespread_CopyVio_problem" title="Wikipedia:Administrators&#39;_noticeboard/IncidentArchive521">ANI</a> conversation already know that we are dealing with possibly about 1,000 copyright violations related to <a href="" title="Arthur William Baden Powell">Powell A. W. B.</a>, <i>New Zealand Mollusca</i>, William Collins Publishers Ltd, Auckland, New Zealand 1979 <a class="external text" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0002169061" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0002169061">ISBN 0-00-216906-1</a>. I&#39;m quite pleased to say that clean-up is well underway. It&#39;s a lot of work, but <a href="" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Gastropods">Wikipedia:WikiProject Gastropods</a> has rallied around it, and there are contributors to the cleanup from the newly (and just in time) formed <a href="" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Copyright Cleanup">Wikipedia:WikiProject Copyright Cleanup</a>. The project task force set up for cleaning it (a bit chaotic, which is understandable in the scurry; I think it&#39;s astoundingly well organized all things considered) is <a href="" title="Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Gastropods/Subpage for organizing CopyVio Cleanup">here</a>.</p>
<p>However, it has just been confirmed at that project taskforce page that the contributor involved, <a href="" title="User:GrahamBould">User:GrahamBould</a>, has also introduced infringement from at least one other source. <a href="" title="User:Sadalmelik">User:Sadalmelik</a> notes <a href="#The_question_of_the_Category:Molluscs_of_Australia_and_other_articles" title="Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Gastropods/Subpage_for_organizing_CopyVio_Cleanup">here</a> that <a href="" title="Blotchy swell shark">Blotchy swell shark</a> and <a href="" title="Blackspot shark">Blackspot shark</a> both copy content from fishbase.org, which has a non-commercial cc license and hence is unusable here. (I haven&#39;t been able to load the sources personally to verify these articles, both of which are still viewable. It may also impact non-shark articles like <a href="" title="Longtail skate">Longtail skate</a>, which also cites that website.) That means we go from 1,000 or so articles to, well, I don&#39;t know how many. Sadalmelik also notes that <a href="" title="User:GrahamBould">User:GrahamBould</a> has created 2,543 articles. We could really use more assistance on this. The articles in <a href="" title="Category:Gastropods of New Zealand">Category:Gastropods of New Zealand</a> may be underway, but I do not know the full scope of this problem.</p>
<p>I am concerned that there may be infringement from more sources than are currently identified. For example, in the February 2009 article <a href="" title="Phillip Pearsall Carpenter">Phillip Pearsall Carpenter</a> I see piecemeal borrowing from the source, <a class="externallink" href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:2SYY4GTXXp0J:www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/subjects/splas/staff/patience-schell/thefile,100927,en.doc+%22Philip+Pearsall+Carpenter%22+educator,+a+minister,+and+a+natural+historian,+and+influenced+his+son%E2%80%99s+interest+in+natural+history+through+the+Bristol+Institution.&#38;cd=3&#38;hl=en&#38;ct=clnk&#38;gl=us&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow" title="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:2SYY4GTXXp0J:www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/subjects/splas/staff/patience-schell/thefile,100927,en.doc+%22Philip+Pearsall+Carpenter%22+educator,+a+minister,+and+a+natural+historian,+and+influenced+his+son%E2%80%99s+interest+in+natural+history+through+the+Bristol+Institution.&#38;cd=3&#38;hl=en&#38;ct=clnk&#38;gl=us&#38;client=firefox-a"><a class="externallink" href="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:2SYY4GTXXp0J:www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/subjects/splas/staff/patience-schell/thefile,100927,en.doc+%22Philip+Pearsall+Carpenter%22+educator,+a+minister,+and+a+natural+historian,+and+influenced+his+son%E2%80%99s+interest+in+natural+history+through+the+Bristol+Institution.&#38;cd=3&#38;hl=en&#38;ct=clnk&#38;gl=us&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow" title="http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:2SYY4GTXXp0J:www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/subjects/splas/staff/patience-schell/thefile,100927,en.doc+%22Philip+Pearsall+Carpenter%22+educator,+a+minister,+and+a+natural+historian,+and+influenced+his+son%E2%80%99s+interest+in+natural+history+through+the+Bristol+Institution.&#38;cd=3&#38;hl=en&#38;ct=clnk&#38;gl=us&#38;client=firefox-a">http://74.125.47.132/search?q=cache:2SYY4GTXXp0J:www.llc.manchester.ac.uk/subjects/splas/staff/patience-schell/thefile,100927,en.doc+%22Philip+Pearsall+Carpenter%22+educator,+a+minister,+and+a+natural+historian,+and+influenced+his+son%E2%80%99s+interest+in+natural+history+through+the+Bristol+Institution.&#38;cd=3&#38;hl=en&#38;ct=clnk&#38;gl=us&#38;client=firefox-a</a></a>, in a way that gives me great concern. His article says, &#34;He devoted the majority of the remainder of his life to these shells, presenting part of his collection (8,873 specimens), mounted, classified and many described, to the British Museum in 1857.&#34; The source says, &#34;He devoted the majority of the remainder of his life to these shells...&#34; &#34;He presented part of his collection (8,873 specimens), mounted, classified and many described, to the British Museum in 1857&#34; (I have not gone over the article line by line to see if infringement is extensive.) I worry that other articles may also contain a pastiche of fragments from copyrighted sources.</p>
<p>I think we need to discuss if and under what circumstances this contributor can be safely allowed to continue. It worries me that he persisted even after offered guidance over a year ago. </p>
<p>I&#39;d also really appreciate feedback on how best to process this. Neither the Gastropod project nor the new Copyright Cleanup project have the manpower to evaluate 2,500 articles. I think the 1,000 they&#39;re working on is pretty heroic as it is. Should we delete with extreme prejudice? Provide a bounty for cleanup? Recruit assistance from other projects? How best to proceed? --<a href="" title="User:Moonriddengirl">Moonriddengirl</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Moonriddengirl">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 00:33, 18 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>He has a list of sources on his userpage. Since he&#39;s violated the copyright of two, its safe to assume that he may have done so with others. <a href="" title="User:Avruch">&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;Avruch&#60;/strong&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Avruch">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;  T  &#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 00:43, 18 March 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Is this really a case of a misunderstanding? That appears to be the way the discussion was heading prior to discovering the other instances of copyright violations. If the user genuinely did not understand how copyrights work, and is working with others to correct problems, then I could see a justification for leaving him unblocked. On the other hand, if he had the opportunity to point out that this behavior pattern extended to other sources and did not... That would be active deception, which combined with everything else may mean that an indefinite (re)block is in order. <a href="" title="User:Avruch">&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;Avruch&#60;/strong&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Avruch">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;  T  &#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 00:51, 18 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>As regards teh contributor, I think confusion is a possibility, but there is the matter that the copyright policy was pointed out to him in February of 2008, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GrahamBould&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=194272402#Doto_pita_and_others" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:GrahamBould&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=194272402#Doto_pita_and_others">at the bottom of his talk page here</a>, but he persisted. He has expressed remorse over this, <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cygnis_insignis&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=277589608" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Cygnis_insignis&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=277589608">here</a> and <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moonriddengirl&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=277999151" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk:Moonriddengirl&#38;diff=prev&#38;oldid=277999151">at my talk page</a> a couple of minutes ago. I believe he may well be sincere. But if he persisted after that February 2008 warning because he didn&#39;t understand, how can we know he understands now? If we do not indef block, I wonder if he would benefit from mentorship from someone familiar with his field. I can&#39;t undertake that, both because I&#39;m swamped with this cleanup and because I&#39;m already mentoring somebody for just that very concern. It&#39;s time consuming, checking for possible infringement. </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>It might make sense to move the thousands of articles he created to his userspace temporarily while they are evaluated and cleaned. User:GrahamBould/Copyvio_Check/Article_Name might be a way to go. A bot could presumably scrape his create log and move all the pages. The first priority would be creating clean stubs and moving them back, and then improving the articles themselves over time. <a href="" title="User:Avruch">&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;Avruch&#60;/strong&#62;</a><a href="" title="User talk:Avruch">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;strong style=&#34;color:#228B22;&#34;&#62;  T  &#60;/strong&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 01:26, 18 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Just to be clear, we&#39;d need the articles subpaged, a list of redirects generated to be deleted by hand, a list of articles moved (perhaps by category or alphabetical?

<dd>Also, at this point, I&#39;m tempted to consider <i>all</i> of this contributor&#39;s major prose contributions as suspected copyvios until demonstrated otherwise.

<li>&#34;That means we go from 1,000 or so articles to, well, I don&#39;t know how many.&#34; I doubt it is this drastic. A single line copy from fishbase is not really a copyright infringement. It&#39;s only the case if extensive sections of text are copied. Citing for example a definition of something can rarely be done in your own words without compromising on proper meaning. Be careful of deleting material that can be saved by rewriting and deleting the copyvio history instead. - <a href="" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic">&#60;sup&#62;(talk)&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 12:09, 18 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Are you volunteering to help with the fishbase articles, then? :) As I said, I haven&#39;t been able to load the source myself, and I&#39;m pretty preoccupied with the molluscs (to wit <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Moonriddengirl">Special:Contributions/Moonriddengirl</a>) --<a href="" title="User:Moonriddengirl">Moonriddengirl</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Moonriddengirl">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 12:16, 18 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>Why is this person still not blocked? &#60;font face=&#34;Verdana&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Durova">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#009&#34;&#62;Durova&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 06:04, 19 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I had requested that he come here and give us some frank information on how widespread this problem is. Whether his infringement was based on not comprehending copyright laws and policies or something else, his expressions of remorse have seemed sincere, and admitting sources he&#39;s copied from would be a big help. However, he hasn&#39;t edited since that request. He was blocked earlier, briefly, by another admin, but the same admin unblocked him to allow him to respond to these concerns. As far as future contributions, I don&#39;t know if supervision from one of the several project members who have encouraged him to continue editing at his talk page after this event would be sufficient safeguard or not; I would feel very uneasy with his continuing to contribute <i>without</i> close supervision. Since he hasn&#39;t been editing either to react to or ignore my request, it&#39;s been a lower priority for me. That said, if this conversation heads towards archival without feedback from him, then I think reblocking would be a good idea. There&#39;s no harm in waiting, but forgetting could be a different issue. And if somebody wants to take his lack of response here and at the earlier ANI thread as indication that he isn&#39;t going to respond, I certainly have no objection to his being blocked before that happens. --<a href="" title="User:Moonriddengirl">Moonriddengirl</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Moonriddengirl">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 12:04, 19 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Why is an unblock necessary to respond to concerns?  That&#39;s what user talk access is for.  He was confronted with concerns a year ago and kept right on doing it.  With a problem as massive as this, shouldn&#39;t the onus would be on <i>him</i> to earn back the privilege of editing?  Perhaps by assisting with the cleanup.  But the problem he&#39;s caused here is much more disruptive than the typical things we block for. &#60;font face=&#34;Verdana&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Durova">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#009&#34;&#62;Durova&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 15:39, 19 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If he continues to add content without responding to the concerns, a block would be appropriate to prevent further copyvio. If he&#39;s not editing the mainspace though, there&#39;s no immediate concern and a block would be punitive. –&#60;font face=&#34;Verdana&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<b>xeno</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/font&#62; 16:12, 19 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It might encourage him to take actions that would remedy the existing problem.  There&#39;s nothing wrong with setting unblock conditions, since a huge amount of copyvio material remains to be cleaned up and he should be expected to help with that cleanup if he wants to edit this site again.  To block someone after an edit war has ended would be punitive, since that problem ends when the edit war ends.  But the damage here has not been undone. &#60;font face=&#34;Verdana&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Durova">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#009&#34;&#62;Durova&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 18:33, 19 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>I just wanted to point out that GB was <i>still editing in mainspace</i> as of yesterday 18th March. At 4:45 on Tuesday March 17th, he actually started a new gastropod (sea slug) article <a href="" title="Berthella ornata">Berthella ornata</a>,  and started a new shrimp article <a href="" title="Alope spinifrons">Alope spinifrons</a>  on that same day. In the sea slug article, there are no long copyings, but the short phrases &#34;Endemic to New Zealand&#34; and &#34;under rocks&#34; are verbatim, if that&#39;s relevant.

<ul>
<li>Oh good grief! There are some phrases that simply cannot be avoided. Any author on the topic will use them, and its not an issue of copyright. See <a href="" title="Endemism">Endemism</a> - endemic has a specific meaning - it is not the same as <i>native</i>, and there is no acceptable synonym.  <a href="" title="User:Dramatic">dramatic</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dramatic">talk</a>) 05:03, 20 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do understand that. However, he needs to be watched very carefully. The important point is that despite being blocked and then unblocked only so that he could reply to the very serious charges, he is still editing in mainspace (Xeno thought that he wasn&#39;t doing this, which is why I pointed it out) and he is creating articles by himself without any supervision, and without being given the OK. Despite being asked to do so twice, he has <i>not</i> come to this noticeboard to answer the very serious charges against him, and he has not agreed to help us by telling us anything about what was copied and what was not copied of his thousands of articles, thus forcing us to scramble to attempt to ascertain this ourselves. I personally don&#39;t see very much evidence of remorse, and his history of persevering in the face of having been warned clearly a year ago suggests the intent to deceive. <a href="" title="User:Invertzoo">Invertzoo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Invertzoo">talk</a>) 12:31, 20 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<dd>There needs to be some form of Wikiprobation where problem editors willing to be reintegrated with society have all their contributions moderated. It would be better than indef-banning someone and then having to watch for new accounts who are suddenly active in the same fields. Anyway, I&#39;m off to reassess all the WPNZ statuses for the mollusc articles, because (on my advice) GB tagged all the more substantial ones as start class. <a href="" title="User:Dramatic">dramatic</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dramatic">talk</a>) 02:04, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>There is such a solution, but it hasn&#39;t been implemented here.  He was unblocked unnecessarily when user talk access would have been adequate.  He was not placed under mentorship, not assigned any formal restriction, and has ignored the stated purpose of the unblock while returning to article edits.  Meanwhile over a thousand pages of his creation--much of which are probably copyvio--await review.  The admin community has not even required that he give any assistance at all to the volunteers who are starting the daunting task of cleaning it up.  And in case the weight of this hasn&#39;t sunk in, what he&#39;s been doing is illegal.  He kept on breaking the law for a year after he was asked to discuss it.  Something is very wrong with our site culture, when all of that gets a wink and a nod. &#60;font face=&#34;Verdana&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Durova">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#009&#34;&#62;Durova&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/font&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<i><a href="" title="User talk:Durova">Charge!</a></i>&#60;/sup&#62; 02:19, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Well, we can&#39;t <i>require</i> that he give us assistance, unfortunately, until the Wikimedia Foundation earns sovereignty. :) There&#39;s no winking &#38; nodding on my part, anyway. While I have been extremely busy in the trenches cleaning up after him, I take copyright problems <i>very</i> seriously, and I have been watching for a return to any activity on his part. We have collectively cleaned around 1,000 articles since this was brought to light and are trying to figure out how to handle the next nearly 1,000. Meanwhile, what&#39;s really wrong with our site culture, I think, is that so much of this goes undetected. Just yesterday I found another contributor whose entire history seems to have involved violating copyright on Wikipedia (see <a href="#Anyone_around_to_help_with_a_contribution_check.3F" title="Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_Copyright_Cleanup">background</a>). I&#39;m kicking myself on that one, because the bulk of his infringement came after the first time I encountered him at <a href="" title="WP:CP">WP:CP</a>. If I had followed up on him, I could have stopped him. (I follow up on some, but not most; there are so many. :/ I&#39;ve given him a block warning, since he had not received one, and will be watching him now. The vast majority of copyright infringers who land at CP get  , which is a very warm advisory operating on the obvious presumption of error. I&#39;ve wondered if it should incorporate some of the stronger language at   to emphasize that this isn&#39;t an &#34;Oh, gee&#34; problem, but a serious concern.) Maybe it would be worth talking to <a href="" title="WP:NPP">WP:NPP</a> about scanning for copyright violations. Given that I have several times recently found DYK articles that infringed; since the hard working contributors at that project evaluate articles, perhaps they could be asked to keep an eye out, too. --<a href="" title="User:Moonriddengirl">Moonriddengirl</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Moonriddengirl">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 12:05, 21 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>We require mentorship as terms of an unblock; we topic ban people as terms of an unblock.  In same spirit we could require cleanup assistance as terms of an unblock, for prolific copyright violators.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Sourcing_at_List_of_common_misconceptions">Sourcing at <a href="" title="List of common misconceptions">List of common misconceptions</a></span></h2>

<p>The entry immediately above this put me in mind of a dispute i&#39;m in, so posting here. I have no problem with &#34;filibustering&#34; or complaints about other editors (there are editors I disagree with, but their behavior is not a problem). The minor dispute at the moment (minor because i&#39;m not deleting anything) has to do with this list. Many/most of the listed items there have no reliable sources establishing that they are in fact &#34;common misconceptions&#34; (or any words that would generally be accepted to equal the same thing). This article is currently at AfD, and I am among those arguing it should be deleted (meta reason: don&#39;t believe &#34;common misconception&#34; is definable in the limited, specfic sense true categories would require). But if the article survives, i believe strongly that our standards for reliable sourcing should be enforced. The feelings of one, some or even many editors on wikipedia that something is a &#34;common misconception&#34; are insufficient to over-ride standards of <a href="" title="WP:V">verifiability</a>, <a href="" title="WP:RS">sourcing</a> and <a href="" title="WP:NOTE">notability</a>. I&#39;m just asking for more eyes and advice. Were i to unilaterally impose these standards (i know we&#39;re not supposed to do anything unilaterally) we would quickly be in an edit war.<a href="" title="User:Bali ultimate">Bali ultimate</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Bali ultimate">talk</a>) 21:06, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>If its at AFD, then that discussion probably takes primacy over anything here.  There does not appear to be anything here for admins to do.  Please let the AFD run its course, trust the admin who closes it to make a well thought-out decision on how to interpret consensus, and continue to discuss the matter at the talk pages of the policy and guideline pages you cite.  Again, this may be an important issue, but this noticeboard is limited to issues that need admins to deal with.  I don&#39;t see where a protection, a block, or a deletion is imperitive here... --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;contribs&#60;/small&#62;</a> 21:19, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Would you advise me to unilaterally removed unsourced material? This would not be well received. I don&#39;t want sanctions, or protection, or the whole article to have something done to it. I&#39;m seeking assistance in enforcing standards of inclusion (the AfD i agree will determine whether the article persists or not; but it should be improved in the interim, and after if it survives). <a href="" title="User:Bali ultimate">Bali ultimate</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Bali ultimate">talk</a>) 21:21, 21 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>This of course is not an admin issue, but more eyes are certainly welcome, both at the AfD and in helping to improve the article itself.  I&#39;m all for improving the sourcing of the article, which will benefit from additional scrutiny.  The issue of what can accurately be called a &#34;common misconception&#34; can also be solved through improved sourcing.  Bali ultimate is thankfully aware that nothing should be deleted simply on the basis that it is unsourced (BLPs being a notable exception).--<a href="" title="User:Father Goose">Father Goose</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Father Goose">talk</a>) 22:03, 21 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>No, don&#39;t unilaterally remove entries, move them to the talk page of the article for people to reference. That way nothing is lost but sourcing is still enforced. - <a href="" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic">&#60;sup&#62;(talk)&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 22:05, 21 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>
<dl>
<dd>Just a clarification -- I believe almost everything that is unsourced should be deleted (BLP&#39;s are simply more urgent). The presence of unsourced content degrades the encyclopedia (by creating the impression wikipedia does not enforce basic standards). However, i&#39;m well aware that edit warring to get that done is inappropriate (if i thought moves to the talk page would also not be reverted, i would do that of course).<a href="" title="User:Bali ultimate">Bali ultimate</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Bali ultimate">talk</a>) 22:07, 21 March 2009 (UTC)

The third wasn&#39;t working for him as indicated in his next summary so it is still a good faith edit. Yamanam is also right that there is no mention of blindness in any of the sources</a> Again, he removed another sneaky vandalism.</li></ul>

<dd>Ugh, this is not the place Yam. You have a dispute make your own section. One of the sources said 400+ were killed, however the language was actually referring the Hamas/Fatah battle a couple of years ago. The article didn&#39;t make that explicitly clear and during that time there weren&#39;t many sources to verify # casualties. Falastine, you didn&#39;t respond to what I said. I don&#39;t care about your opinion, really I don&#39;t. I&#39;m saying this so you can end the baiting, because you won&#39;t get a response. :D Yam, disputes such as these must be made in the talk section. It is clear your reasoning is flawed and based on POV-pushing. You have a lengthy history of removing cited information, claiming to follow the process (i.e, per talk) but instead go your own way according to a partisan agenda. Here, check the history: <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2009_Hamas_reprisal_attacks&#38;action=history" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2009_Hamas_reprisal_attacks&#38;action=history">2 other editors removed Yam&#39;s vandalism</a>. this isn&#39;t a POV fued, Yam is a textbook vandal trying to dig his way out of a hole.

I looked over <a href="" title="WP:BLOCK">WP:BLOCK</a> but couldn&#39;t find anything concrete, so I was wanting a second opinion. <a href="" title="User:OverlordQ">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#171788;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;Q&#60;/span&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:OverlordQ">T</a> <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/OverlordQ">C</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 10:02, 22 March 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>To clarify. User:Spongebob&#39;s real name is JimDoe. A recent sock created the account User:JimDoe and preformed personal attacks against Jim.  Jim then came to ACC to request an account that is a variation of JimDoe, and furthermore that it be indef&#39;d to keep the sock from creating the account and continuing their personal attacks. They still want to edit under their pseudonym, and don&#39;t want a name change. <a href="" title="User:OverlordQ">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#171788;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;Q&#60;/span&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:OverlordQ">T</a> <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/OverlordQ">C</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 13:36, 22 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>If I read the discussion correctly, only the nominator and one other commenter gave solid reasons. That is too little for consensus making and the sockpuppetry may well have scared off other commenters.

<ul>
<li>Which would be fine, except the fair use rationale for <a href="" title="File:Travis the chimp.png">File:Travis the chimp.png</a> is incorrect. It states that the image is not replaceable by a free one, which is clearly false as given the subject, there is clearly a high possibility that a free image could be found.  On a separate issue, &#34;Yes to fair use&#34; actually makes <i>less sense</i>.  Wikipedia is a <i>free</i> encyclopedia. As soon as you use a fair use image in an article, it makes the article unable to be re-used in many jurisdictions as it will involve a copyright violation. &#60;b&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Black Kite">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;Black Kite&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/b&#62; 16:17, 22 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s reasonable to expect volunteers to get a shovel to produce a free image.  In any event, any use that&#39;s anywhere near our requirements don&#39;t make re-use any more difficult than it already is, unless the re-use is highly transformative.

<ul>
<li>Let&#39;s be reasonable about it though; some subjects are going to be horribly difficult to find a free image of.

<dd>This is a clear example of abuse of the template- that template should be used for articles on the film only.   is fine to use for an album cover on an album article, but it is no good to add that template then wap the cover into the article on the artist. <a href="" title="User:J Milburn">J Milburn</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:J Milburn">talk</a>) 19:53, 22 March 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>The album cover one makes sense as an album cover is almost certainly going to be relevant in the article about the album, but this is basically a blanket approval for any film screenshot, regardless of how relevant it is. Even on the article about the film, there&#39;s no guarantee that any random screenshot is going to be relevant enough to pass <a href="" title="WP:NFCC">WP:NFCC</a> #8. &#60;font face=&#34;Broadway&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.</a><a href="" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man"><b><i>Z-</i></b><i>man</i></a>&#60;/font&#62; 22:14, 22 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The problem is that users believe that if they attach a completed FUR to an image, it automatically makes it OK to use in an article.

As per the page their is a difference of opionion between myself and <a href="" title="user:SchuminWeb">user:SchuminWeb</a> over the picture in the infobox. The third party picture which i added to the page has been  repeatedly reverted by the said user, even though the picture (Arlington Cemetery Metro station.jpg) appears to be of superior quality.

The report here may have been filed as part of a campaign to blow up the sun, but that&#39;s not at all what I was talking about. &#60;p&#62; Be careful, by the way, that you don&#39;t come across sounding just like Badagnani. -<a href="" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a>&#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 22:30, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;ll reiterate; <b>The matter has been already discussed</b> at his talk page. There is no need for you to accuse Bulldog123 of being a <i>jerk</i> for the signature.

<dd>I didn&#39;t accuse Bulldog123 of being a jerk. I said that if his goal isn&#39;t to be a jerk, then he ought to link to his user page. I fully assume his goal is <b>not</b> to be a jerk, and that he&#39;ll therefore realize that it&#39;s helpful to include the link, and include it. I also respect him enough that I brought the matter directly to him on his talk page, with a direct question. If there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing, I&#39;m sure he&#39;ll apprise me of that. &#60;p&#62; You might as well know, given recent history, that I&#39;m already watching Badagnani&#39;s contributions, and that when I say &#34;come across sounding like Badagnani,&#34; I mean making these accusations, rather that handling disputes in a different manner.

<dd>Because my AGF to Badagnani is really dried up after my good faith advice on OTRS image failed. (ironically the user has been still following almost every my edits to cuisine articles) I am also disturbed by his attempt to divert from his various problems on the spot light.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="New_mail_handling_procedure">New mail handling procedure</span></h2>

<p>The Arbitration Committee receives a substantial amount of e-mail each day on its mailing list, arbcom-l.  To streamline the process of handling arbcom-l traffic and improve response times, the Committee has adopted a new <a href="#Handling_incoming_mail" title="WP:AC/PR">procedure for handling incoming mail</a>, which supersedes the current mailing list coordinator position.</p>
<p>The procedure was adopted by a 13/0 vote, with no abstentions:

<li>Abstain: None</li>
<li>Not voting: Cool Hand Luke, Stephen Bain, Wizardman</li></ul>

<p>The Committee wishes to thank Deskana for his diligence as mailing list coordinator over the past three months.

<p>One of the Arbitration Committee&#39;s responsibilities is to address appeals received via e-mail from banned or long-term blocked users.  To improve the level of attention and response time for these requests, the Committee has formed a Ban Appeals Subcommittee, which will consist of three arbitrators.  This subcommittee will consider ban appeals and recommend actions regarding them to the Committee as a whole, as outlined in the newly adopted <a href="#Handling_ban_appeals" title="WP:AC/PR">procedure for handling ban appeals</a>.  </p>
<p>The subcommittee was created by a 15/0 vote, with no abstentions:

<dd>IP vandals should <i>never</i> be blocked indef and rarely long term, instead they should blocked based on the nature of the assignment of their IP address. Five year blocks are only really suitable for open CGI proxies on static professionally hosted server IPs. I tend to use this option a lot, but I don&#39;t think it should be a generally available option as these are rarely correctly identified, and many open proxies are not of this type. It&#39;s very rarely suitable for other types of block. -- <a href="" title="user:zzuuzz">zzuuzz</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="user_talk:zzuuzz">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 22:11, 22 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Simply because they do not remain open proxies indefinitely. The vast majority of open proxies IPs are not open proxies after only a few months. This is especially true for Tor proxies, zombies, vandalbots, spambots, and misconfigured squids. One of two things happens: either the IP is reassigned (see <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_on_open_proxies/Archive_2#Dynamic_IPs" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_on_open_proxies/Archive_2#Dynamic_IPs"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_on_open_proxies/Archive_2#Dynamic_IPs" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_on_open_proxies/Archive_2#Dynamic_IPs">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:WikiProject_on_open_proxies/Archive_2#Dynamic_IPs</a></a>), or the proxy gets closed and the IP is no longer available to abusive users. The same logic applies to normal IP vandals, including the ones used for sockpuppetry or death threats. Even professionally hosted server IPs get reused after some time; they can also be blocked longer because they are likely to remain relatively static but the collateral is likely to be less. -- <a href="" title="user:zzuuzz">zzuuzz</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="user_talk:zzuuzz">(talk)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 09:55, 23 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Personally, I think Pedro&#39;s option mentioned above should be in the dropdown menu as well.  <a href="" title="User:Keeper76">&#60;font color=&#34;#21421E&#34; face=&#34;comic sans ms&#34;&#62;Keeper&#60;/font&#62;</a> | <a href="" title="User talk:Keeper76">&#60;font color=&#34;#CC7722&#34; face=&#34;Papyrus&#34;&#62;76&#60;/font&#62;</a> 03:13, 23 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>&#34;Necessary&#34; I don&#39;t know about. &#34;Useful&#34; yes; approprite to have as an option, I think so.  I&#39;ve been an admin since early &#39;03, and sometimes put repeat vandal ips on my watchlist. I&#39;ve had some ips go from 1 day block through the gradual steps to 1 year block-- and then come back vandalizing more each time the block expires. There are ip#s that have been vandalizing for <i>years</i> whenever they&#39;re not blocked. Policy is not to indef block non-proxy ip#s. If the vandal ip# vandalizes yet again after the second year long block expires, why not give &#39;em 5 years time out?   -- <a href="" title="User:Infrogmation">Infrogmation</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Infrogmation">talk</a>) 04:39, 23 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>Well, the gods might consider it to be hubris. Otherwise, I can&#39;t think why not. -<a href="" title="User:GTBacchus">GTBacchus</a>&#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:GTBacchus">talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 05:36, 23 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>It all depends from what one thinks the mathematical progression actually is.  I made a 1 year block of an IP address not so long ago (for persistent vandalism over a period of 4 months, starting up where xe had left off each time the prior block expired), and I noticed in the block log that the account had exactly followed the pattern 1 day&#38;mdash;1 week&#38;mdash;1 month&#38;mdash;1 year.  The next mathematically logical length in succession after that would be 1 decade.  &#38;#9786; <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 22:02, 23 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li>Of course, use of this option would be very rare, but I don&#39;t see why its existence is problematic. Heh, this&#39;ll shock you - in 2007, I think it was possibly to block someone for up to 38 years. &#38;mdash;&#60;strong&#62;<a href="" title="User:Anonymous Dissident">&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Script MT Bold;color:DarkRed&#34;&#62;Anonymous Dissident&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/strong&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:Anonymous Dissident">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-family:Verdana;color:Gray&#34;&#62;Talk&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 06:45, 23 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You can do that today as well, AFAIK, there is no upper limit on the &#34;other time&#34; option.  If you want to block for any arbitrary time, you can... --<a href="" title="User:Jayron32">Jayron32</a>.<a href="" title="User talk:Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;talk&#60;/small&#62;</a>.<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Jayron32">&#60;small&#62;contribs&#60;/small&#62;</a> 17:20, 23 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>


<ul>
<li>As long as administrators generally know that the 5 year option should only be used for open proxies, I don&#39;t see a problem leaving it in there for the convenience of admins who work on rooting out those same open proxies. –&#60;font face=&#34;Verdana&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<b>xeno</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/font&#62; 17:30, 23 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Agreed. I am not knowledgeable enough on open proxies to make the determination so I avoid those and have never used the 5yr option (but was tempted once on a returning two timer for two consecutive 1yr blocks). Leave it there. -- <a href="" title="User:Alexf">Alexf</a>&#60;sup&#62;&#60;i&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Alexf">(talk)</a>&#60;/i&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 17:38, 23 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Don&#39;t forget that we block named accounts as well as IP addresses.  So only looking at it from the point of view of whether it is appropriate for IP addresses is missing half of the potential uses for the drop-down list item. <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 22:02, 23 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>I&#39;ve blocked a few school IPs who vandalized right off one-year blocks for five years, and I haven&#39;t had anyone complain. I really don&#39;t see a problem with doing this to fixed IPs that only vandalize over and over again ... I think using longer blocks on school IPs has measurably reduced the vandalism we deal with. And some admins were already doing this before the &#34;5 years&#34; option began appearing in the dropdown box months ago. If you want the five year option to be available only for open proxies, have the block page say so because I don&#39;t think a lot of admins, especially those of us who are out at the front, know this. Or better yet, take it out of the dropdown box entirely, or limit the maximum block time to a year. As it is, there&#39;s nothing to let people know it&#39;s intended only for open proxies. <a href="" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Daniel Case">talk</a>) 15:52, 24 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Notification_of_second_injunction_relating_to_RFAR.2FMZMcBride">Notification of second injunction relating to RFAR/MZMcBride</span></h2>

<p>The <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration Committee">Arbitration Committee</a>, in <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/MZMcBride">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/MZMcBride</a>, have voted to implement a <a href="#Injunctions" title="Wikipedia:Arbitration policy">temporary injunction</a>. It can be viewed on the case page by following <a href="#Temporary_injunction.28s.29:" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/MZMcBride">this link</a>. The injunction is as follows:
&#60;blockquote&#62;The Arbitration Committee previously adopted <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/MZMcBride/Proposed_decision#Proposed_temporary_injunctions" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/MZMcBride/Proposed_decision#Proposed_temporary_injunctions">an injunction</a> passed on March 6, 2009, directing MZMcBride to refrain from using automated tools such as bots or scripts to delete pages while the case was pending. The purpose of this injunction was to allow time for the committee to address issues concerning MZMcBride&#39;s mass deletions of pages, which have been controversial and which some participants in this case have alleged violate policy.&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
<p>&#60;blockquote&#62;Since the injunction was adopted, MZMcBride has deleted hundreds of additional pages, sometimes at a rate of dozens of pages per minute. MZMcBride has explained several times that these deletions have been effectuated using tabbed browsing, rather than by a bot or script. However, at least some of the concerns regarding the mass deletions remain the same as those covered by the injunction.&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
<p>&#60;blockquote&#62;Accordingly, MZMcBride is directed to refrain from deleting pages while this case remains pending, with the exception of obvious attack, nonsense, or vandalism pages. There is no restriction against his proposing lists of pages to be deleted by other administrators, provided that the deleting administrator exercises his or her own judgment in determining that deletion is appropriate.&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
<p>&#60;blockquote&#62;This temporary injunction shall take effect immediately and shall remain in effect until the case is closed. It does not reflect any prejudgment of the merits of the case. The committee shall take reasonable steps to expedite the resolution of this case, thereby producing a final decision that will supersede this and the prior temporary injunction.&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="PD_review">PD review</span></h2>

<p>This started as a result of image reviewing at <a href="" title="en:Wikipedia:Featured list candidates">Featured List Candidates</a> on en wiki but I know it&#39;s  a problem other places. This is directed at a general situation, not at any person. Why do we have to reverify an image&#39;s PD status because of something like links changing? If it was PD, it&#39;s always PD. It does not lose that legal status because some website dropped off the net and User:JoeBlow can&#39;t find it anymore. But as it is, there is a trend to say &#34;I can&#39;t find it, so you have to prove it even though we all know it was PD&#34;. Here I&#39;m talking cases like it was sourced to a known PD site or even just trusting the uploader didn&#39;t invent a URL, but no, we say &#34;the guy could have been faking a URL, so prove it again, to me&#34;. This is all unnecessary and avoidable by using a method that is used on Commons where trusted users verify a flickr image&#39;s status for Commons; it&#39;s called Flickr review. We could have &#34;PD review&#34;, where trusted users verify a PD status and tag the image with a template. That way, two years later when User:JaneBlow posts a FLC/FAC, etc, you, me, and others don&#39;t waste our time reinventing the wheel. Not to mention a known PD image can&#39;t be used anymore because a URL changed or whatever. Do we do this with images from books? Not yet, but we probably will...Do we say &#34;I don&#39;t own that book and it&#39;s not in my local library so you have to prove it&#39;s PD from 1900 by sending me the book&#34;, nope we don&#39;t yet, but that&#39;s basically what we do with images. Obviously, I&#39;m not talking cases such as when the uploader didn&#39;t source the image at all. Food for thought.

I came across a bunch of indefinitely blocked IP addresses blocked with the templated reason   and as far as I can tell these were not OTRS requests. I think they should be unblocked as they&#39;ve been in place since 2007. No prejudice to reblocking with an expiry if they resume vandalism. This came up because of a seemingly good faith request here: <a href="#Long_term_block" title="User_talk:216.120.198.130">User_talk:216.120.198.130</a>. –&#60;font face=&#34;Verdana&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<b>xeno</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Xeno">&#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;talk&#60;/font&#62;</a>)&#60;/font&#62; 14:40, 24 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>The template is a <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Navigation template">navigation template</a>, and as such should be located at the end of the article with the others, per the footer navbox guidelines; however, the IP user has been inserting them into a subsection in the body of the article.

<p>I appreciate this person&#39;s enthusiasm, and I&#39;ve tried to contact him/her several times on the IP&#39;s talk page, but I&#39;ve been ignored — the edits continue without any change.

<dd>An editor came to the project page saying that Erik9 was basically spamming articles&#39; &#34;See also&#34; section with links to pages that were not directly related to the articles in question. I actually agreed, and explained on Erik9&#39;s talk page why I reverted his edits. When someone posted a comment on the project page that a discussion had taken place at one of the templates for deletion, and that there was a move to start including those types of links in the &#34;See also&#34; section I stopped what I was doing (I wasn&#39;t aware of said deletion discussion or outcome). Since then, a discussion has been underway as to what links really are relevant to the &#34;See also&#34; section, and what ones are better left for the &#34;Categories&#34;. I did not revert all of Erik&#39;s edits, and given that this was not some widespread consensus to include those links (i.e. there was no &#34;See Also&#34; section at <a href="" title="WP:MOSFILMS">WP:MOSFILMS</a>) amended, so I stuck to the general <a href="" title="WP:SEEALSO">WP:SEEALSO</a> guides), it would have been beneficial for Erik9 to at least notify the film community of his intentions (given the fact that just about every film article page did not have said links before he added them). The &#34;rollback&#34; was used the same as an &#34;undo&#34; would have, except given his mass edits it was merely the quicker option - hence why I contacted him directly on the matter about it. That&#39;s all I have to say about it, the decision is whatever the decision is. Cheers. <a href="" title="User:Bignole">&#60;small&#62;<b>&#60;span style=&#34;background:Maroon;color:Gold&#34;&#62; &#38;nbsp;BIGNOLE&#38;nbsp;&#60;/span&#62;</b>&#60;/small&#62;</a>  <a href="" title="User talk:Bignole">&#60;small&#62;(Contact me)&#60;/small&#62;</a> 23:36, 24 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Confirmed to be deliberate introduction of incorrect information in at least a few cases. Given the account&#39;s past history and the nature of the edits, I think it&#39;s safe to assume that the rest are also vandalism.

<dd>Confirmed to be deliberate introduction of incorrect information in at least a few cases. Given the account&#39;s past history and the nature of the edits, I think it&#39;s safe to assume that the rest are also vandalism. I re-blocked for 6 months (the previous block length was one month) and will rollback all edits by the account. –<b><a href="" title="User:Black Falcon">Black Falcon</a></b> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Black Falcon">Talk</a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 04:35, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Putting_biographies_in_Category:Living_people">Putting biographies in <a href="" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a></span></h2>

<p>There are about 30,000 biographies that are not in <a href="" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> that need to be examined and put into the category if necessary. The false positive rate is about 1 out of 3. There&#39;s no way to automate this&#38;mdash;it requires human checking. I&#39;ve been using <a href="" title="WP:AWB">AWB</a> to add some of the pages to the category, but it&#39;s simply too monotonous for me.</p>
<p>Generally I would just release the list, however, I don&#39;t want people to duplicate each other&#39;s work by checking the same pages. If anyone is interested or knows anyone interested, please feel free to post here. Even taking a section of the alphabet to check (like all of the Y biographies or something) would be incredibly helpful.

<dd>If you do this, and you come across any that are unsourced (but not negative), please tag them with BLPunsourced as well.

<dd>MZMcBride, my suggestion to you is to post a list in project space somewhere that has sections, perhaps 100 items to a section and then invite people to take on a section or two. If you have to put it on more then one page that is ok :). I&#39;ll do a section if you do this.

<p>Where do we find the 30,000 biographies?  i.e. is there a way to run AWB on &#34;People whose living status is not known&#34;, or better yet &#34;People whose living stauts is not known, but are likely to be living.&#34; &#60;span style=&#34;font-variant:small-caps&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Jayvdb">John Vandenberg</a> &#60;sup&#62;<b>(<a href="" title="User talk:Jayvdb">chat</a>)</b>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/span&#62; 08:25, 25 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

And all pages in <a href="" title="Category:Living people">Category:Living people</a> and <a href="" title="Category:Possibly living people">Category:Possibly living people</a> were excluded (or at least they should be).

<p>Ok, I&#39;ve went ahead and wrote a script that translated the file on toolserver into something readable and workable with here on wikipedia. I&#39;ve separated the list into 8 wikipedia pages with sections of 100 articles each. Ideally folks will take a section or two and categorize them as appropriate. Given time this should be done.

<dd>Based on my sample of 100, 3/4  <b><i>needed</i></b> categorisation.</dd>
<dd>That is definitely a high enough hit rate to warrant people working off this list.  Thanks MZMcBride.  Hopefully everyone feels very motivated to grab a hundred and do their fair share.</dd>
<dd>Can we have a weekly update?  If we reduce the false positive rate, and find the percentage needing to be categorised into Living people is approaching 90%, I would support adding the category to all the remaining pages without the bot flag, and allowing surprised editors to remove the category if it doesnt apply.</dd>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Proposal_for_unban.2C_apology.2C_amnesty_for_Jvolkblum_and_related_others.2C_and_topic_ban_for_Orlady">Proposal for unban, apology, amnesty for Jvolkblum and related others, and topic ban for Orlady</span></h2>

<p> </p>
<p>This is a quick summary of a proposal to settle a long-running war in the wikipedia articles relating to New Rochelle, New York and surrounding areas.  Briefly I propose:
</p>
<ol>
<li>that the community unban <a href="" title="User:Jvolkblum">User:Jvolkblum</a></li>
<li>that the community provide an amnesty to all users who have been blocked in the case, who promise to edit from one account going forward</li>
<li>that the community apologize to any users caught up in the mess unfairly</li>
<li>that <a href="" title="User:Orlady">User:Orlady</a> be given a one year topic ban preventing her from editing articles in the New Rochelle area</li></ol>
<p>I believe these 4 actions would go far to settle a bad situation, and to allow a wikipedia community to take hold that would build and maintain New Rochelle area articles.  I am told that the extended sockpuppet case associated here is the largest ever in wikipedia.</p>
<p><a href="" title="New Rochelle, New York">New Rochelle, New York</a> is an affluent city facing out onto Long Island Sound, just outside New York City limits, with good commuter rail service into Manhattan.  Possibly for NYC tax avoidance reasons, and for many other reasons, it has more historic sites, more internet usage, and more new wikipedia editors than most similarly sized communities.  A great amount of local history documents including at least one Ph.D. dissertation have been written about the area, providing material for local users, not all available on-line.  New Rochelle is a compact geographical area with a university, one or just a few Kinkos, libraries, and other public internet access points, and it is quite likely that different persons caught up in this by their interest in New Rochelle articles would sometimes show the same IP address as others, perhaps making checkuser investigations difficult.</p>
<p><i>Background, quickly (my perspective)</i>:  The war started with edits by <a href="" title="User:Jvolkblum">User:Jvolkblum</a> who was community banned for creating multiple accounts and using them in sock-puppetry.  I believe this person is long gone, no longer involved in Wikipedia editing.  It is not necessary to go into the exact facts and fairness or unfairness of that original ban.  Call that person New Rochelle area Person &#34;A&#34;.  There has been intense watchlisting and enforcement of this ban.  Since then, there have been multiple new wikipedia users Person &#34;B&#34;, &#34;C&#34;, &#34;D&#34;, etc. from, or interested in, the New Rochelle area who have edited articles only to encounter harsh and unfair treatment, including abrupt and rude deletion of their contributions, and often the application of unjustified blocks on their accounts.  I count myself in that number, having had edits deleted and experiencing deletion of several articles which I had created or contributed to.  As an experienced wikipedia user with plenty of track record elsewhere, I have not been accused of being a sockpuppet and banned, however.  Principal enforcing editors have included <a href="" title="User:Wknight94">User:Wknight94</a> and <a href="" title="User:Orlady">User:Orlady</a>, &#34;W&#34; and &#34;O&#34;.  W is no longer active, and has given up adminship.  O is not an administrator but has been the most active enforcing the ban and watching the New Rochelle articles recently and probably for the last year.  </p>
<p>The reasoning for harsh treatment of New Rochelle-interested editors has often been extremely sloppy, in my view:  a person is deemed to be a sock-puppet of a banned user essentially if they show any persistent interest in New Rochelle area articles.  A vicious cycle has ensued, in which some blocked users have created new accounts and tried editing again.  They may observe that they are not banned, as they are not the banned Person A, and/or they may be simply interested in getting some material about New Rochelle into the wikipedia.  Sockuser investigations have been applied to establish that the new accounts are associated with previous accounts caught up in this and in some cases used to justify new blocks.  Recently, while I have been watchlisting New Rochelle area articles, a Person &#34;G&#34; and a person &#34;H&#34; have been involved editing and have had accounts linked in and banned.  Person G is relatively more interested in Geography matters such as articles about neighborhoods and islands.  Person H is relatively more interested in History matters, such as describing the NRHP-listed historic sites in the area.  As one or both of these persons is not the original person A, they have not both been banned by the community.  At least one has been unfairly linked in and treated as banned, with their contributions deleted.  I believe that Orlady in particular recognizes that there are multiple persons involved, and has shown a reckless disregard for that fact.  In edit summaries, AfD proposals, and requests for bans, she has knowingly unfairly applied unfair reasoning to justify reverting edits, deleting articles, and banning users.  A common fallacy in her claims is that she attributes all previous bad behavior by any and all involved, to any current editor, as justification for preemptively deleting new articles and edits.</p>
<p>Two refrains in W and O defending the prosecution of New Rochelle users have been &#34;looks like a duck&#34; and &#34;These are not innocent victims&#34;.  To me, it is obvious that there are different writing styles, different knowledge of wikipedia policies and workings, and different skills and life experience otherwise of the involved persons.  I think this is obvious to O also.  Thus, accusations that they all look the same, duck-like, and must be the original Person A, are obviously false.  That many of the edit contributions are not great is obvious.  O will be able to provide numerous instances of imperfect sourcing, sometimes plagiarism and sometimes copyright violations in material added.  And the opening of new accounts by blocked users has been admitted by them publicly and is obvious.  To some extent, however, these bad actions are caused by the prosecution of the case.  The use of multiple accounts is caused by the unfair blocking of a user who is not the original Person A, who may be simply focused on getting some worthy wikipedia article started.  The prosecution criminalizes their actions.  I hate bad referencing myself, and abhor copyright violations and all that, but I sympathize with the offending users who may simply be trying to get something out there, and who pile on more material in their repeated re-starting of articles, in order to respond to previous harsh treatment that they do not understand.  Deleting articles on the basis that notability has not been established will tend to lead to re-creations with stronger claims.  Then the articles are deleted for being too long, and including arguably trivial material.  Deleting articles and edits on the basis that source attributions are not perfect, may have the unfortunate tendency of reinforcing quick paste-ins:  why bother to construct careful footnotes, if the whole thing is subject to deletion?  When specific footnotes are added but the source is not available on-line, the contributions are deleted anyhow.  I believe that one or more of the users thinks that wikipedia enforcers are hypocritical and in violation of site policies, and that plays into their choices to violate site policies as well.  I suspect that one or more of the users has played an extended game to provoke W and O.  So, they aren&#39;t ducks, and they eventually are not innocent.</p>
<p><i>Disclaimer about O and me</i>:  I have had running disputes with user Orlady over various matters, including that I regard her opposition as having succeeded in derailing a Featured List nomination of mine that would otherwise have been accepted.  I also have communicated to her that I believe she has detrimentally affected the <a href="" title="wp:NRHP">wp:NRHP</a> community of editors.  When I think about some actions taken and words written by Orlady regarding my work and my opinions in wikipedia, I can start to get angry.  Eventually, however, I came to understand that Orlady&#39;s actions vis-a-vis me, which I experienced as harsh and sometimes vindictive, were not as personally attacking against me as I had first thought.  I came to believe, instead, that she seems to treat many people in wikipedia similarly.  The bad experiences I had with Orlady allowed me to empathize with the New Rochelle area users, gave me interest to get involved and allowed me to have some good communications with some involved in the case.  If requested, I can detail some of this past history between O and me.  Evidence of other good wikipedia editors&#39; frustration with O is expressed in O&#39;s Talk page and archives thereof.  Nonetheless, I have basic respect for Orlady, I believe that her edits have contributed to wikipedia, and I enjoy, to some extent, sparring with her about minor content and wording issues in obscure wikipedia articles.  I think i am a better wikipedia editor for her involvement.</p>

<p>My principal goal is to allow new, or effectively new and inexperienced wikipedia users in the New Rochelle area to edit under one account in wikipedia.  User G, in communications on my talk page, has agreed to edit from just one account.  The technical unban of Person A, and the amnesty of G and any other NR users who request a single account, is necessary to allow these users to channel their good energy productively, and to permit efficient supervision.  To apologize to the ones unfairly treated is simple decency.  Perhaps an apology can be presented as a kind of petition.  Banning O from editing in this area is needed, in my view, to remove her from involvement that would continue to inhibit development of a good community of NR area wikipedia editors.  With these measures together, i think the biggest sockpuppet case in wikipedia can be brought towards closure.</p>

<dd>Doncram, you posted this: <i>&#34;The reasoning for harsh treatment of New Rochelle-interested editors has often been extremely sloppy, in my view: a person is deemed to be a sock-puppet of a banned user essentially if they show any persistent interest in New Rochelle area articles.&#34;</i>. </dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>This line of argument is a common claim or misconception; in fact it&#39;s as often used in bad faith (to try and allege a block was improper) as not. If you look at the past actions, you&#39;ll find that a number of sock checks were undertaken not by people &#34;guessing&#34;, but by <a href="" title="WP:CHECK">checkusers</a> with access to the server records. There may be many editors in this town (as with many cities, universities, or other IPs), but the basic premise of your view is a complete misconception, as checkusers address such cases very differently. They can examine and verify considerably more data, including the server logs of edits, and a range of other possibly related or affected editorial activity by the same or other users. </dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>As a recent checkuser on this case I can confirm that <a href="#Report_date_February_23_2009.2C_05:21_.28UTC.29" title="Wikipedia:Sockpuppet investigations/Jvolkblum/Archive">the socks of February 23-24</a> are exactly that - extremely likely (&#34;confirmed&#34;) to be socks of the same person, where this is stated, and fairly likely to be socks of the same person where <i>that</i> is stated. The terms &#34;confirmed&#34; and &#34;fairly likely&#34; are used within the norms of the community: that is, it is with an extremely high degree of likelihood <b>not</b> just &#34;someone in the area&#34;, <b>not</b> just &#34;someone at the same school&#34; or &#34;using the same library or store&#34;, <b>not</b> just &#34;someone who by coincidence has similar data&#34;, but the <b>same</b> person or <b>at worst</b> someone extremely closely connected to them, who is treated as in effect co-editing, or editing on their behalf. There is no absolte certainty, but we can often be pretty sure in findings. If you would like another checkuser to recheck this for you, let me know.</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Turning next to Orlady, what exactly are the proposed grounds for a &#34;ban&#34;. As best I can see the user has accurately targeted socks of a banned user, for others to examine, on several occasions. If there is a good basis for this request, probably you need to present it.</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I see it a others have above. This is a prolific, current, hardened sock user and edit warrior, and frankly in view of the history, seems somewhat unlikely to reform into a high quality editor any time soon. If I were asked, I would therefore endorse keeping the status quo. <a href="" title="user:FT2">FT2</a>&#38;nbsp;&#60;sup&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;font-style:italic&#34;&#62;(<a href="" title="User_talk:FT2">Talk</a>&#38;nbsp;|&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="Special:Emailuser/FT2">email</a>)&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 01:11, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Obviously I do not support a &#34;ban&#34; on me. As for the proposed grounds for a ban, I believe that the fundamental reason wny Doncram has requested that I be banned is what&#39;s described in his statement: He doesn&#39;t like me (apparently primarily because I opposed <a href="" title="WP:Featured list">WP:Featured list</a> status for a list he had created), because he is inclined to think that &#34;the enemy of my enemy must be friend&#34; he has found common cause with some Jvolkblum socks who he perceives are victims of bullying by me, and he is asking to have the bully banned from the schoolyard. --<a href="" title="User:Orlady">Orlady</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Orlady">talk</a>) 03:13, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I&#39;ve been handling Jvolkblum CUs for months now and I maintain that the IP/ISP/location pattern has not changed. I only suggested that it was possible that we were dealing with two Jvolkblum-like editors because of the sheer number of socks I found. From that alone, Doncram began pushing for the possibility that instead of Jvolkblum, I had been blocking dozens of innocent editors from the New Rochelle area. Jvolkblum, in his early manifestations, never operated from one location. He was good at bypassing IP blocks because he had widespread Internet access in New York City and at his home. The socks that I catch even now all originate from the same ISPs and locations of the original Jvolkblum socks, and they also share a penchant for using multiple open proxies (sometimes, I&#39;ve discovered socks on the same open proxy months apart). As for Orlady, I believe she deserves great praise for her persistence and diligence in preventing a banned user from further disrupting Wikipedia. &#60;span style=&#34;background:white;color:#007FFF;font-family:Georgia;&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Nishkid64">Nishkid64</a> &#60;/span&#62;&#60;sub&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Nishkid64">Make articles, not wikidrama</a>)&#60;/sub&#62; 01:20, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>&#60;- If we do anything other than what we&#39;re doing now.. How about we leave Jvolkblum banned and <b>forget about him</b>. Then we can deal with new editors involved in these articles based on the nature &#38; quality of their editing behavior and not on how they resemble the edits of the blocked guy.. Except in very unique circumstances (most of which involve WP:OFFICE) there comes a point in time when continuing to sockhunt becomes more disruptive to the project than the behavior that caused the original user to be banned. Not sure if we&#39;ve reach that point in this case, but it&#39;s worth thinking about  --<a href="" title="User:Versageek">&#60;span style=&#34;color:midnightblue&#34;&#62;Versa&#60;/span&#62;</a><a href="" title="User_talk:Versageek">&#60;span style=&#34;color:darkred&#34;&#62;geek&#60;/span&#62;</a> 01:23, 26 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I thoroughly sympathize with the suggestion that we &#34;forget about&#34; Jvolkblum and give newly registered users free reign in New Rochelle (and other topics of interest to Jvolkblum), but ignoring him will not make him go away. It&#39;s clear that Jvolkblum enjoys the game of whack-a-mole, but experience indicates that this user would continue to disrupt Wikipedia even if nobody reacted to his/her disruptions. For a period of several weeks in 2008 I slacked off on New Rochelle for a little while, and my period of inattention led to an extremely complex and labor-intensive checkuser process that netted something like 66 registered sockpuppet accounts (see <a href="#Jvolkblum_9" title="Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Jvolkblum">Wikipedia:Requests for checkuser/Case/Jvolkblum</a>), plus myriad articles that had been tainted by these users&#39; contributions. --<a href="" title="User:Orlady">Orlady</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Orlady">talk</a>) 03:35, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Many thanks to the CUs who have commented. Orlady isn&#39;t an admin, which means all of these blocks have been done by administrators who at the least have reviewed evidence she found and found block-worthy behavior. And then there are the half dozen checkusers who has also looked at the edits and found blockworthy behavior. Far from being an isolated group of people attacking an editor, this is one of the most diverse groups of individuals who have tackled this case. I see no reason to support an unban of Jvolkblum, he certainly hasn&#39;t asked to be unbanned and usually unbans are only done when someone seeks to be unbanned. And I see no reason to sanction Orlady who is just helping protect article and who does an excellent job at DYK. <b><a href="" title="User:MBisanz">&#60;span style=&#39;color: #FFFF00;background-color: #0000FF;&#39;&#62;MBisanz&#60;/span&#62;</a></b> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:MBisanz">&#60;span style=&#39;color: #FFA500;&#39;&#62;talk&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 01:25, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>We don&#39;t need to unban  .  I think we&#39;ve already figured out that he was writing poorly referenced articles, plagiarizing copyrighted material, inserting deliberately false content, and whatever else he did that got him banned in the first place.  As far as the New Rochelle content is concerned, specifically, we need to continue to be vigilant about it.  In fact, anyone who adds anything about New Rochelle sites and who isn&#39;t already an experienced, well-trusted user should be treated with extreme suspicion.

<dd>Would Wikipedia be terribly incomplete if it lacked any articles about places in New Rochelle?  I don&#39;t think so.  We don&#39;t have a single article on <a href="" title="National Register of Historic Places listings in Stearns County, Minnesota">anything in St. Cloud, Minnesota</a>, and nobody has been calling the Wikipedia help desk and demanding that we start articles on those places.  The damage to Wikipedia by Jvolkblum far exceeds the incompleteness of missing those articles.  (Much in the same way that my admin fiasco in January, in which I lost adminship because I couldn&#39;t moderate a debate between professional wrestling fans, obviates any progress I&#39;ve ever made in writing NRHP articles in Minnesota.  Besides, nobody cares about those articles anyway.) I think we should salt the earth as far as anything in New Rochelle is concerned. --<a href="" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 02:23, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>That&#39;s way off. New Rochelle is very notable, and whether its constituent article topics are notable, well-written, well-referenced, or copyvio should be taken on a case-by-case basis. While evidence of a pattern of editing may be a reason to run a checkuser, New Rochelle isn&#39;t in and of itself a valid pretense for anything. It&#39;s a big city in a huge metropolitan area and we should expect many unrelated editors to be involved in editing it and related topics. <b><a href="" title="User:Andrevan">Andre</a></b> (<a href="" title="User_talk:Andrevan">talk</a>) 02:30, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>(ec) Notability aside, Elkman brings up a good point.  What started me deleting all Jvolkblum-created articles sight unseen is that he invariably turns them into wild battlegrounds.  Regardless of whether or not someone takes responsibility for the new articles, each one of them becomes infested with IPs and/or CU-proven socks warring on a variety of issues.  Throw in the penchant for plagiarism and copyvio, etc., and the articles become too much of a liability to keep.  It hasn&#39;t been a popular view, but the quietest the situation has ever been was when I started deleting all of the socks&#39; work.  It&#39;s a proven tactic and sanctioned by <a href="" title="WP:BAN">WP:BAN</a>.  —<a href="" title="User:Wknight94">Wknight94</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wknight94">talk</a>) 02:44, 26 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Why does it count as &#34;improving the encyclopedia&#34; to create articles on obscure historic sites?  A poorly referenced, plagiarized article about a post office in New Rochelle is bad editing and goes against a lot of Wikipedia policies.  Even if those articles are correctly referenced and created by legitimate users, who&#39;s going to bother reading an article about a water tower in <a href="" title="Kanabec County, Minnesota">Kanabec County, Minnesota</a>?  People are more interested in <a href="" title="List of World Wrestling Entertainment employees">who&#39;s wrestling this week</a>.  --<a href="" title="User:Elkman">Elkman</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Elkman">(Elkspeak)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 03:30, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dd>Doncram&#39;s proposal is too sweeping if he just wants to rescue a few innocent users. I notice that he was trying to negotiate with a specific New Rochelle-area user at <a href="#Your_attention_would_help" title="User_talk:Doncram">User_talk:Doncram</a>. That person self-identifies as a grade-school teacher in New Rochelle. If that person were willing to provide additional details about themselves to a checkuser, there might be an opportunity to get them going with a registered account, even though they seem to confess to using open proxies in France to edit Wikipedia. Also somebody would need to check their edit history to see if it was free of Jvolkblum-type problems. Since they are writing to Doncram from a throwaway IP, they would need to reveal some believable data about their past identities. If this is really Jvolkblum, past experience suggests he will be unable to engage in rational dialog, so this is an easy test to perform. <a href="" title="User:EdJohnston">EdJohnston</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:EdJohnston">talk</a>) 03:36, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>As I advised Doncram before he started this discussion, the &#34;specific user&#34; that Doncram has been talking with at <a href="#Your_attention_would_help" title="User_talk:Doncram">User_talk:Doncram</a> (the one he calls &#34;Person G&#34;) is a behavioral &#34;dead ringer&#34; for <a href="" title="User:FlanneryFamily">User:FlanneryFamily</a>, who was the very first Jvolkblum sock I encountered about a year ago.

Both sets of edits are characterized by the sabotaging of wikiformat and the addition of complex external links pointing to online maps and satellite images. The new IP user&#39;s fascination with New Rochelle zip codes was also a characteristic of several Jvolkblum socks (who, among other things, have created articles about zip codes and maps of zip codes). --<a href="" title="User:Orlady">Orlady</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Orlady">talk</a>) 04:51, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Two points; per <a href="" title="WP:SOCK">WP:SOCK</a> if another editor (incidently on the same isp hub) starts editing in the same manner of a banned user within the same subject areas then they are decreed to be socks or meatpuppets, and also in the same regard, before the community apologises to them, these same independent editors who contribute via ip addresses from the same ip hub on the same subjects in the same manner as a banned editor should apologise to the community in acting in such a way to bring suspicion upon themselves - and perhaps they could all, independently, explain why they have not created user accounts so they may edit without the inconvenience of ip blocks... Nah - kudo&#39;s for Doncram&#39;s application of AGF, but I think his trust has been abused in this matter. <a href="" title="User:LessHeard vanU">LessHeard vanU</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:LessHeard vanU">talk</a>) 13:52, 26 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Orlady is one of our best, most scrupulous and fair editors and totally focused on the integrity of our content. I find it very hard to believe she&#39;s ever been abusive in this or any other situation.

<p>Hi there,
I took note of these rules but let me say something.On wikipedia except classical composers who really are sacred monsters of incontestable value(J.S.Bach,Mozart,Beethoven,Mussorgsky,Tchaikovsky,Vivaldi,Rossini,Chopin,R.Strauss)to name just a very few of them and which the world has forgotten them totally and also except american jazz musicians who really are vallue,the rest,most of them who appear on Wikipedia are just normal and bellow the value level.They can prove with tons of papers and cd´s,concerts,mtv´s videos without any value,that they have references,and that can earn millions dollars.One thing can´t they prove:THE REAL VALUE and TALENT that is NONEXISTENT.I know many such persons.All they´ve put on wikipedia is just lies.Except the papers, these people can´t never,ever prove theirs TALENT or if they are suitable for this profession called MUSICIAN,profession that today is rolling in the mud by anyone.
I am from a family of musicians(the real ones),I studied classicaly violin,music theory,harmony and composition(on real),can always prove it,I played all my life only in professional context(studio recording,live concerts,only with best musicians,as jazz instrumentist and many times as classicaly violinist in symphony orchestras).I am also high class arranger - pop,classicaly,jazz).But in Wikipedia´s opinion such musicians do not deserve to be on files.
I don´t mind att all,but I wanted to get aware my opinion about all this shit and don´t forget:I will remain the same professional musician who love and respect my job and who never failed to prostitute for money´s sake.
Thank you for you took your time to read my lines.
M.Ilie
