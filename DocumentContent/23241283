<p> 
<b>Mike</b> (February 1909 – January 1929) was a famous cat who guarded the gates of the <a href="" title="British Museum">British Museum</a> and whose fame was such that <i><a href="" title="Time (magazine)">Time</a></i> magazine devoted two articles to him on his death. <a href="" title="E. A. Wallis Budge">E. A.

<p>The house cat of the Museum taught the young Mike to stalk pigeons by pointing like a dog to the intruder. Under the kitten&#39;s guidance the house cat would proceed to corner the pigeons, daze them, then bring them to the house keeper, who would exchange the bird for a morsel of food and milk, and release them unharmed.&#60;ref name=&#34;time&#34;/&#62;</p>

<p>Mike spent twenty-years at the British Museum during which time he gained a certain notoriety for his <a href="" title="misogynist">misogynist</a> tendencies, pushing away any attempt at fraternisation with females and having a dislike for dogs.  Mike would only allow certain people to feed him, those &#34;<i>who treated him as a man and brother</i>&#34;. Interest in Mike spread such that he was described as &#34;<i>probably the most famed British feline of the 20th Century</i>&#34;.&#60;ref name=&#34;time&#34;/&#62;</p>
<p>As the doyen of <a href="" title="Bloomsbury">Bloomsbury</a> felines the elderly Mike spoke to nobody, and would  only allow the official gatekeeper and Sir Ernest A. Wallis Budge to feed him.&#60;ref name=&#34;time2&#34;&#62;&#34;Foreign News: Cat Mike&#34;, <i>Time</i> magazine, April 8 1929, retrieved 16 June 2009<a class="externallink" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,732230,00.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,732230,00.html"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,732230,00.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,732230,00.html">http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,732230,00.html</a></a>&#60;/ref&#62;</p>
<p>When Mike died Sir Wallis Budge contributed to the <i>Evening Standard</i> an obituary of  Mike which became the basis of his monograph &#34;<i>Mike, the cat who assisted in keeping the main gate of the British Museum from February 1909 to January 1929</i>&#34;. This work includes an ode composed by F. C. W. Hiley which ends:
&#60;blockquote&#62;
Old Mike! Farewell! We all regret you, Although, you  would not let us pet you; Of cats the wisest, oldest best cat, This be  your motto — Requiescat!&#60;ref name=&#34;time&#34;/&#62;
&#60;/blockquote&#62;</p>
<p>Mike&#39;s tombstone was erected near the Great Russell  Street entrance and the inscription reads:  <i>&#34;He assisted in keeping the main gate of the British Museum from February 1909 to January 1929.&#34;</i>&#60;ref name=&#34;time2&#34;/&#62;</p>
