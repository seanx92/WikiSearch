<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Citation_Policy">Citation Policy</span></h2>

<p>I feel like some wikipedians have forgotten the reason why citing articles is important. Citing proves that topics are notable and ensures that information on the article is not false or the result of original research. However, some articles cannot exactly be cited, or are deleted so quickly that the creator does not even get a chance to find a citation that is up to the rigid and bureaucratic standards of many wikipedians. My two examples of this- and I&#39;m sure that there are many more- are two articles about games which were deleted. The first game, called simply &#34;the game&#34; (<a href="" title="The Game (game)">The Game (game)</a>) is a mind game of sorts which has two basic rules: when you are not thinking about it you are winning, and as soon as you think about it you lose. Now just suppose that this game exists (which it clearly does, judging by the number of people who opted to create the article), but no one has bothered to make a scholarly article about it because it is simply a game... there&#39;s no way to cite it but that doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t exist. Another article, which I myself created (<a href="" title="Knocking (card game)">Knocking (card game)</a>) was speedily deleted, without giving me or anyone else a chance to find citations. It is difficult to find citations for folklore-like things such as card-games, since these things are generally passed down by word of mouth and may go by many different names. It may even be possible that this game already has an article, but under a different name, in which case I could rest easy knowing that there is encyclopedic content on it. Neither (<a href="" title="Knocking (card game)">Knocking (card game)</a>) nor (<a href="" title="The Game (game)">The Game (game)</a>) were doing any harm whatsoever. Even if this is simply a case of mass hallucination and neither of these games exist, I feel that the general attitude towards or the rules on citation should change in some way so that the undoubtedly countless other similar articles can be created without creating a huge hassle. We must stop following the letter of the law rather than the spirit. <a href="" title="User:Lord mortekai">Lord mortekai</a> 15:12, 27 September 2007 (UTC)

<dd>As you said, &#34;Citing proves that topics are notable and ensures that information on the article is not false or the result of original research.&#34;  How can we know these games are notable or not original research, if there are no reliable sources whatsoever on them? For all we know, these games were simply made up one day by the authors of the articles. &#38;mdash;&#38;nbsp;Carl &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:CBM">CBM</a>&#38;nbsp;·&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:CBM">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 15:18, 27 September 2007 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, The game you call &#34;knocking&#34; might be <a href="" title="Mao (game)">Mao (game)</a>. Or it might not. &#38;mdash;&#38;nbsp;Carl &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:CBM">CBM</a>&#38;nbsp;·&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:CBM">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 15:22, 27 September 2007 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If a game is truly notable enough to be in an encyclopedia, there will be reliable source references to cite. Number of editors could easily be a bunch of people from the same dorm or high school, and does nothing to verify notability, or discount original research. When I create an article, I try to do it in my sandbox, or create a draft in my user space. I don&#39;t move it into main until reliable sources are cited, and if I cannot find such sources, I don&#39;t move the article to main. If I did, I would have no one else to blame but myself if it got speedy deleted. - <a href="" title="User:Crockspot">Crockspot</a> 16:12, 27 September 2007 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Expansive_question_on_Index-lists">Expansive question on Index-lists</span></h2>

<p>Hi, I&#39;ve got a complex issue, which I&#39;ve drafted a summary of at <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Lists/Index lists">Wikipedia:Lists/Index lists</a>. I&#39;m wondering what the best way to discuss it is. One admin suggested I use a collapsible-box to post it here; would that be acceptable/recommended, and which template should I use? (I&#39;ve started/seen many silent RfCs, so I&#39;m not enamored with that route.)</p>
<p>I&#39;d also appreciate any feedback on how I could explain the issues more clearly, and your initial thoughts on the issue itself, before I put it to a wider audience. Much thanks. -- <a href="" title="User:Quiddity">Quiddity</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Quiddity">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 06:42, 22 November 2007 (UTC)</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Plot_summaries_and_spoilers_decrease_saleability">Plot summaries and spoilers decrease saleability</span></h2>

<p>I have not had real access to a computer in some time so have not been contributing, but I have been reading on my phone, and I am being constantly sickened by the number of articles that deliberately reveal entire plots to readers. <a href="#Story" title="Final Fantasy X">Final Fantasy X</a>, <a href="#Plot_summary" title="Fight Club">Fight Club</a>, <a href="#Plot_synopsis" title="The Sixth Sense">The Sixth Sense</a>. Why is this allowed? If I allowed myself to read <a href="#Story" title="Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations">Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney - Trials and Tribulations</a>, I would have no desire to play the game (which I just bought), and this is a brand-new game. At the very least this content is unencyclopedic, unless specific plot details have a direct impact on real-world notability (at least enough to validate decreasing the product&#39;s market value). Remember, Wikipedia shows up near the top of most Google searches, and this sort of irresponsible editing can easily decrease the subject&#39;s saleability. Can we please put an end to it? ~ <a href="" title="User:JohnnyMrNinja">&#60;font color=&#34;#6699AA&#34;&#62;JohnnyMrNinja&#60;/font&#62;</a> 07:57, 22 November 2007 (UTC)

<dd>Who cares about &#34;saleability&#34;? That&#39;s not Wikipedia&#39;s problem but that of corporations.</dd>
<dd>Anyhow, most films and artworks that have an article in Wikipedia must be somewhat old because otherwise they lack notability. In this sense, they are probably already &#34;sold&#34; by the time somebody writes an article on them. </dd>
<dd>Honestly, I don&#39;t think that an article makes up for watching a film or reading a novel, so hardly can affect the &#34;saleability&#34;.

<dd>The idea of Wikipedia is not in any way whatsoever to increase something&#39;s &#34;saleability&#34;. If something got mainly poor reviews, we&#39;d put that in too, and saleability be goddamned. Our job is to write encyclopedia articles, and those include a synopsis of the <i>full</i> plot. That&#39;s not to say plot summaries should be overlong, they should be a synopsis, not a blow-by-blow, and there are tons out there that could use a good trimming. But one cannot realistically write a decent article on anything from <i><a href="" title="Romeo and Juliet">Romeo and Juliet</a></i> to the latest video game without stating what the thing&#39;s about, and that includes &#34;telling the ending&#34;. If you don&#39;t want to see the ending before you (read the book|watch the movie|play the game), <i>don&#39;t read the article</i> until after you&#39;ve done so! <a href="" title="User:Seraphimblade">Seraphimblade</a> &#60;small&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Seraphimblade">Talk to me</a>&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/small&#62; 08:52, 23 November 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd><a href="" title="IANAL">IANAL</a>, but I believe that the issue is that effect on saleability is one of the measures used to assess whether an unlicensed use of copyright material is reasonable or not.  It could be argued that the 1,200 word plot summary in the <a href="" title="Fight Club">Fight Club</a> article (plus another 1,800 words of character and plot details in the &#39;Characters&#39;, &#39;Motifs&#39; and &#39;Subtexts&#39; sections), for what is only a 200-page book to start with, go beyond legitimate analysis of the copyrighted work, and start to become a copyright violation.  If reading the article conveys enough of the copyrighted work&#39;s content to make readers feel that they don&#39;t need to buy the actual work, that could be one indicator that the article has gone beyond legitimate comment and into copyright violation.  <a href="" title="User:TSP">TSP</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TSP">talk</a>) 14:14, 23 November 2007 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>That&#39;s an interesting point.  A plot summary is the epitome of criticism and commentary.  It&#39;s not clear to me when that crosses the line between copying (for which fair use applies) and merely describing (which is not copying so there&#39;s not even a question of copyright or fair use).  In any event the factor relates to decreasing the market for the original work by replacing it, not decreasing sales by telling people the truth about something.  For example, if I quote a section of a work to demonstrate that it&#39;s racist, or uninformed, or simply poor quality, that may well hurt sales.  If I quote a politician&#39;s speech or an ad campaign to demonstrate that it&#39;s untrue, that may hurt the market purpose of making the speech.  But those are all squarely within uses allowed by fair use, and if the doctrine of fair use did not apply they would be solidly protected as a matter of freedom of speech.  We don&#39;t censor content here simply to avoid hurting sales.  We censor use of non-free content out of a concern for copyrights.  <a href="" title="User:Wikidemo">Wikidemo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wikidemo">talk</a>) 22:27, 23 November 2007 (UTC)

<dd>To quote from WP:EPISODE &#34;...the articles do not exist merely to retell the story (which is classed as a derivative work or a copyright violation) but to provide encyclopaedic information about the creation, production and reception of television programmes. Remember, the article should not attempt to be a replacement for watching the show itself, it should be about the show.&#34; There is some legal history that supports that plot summaries can be copyright violations. I can&#39;t find what the case was because some folks totally rewrote WP:EPISODE without bothering to keep that information, but i&#39;m sure it&#39;s still somewhere in the (talk) archives. It is difficult to draw the line, but for a complicated story as Fight club is at some points, I do not consider its article to cross that line. However, as everyone knows i&#39;m sure, there are/were plot summaries on television episodes that definetly failed at being more than a retelling of the story, and as such could be considered potential copyright violations. --<a href="" title="User:TheDJ">TheDJ</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:TheDJ">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/TheDJ">contribs</a>) 23:51, 30 December 2007 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>To add to Seraphimblade&#39;s statement, I&#39;d like to point out that although <a href="" title="fancruft">fancruft</a> is an issue that needs to addressed with a number of plot summaries, the summaries themselves are specifically allowed by any number of guidelines (I count <a href="#Series" title="Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28anime-_and_manga-related_articles%29">one</a>, <a href="#Plot" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject_Films/Style_guidelines">two</a>, <a href="#Plot_summaries" title="Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_%28writing_about_fiction%29">three</a>, and an overarching <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Content_disclaimer">fourth</a> off the top of my head).  Although there are discussions on how exactly these plots should be presented and whether twist endings should be given away (see <a href="" title="Wikipedia talk:Spoiler">Wikipedia talk:Spoiler</a> for the most prominent example), our concern is only with copyright infringement, not ensuring that a product sells well.  After all, you can buy guides for most games or novel adaptations for most movies immediately after they are released.  You can read reviews, read blogs, talk to friends, and do any number of things that could potentially decrease your enjoyment of something, but that is ultimately your prerogative.  Compiling <a href="" title="WP:V">verifiable information</a> on <a href="" title="WP:N">notable topics</a> is ours, and we do not practice <a href="" title="WP:CENSORED">self-censorship</a>.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Is_there_a_policy_on_obvious_errors_in_quotations.3F">Is there a policy on obvious errors in quotations?</span></h2>

<p>I have some experience with proofreading and copy editing, so I often find and fix typos or other minor errors in Wikipedia pages, simply to improve readability and accuracy.</p>
<p>Today I ran across an article which quotes an online source which itself contains an obvious typo:
<a href="" title="Palestinian_textbook_controversy">Palestinian_textbook_controversy</a> which some way down quotes an article as saying &#34;both ignore the other side&#39;s suffering and each counts only its <i>only</i> victims&#34; (emphasis mine). Clearly that was supposed to be &#34;own&#34;. But &#34;only&#34; is what the original source being quoted says (I checked the reference). Should I correct the typo or not?</p>
<p>As a possible compromise, some news media use square brackets for such repairs to the meaning of quotes, rendering &#34;both ignore the other side&#39;s suffering and each counts only its [own] victims&#34;</p>
<p>Assuming this sort of obvious change should be made, how far should it go? For example, I&#39;ve heard that Neil Armstrong maintains he said or at least intended to say &#34;That&#39;s one small step for <i>a</i> man&#34;, though the recording shows pretty certainly that he botched it and dropped the word &#34;a&#34;. I imagine that without the permanent recording device, we would long ago have forgotten his error, since it was obviously a slip of the tongue. Should history record such errors with ruthless accuracy, or express what the speaker <i>meant</i> to say? (EDIT: FWIW, the Neil Armstrong article uses the square brackets).</p>
<p>I did look for some kind of policy statement on this, but I haven&#39;t found one so far. Although, I confess I&#39;m not that familiar with Wikipedia yet, so I may not have looked in the right place. <a href="" title="User:Digitante">Digitante</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Digitante">talk</a>) 04:22, 11 January 2008 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>History always records what was said over what was intended, as this can on occasion lead to unforeseen and unintended consequences. However analysis of the sources may suggest the error and the implications this would result in. I believe in this circumstance, the correct solution is to add &#60;nowiki&#62;&#34;[sic]&#34;&#60;/nowiki&#62; after the apparent error, which highlights the odd use of a word, phrase or spelling. <a href="" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:LinaMishima">talk</a>) 04:29, 11 January 2008 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>To further clarify, <i>&#60;nowiki&#62;[word]&#60;/nowiki&#62;</i> is used when a word is implied or when paraphrasing the original, whilst <i>&#60;nowiki&#62;word [sic]&#60;/nowiki&#62;</i> is used for an apparent mis-use of a word, wrongful spelling, or other mistake, where &#39;sic&#39; is those three letters, rather than a correction. <a href="" title="User:LinaMishima">LinaMishima</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:LinaMishima">talk</a>) 04:47, 11 January 2008 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I wanted to bring to the community&#39;s attention the fact that as a part of a proposed decision (in voting stage) in a current ArbCom case <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Homeopathy/Proposed decision">Wikipedia:Requests for arbitration/Homeopathy/Proposed decision</a>, ArbCom is considering the creation of a new structure called the &#34;Sourcing Adjudication Board&#34;. The board will have broad authority in dealing with sourcing complaints on Wikipedia. Its mandate is described in the proposed decision as follows:
&#34;The Committee shall convene a Sourcing Adjudication Board, consisting of credentialed subject-matter experts insofar as is reasonable, which shall be tasked with examining complaints regarding the inappropriate use of sources on Wikipedia.  The Board shall issue findings, directly to the Committee, regarding all questions of source usage, including, but not limited to, the following:
</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ol>
<li>Whether an editor has engaged in misrepresentation of sources or their content.</li>
<li>Whether an editor has used unreliable or inappropriate sources.</li>
<li>Whether an editor has otherwise substantially violated any portion of the sourcing policies and guidelines.</li></ol></dd></dl>
<p>The Board&#39;s findings shall not be subject to appeal except to the Board itself.  The precise manner in which the Board will be selected and conduct its operations will be determined, with appropriate community participation, no later than one month after the closure of this case.&#34;
The current vote on this portion of the final decision is 6 for, 1 against and 1 abstention. <a href="" title="User:Nsk92">Nsk92</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Nsk92">talk</a>) 14:47, 21 May 2008 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The subject comes up a lot; see for instance <a href="" title="WT:UE">the Use English talk page</a>.  In order to get high-quality articles on topics related to China, we want as many people as possible who read both English and the relevant languages (such as Mandarin) to be finding the pages through a search.  If there&#39;s a certain Chinese character on the page, even if the typical English user doesn&#39;t see it because they don&#39;t have the font loaded up, that will generate hits on search engines that attract the attention we want.  As long as we have the search terms in place, there&#39;s strong support for limiting the non-Roman characters. - Dan <a href="" title="User:Dank55">Dank55</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dank55">send/receive</a>) 16:27, 23 September 2008 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Pictures of violence and gore are not subject to rules on profanity and generally not even offensiveness, but the question needs to be asked if the image is gratuitous. Is it there only to shock? Is it POV? Does it help understand the situation (without being POV), or is it only decoration? We have a lot of images in articles that are only marginally informative, but in this case, we need to be more selective, since such images are upsetting to a large group of people. -<a href="" title="User:Freekee">Freekee</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Freekee">talk</a>) 16:26, 15 February 2009 (UTC)

<p>I&#39;m just curious- say I was a really famous celebrity, but nobody knew my birth date for example.  Could I put it in, or would it be deleted, because there is no <i>proof</i> that I am said celebrity?

<li>Conflicts of interest are only a problem when they are abused. If I were a really famous celebrity, it would still be perfectly fine for me to revert vandalism on my entry—it would only be a problem if I started saying &#34;Nihiltres is the best person ever&#34; on the article. :) The &#34;no original research&#34; rule still applies, though, not because the identity of the celebrity is in question (they&#39;d just have to go through <a href="" title="Wikipedia:OTRS">OTRS</a>) but because the date is not verifiable. If I were a really famous celebrity and I identified to OTRS, I could say something like &#34;Nihiltres was born on April 1, 1969&#60;!--I&#39;ve had the Boards of Canada song &#34;1969&#34; from Geogaddi stuck in my head for a while--&#62;&#34; even though that&#39;s not true, and no one would be able to tell the difference.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Over_Use_of_Semi-Protection">Over Use of Semi-Protection</span></h2>

<p>I have recently noticed that wikipedia has become plagued by semi protection. It seems like a rare occurance now to be on an article page and not see the silver lock. This is of concern and directly against the philosophy of wikipedia. It seems to me that people are getting the idea that once a page is vadalised once it should be semi protected. In my opinion this should not be the case. For example one page I have found semi protected is the &#34;dog&#34; page. I doubt that this page is heavily vandalised (thinking from a vandals pov, doesn&#39;t seem very fun), futhermore there is nothing I can see on the discussion page about its protection. I feel we need to start actively fighting semi protection. Any thoughts? --<a href="" title="User:AresAndEnyo">AresAndEnyo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:AresAndEnyo">talk</a>) 15:03, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>What Wikipedia is actually is an encyclopedia created by everyone who has the whim to participate. This is what wikipedia has been about from the start. Someone searching through wikipedia as a user and finds a spelling mistake should be able to fix it without having to sign up for an account and waiting 4 days!! Your opinions are incorrect and you only want to push your elitism. I won&#39;t say your way is not better than the wikipedia way, but this is not your or any of our project&#39;s to mould. I think the only reason wikipedia has grown at all is the freedom to edit has allowed it to become dynamic and cutting edge. There are plenty of conservative encyclopedias out there with a dictionary definition of computers if people want. As for doing this only to &#34;established&#34; articles, it all becomes a matter of who draws the line.--<a href="" title="User:AresAndEnyo">AresAndEnyo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:AresAndEnyo">talk</a>) 17:31, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>That line is drawn only where vandalism is common. There&#39;s not a single page on my watchlist that is protected, and I seldom make edits to pages that are protected. People finding spelling mistakes and not being able to fix them, is not going to turn users away and reduce the quality. People leaving the project because they&#39;re spending all of their time fixing vandalism rather than writing articles is going to reduce the quality. New users will seldom make productive changes to established pages (heck, <i>I</i> seldom make such changes). I don&#39;t see a problem with making WP &#34;the encyclopedia that anyone can fill out a form and then edit.&#34;&#60;small&#62;&#60;span class=&#34;autosigned&#34;&#62;—Preceding <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="" title="User:Freekee">Freekee</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Freekee">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Freekee">contribs</a>) &#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;!-- Template:Unsigned --&#62; &#60;small&#62;00:53, 23 February 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I&#39;ve had several requests for semis declined because the level of vandalism wasn&#39;t enough or it had tapered off by the time the administrator looked at the request.  I&#39;ve also had some declined because the vandal(s) were blocked.  More than once I&#39;ve had to go back and say &#34;the vandalism is back&#34; and the article usually winds up with a few days&#39; or a week&#39;s semi-protection.  Indef. semi should only be used on persistent vandalism-magnets or magnets for sockpuppets of banned editors that have access to a wide variety of IP addresses.  In practice, this usually winds up being high-traffic, controversial articles.  The &#34;bar&#34; for BLP articles for semi should be somewhat lower than for other ariticles, but only if the vandalism is harmful to the subject of the article, not merely &#34;Elrod was here&#34;-type or page-blanking-type vandalism.

<dd>I think we have to take a pragmatic approach. Yes, we&#39;re the encyclopedia anyone can edit, but that doesn&#39;t mean anyone can change any part of it immediately in any way they like. One an article reaches a particular level of maturity, we can reasonably ask whether the costs of losing or inconveniencing IP editors by making them go through   would really exceed the costs of having to revert (or worse, failing to revert) regular IP vandalism/miguided attempts to improve. The vast majority of articles are doubtless not yet at that level (though I would still semi-protect BLPs as a matter of course), but many of the most read articles (so what <i>seems</i> like a majority) might well be. (Edit conflict: I don&#39;t really think flagged revisions are anything other than semi-protection - or some other level of protection - repackaged.)--<a href="" title="User:Kotniski">Kotniski</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kotniski">talk</a>) 16:02, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I agree with you saying that flagged revisions are just another semi-protection, thus the reason why I oppose them as well. However, I have to disagree with you on your first point. I think most people will agree with me that being an encyclopedia anyone can edit does directly imply that anyone can change any part of it immediately in any way that they see fit, which then implies that anyone can turn it back. What you are talking about is restraining the average helpful (occasionaly misguided) wikipedia user from editing pages. This is the big change and one that conflicts with policy. Protection should be used to protect pages from vandalism (that is users that continously try to destroy the page for their own ammusement) not protecting wikipedia from people trying to make wikipedia a better information source (even if you disagree from them). If we allow this increase in protection to continue (it may sound a bit dramatic) I believe we will start a slippery slope towards higher and higher level of protection. To the point when being able to edit a page will be source a painful application process that we will discourage new writers. As it is my feeling that wikipedia is composed at the moment of many decorated users who will probably loose interest in a few months, you can see how we will start to have an encyclopedia less and less people edit. This will lead to it being less and less relevant and thus less and less popular. --<a href="" title="User:AresAndEnyo">AresAndEnyo</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:AresAndEnyo">talk</a>) 17:43, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I can&#39;t see how going to an edit page an adding a template to suggest a change is easier for anyone than actually being able to edit the page directly, even if it requires a later person to approve it.

<dd>Those are good points, but I&#39;ve also known valuable editors leave or scale down their involvement in WP precisely <i>because</i> they see their good work being eroded over time with nothing to protect it. It wouldn&#39;t necessarily be a major offput to new editors to sometimes see a friendly message like <i>This article has been found to be of sufficiently high standard as to be protected from direct editing; it can nonetheless undoubtedly still be improved, and you are warmly encouraged to suggest edits (or request unprotection if necessary) by leaving a note on its talk page.</i> I think people who empathized with what the project fundamentally is (i.e. an encyclopedia, not an experiment in democracy/anarchy/...) would understand and accept.--<a href="" title="User:Kotniski">Kotniski</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kotniski">talk</a>) 18:13, 20 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>I, as an administrator, will honour any request to unprotect an article with indefinite (or <i>effectively</i> indefinite) semi-protection where I agree that the article may have a reasonable chance at staying largely vandalism-free. I think that this is in line with both our protection policy and the foundation principle that anyone should be able to edit. I do think that we could have a better system for protecting articles, and I think that a good candidate would be <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Flagged protection">flagged protection</a> as it was originally proposed. Unfortunately, those wishing a more restrictive system of flagged revisions opposed that proposal under the idea that it would replace Flagged Revisions. As an example, Sarcasticidealist&#39;s oppose was this: &#34;I could support this if it was intended to be in addition to the other implementation of flagged revisions. As I understand it, it&#39;s intended to supplant that, so I&#39;m opposed.&#34; I have not since seen an active proposal for the &#34;other implementation of flagged revisions&#34;, so I&#39;m understandably annoyed that politics has prevented us from making a useful and otherwise uncontroversial change. &#60;nowiki&#62;{&#60;/nowiki&#62;{<a href="" title="User:Nihiltres">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#233D7A;&#34;&#62;Nihiltres&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;nowiki&#62;|&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;span class=&#34;plainlinks&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Nihiltres">talk</a>&#60;nowiki&#62;|&#60;/nowiki&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=Nihiltres" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=Nihiltres">log</a>&#60;/span&#62;}&#60;nowiki&#62;}&#60;/nowiki&#62; 16:09, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>The proposal came up in the context of Jimbo&#39;s statement that he was going to ask the developers to turn on flagged revisions for BLPs.  Certainly, not all details of that were ironed out (and still aren&#39;t, which understandably annoys me).  Now, putting flagged revisions on BLPs isn&#39;t mutually exclusive with activating a new form of protection, like flagged protection, which is why I said that I could have supported flagged protection if it was in addition to turning on flagged revisions for all BLPs.  But the tone of discussion on flagged protection was very much &#34;Yes, this way we won&#39;t have all the downsides of other implementations of flagged revisions&#34;, so I opposed. <a href="" title="User:Sarcasticidealist">Sarcasticidealist</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Sarcasticidealist">talk</a>) 16:19, 20 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yes; last I heard Jimbo was attempting to formulate a proposal for FlaggedRevs which would be sufficiently effective and open to gain widespread community support. The difficulty of that task should not be understated. My point on the oppose is that the proposal shouldn&#39;t be opposed on the grounds of the opinions of others. Whereas the editors opposing widespread use of FlaggedRevs will oppose widespread use of FlaggedRevs regardless of whether flagged protection is implemented or not, opposing flagged protection on the basis of support for exclusive use of flagged protection seems counterproductive as anything but political jockeying. Is that a fair statement? &#60;nowiki&#62;{&#60;/nowiki&#62;{<a href="" title="User:Nihiltres">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#233D7A;&#34;&#62;Nihiltres&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;nowiki&#62;|&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;span class=&#34;plainlinks&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Nihiltres">talk</a>&#60;nowiki&#62;|&#60;/nowiki&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=Nihiltres" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=Nihiltres">log</a>&#60;/span&#62;}&#60;nowiki&#62;}&#60;/nowiki&#62; 08:15, 21 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I can&#39;t say I was fully satisfied with the initial version of flagged protection, but I agree opposing a moderate move because it is not strong enough when the stronger one clearly has no sufficient support is counterproductive and can only led to status quo. I have proposed a <a href="#Proposed_changes" title="Wikipedia_talk:Flagged_protection">new version</a> that I think addresses most concerns (creation of a reviewer group, autoconfirmed users are autoreviewed, but this can be disabled on a per-article basis).  I have put together this and two other proposals at <a href="" title="User:Cenarium/Proposal">User:Cenarium/Proposal</a> that I think would help the BLP and unfocused vandalism issues that cannot be handled by protection. <a href="" title="User:Cenarium">Cenarium</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Cenarium">talk</a>) 16:45, 22 February 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The fewer pages that are protected the better. It would seem obvious that flagged revisions, which I vehemently oppose, would replace semi-protection, not be added to semi-protection. The cd versions of Wikipedia are in effect the flagged revision. When I started using Wikipedia, de rigueur was to look at the revision history and look for what seemed to be a stable edit and read that one. I never cared what the current version said, because I did not even look at it other than to see how it differed. The reason I strongly oppose flagged revisions is that &#34;anyone can edit&#34; and I <i>really</i> do not want to have to wait for someone to &#34;approve&#34; a good edit, no matter who makes it. Also you get into this ridiculous hierarchy of who approves the edits, who approves the people who approve the edits, who approves them, and so on ad finitum. I think the best approach is to watch changes, all of them, and flag them as good/bad/indifferent, and if they are bad, fix them quickly, and never get upset about having odd information in any article for a few seconds. The only time I would semi-protect an article would be if no one can keep up with the corrections. <a href="" title="User:Apteva">Apteva</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Apteva">talk</a>) 16:51, 24 February 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Just to clarify, in case it&#39;s not already clear: flagged protection explicitly says that flagged revisions should only be used in a flagged-revisions-visible-by-default configuration on pages that would otherwise be semi-protected (or full-protected). In that case, it is an improvement for the principle of open editing you describe, in that pages which originally could only be edited by autoconfirmed users (or admins) would then be editable by all users with simply a system of checks for new users (or non-admin users) before the edits went &#34;live&#34;. I &#34;vehemently oppose&#34; FlaggedRevs for a system that would effectively protect most articles, and yet it is my opinion that flagged protection is a good system. I might as well also point out that the &#34;hierarchy&#34; you describe is actually relatively simple: reviewers (who can approve edits) would (presumably) be flagged by administrators, who are flagged through <a href="" title="WP:RFA">a community process</a>. Any hierarchy is relatively short, and the reviewer group would be only one extra rung on the ladder. Make sure you understand what you say you &#34;vehemently oppose&#34;. :)</dd>
<dd>What you might be more interested in is the &#34;patrolled revisions&#34; proposal Cenarium makes on the same page, which proposes to use FlaggedRevs without any effect except marking revisions as acceptably clean, which would introduce a more tangible system for the procedure that you describe. I don&#39;t think this system is exclusive of the flagged protection system, since the flagged-revision-by-default option can be enabled on individual pages, and it would ultimately help reduce the number of pages which are semi-protected by making vandalism easier to manage. &#60;nowiki&#62;{&#60;/nowiki&#62;{<a href="" title="User:Nihiltres">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#233D7A;&#34;&#62;Nihiltres&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;nowiki&#62;|&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;span class=&#34;plainlinks&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Nihiltres">talk</a>&#60;nowiki&#62;|&#60;/nowiki&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=Nihiltres" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=Nihiltres">log</a>&#60;/span&#62;}&#60;nowiki&#62;}&#60;/nowiki&#62; 18:26, 24 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

Note that a developer has opposed giving reviewer rights to any autoconfirmed user and it would go against the will of the foundation to make editing easier.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Propaganda_Articles">Propaganda Articles</span></h2>

<p>Firstly: I think i put this in the right place.</p>
<p>For a few months ago, i edited the St. Gilgen International School article. It sounded like an advertisment for the school and i changed it to a normal, fair article. Once again, when i looked at it today, somebody had been in and covered up the parts that i had written that sounded bad, like that there was no gyms at the school. The style of writing made me think that someone from the school had gone in and edited it, so that students who read it got a good impression. </p>
<p>Also, thougher things, like information added in places were it shouldnt be. This was also there last time before i removed it. Im starting to think that people are using wikipedia to give people postive impressions. Another example is that of the Naples article. After reading the book Gommora, i looked at the wikipedia article. The only mention of crime in the city with the worlds highest murder rate was 5 short lines.</p>

<p>I and apparently several other users have been having disagreements with <a href="" title="User:Rotational">User:Rotational</a> (see <a href="" title="User talk:Rotational">User talk:Rotational</a>) over the appropriate level of headings used in articles. As can been seen from Rotational&#39;s talk page, this issue has been going on for a while. I got involved with article  , where from my reading of <a href="" title="WP:LAYOUT">WP:LAYOUT</a>, this should use &#60;nowiki&#62; == xx == &#60;/nowiki&#62; (level 2), while Rotational uses &#60;nowiki&#62; ==== xx ==== &#60;/nowiki&#62; (level 4). This makes the articles in question (not just Barnard 68, also <a href="" title="NGC 2818">NGC 2818</a>, among others) look different from other articles on Wikipedia. I would appreciate comments from the community on this issue. <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/76.66.193.90">76.66.193.90</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:76.66.193.90">talk</a>) 06:46, 27 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Yes, this has been going on for quite a long time. I still haven&#39;t ever received an explanation of why he prefers the articles that way except for personal aesthetic preference. The obvious solution to the problem is to have Rotational alter his <a href="" title="Help:User style">user style sheet</a> so that he will see level-4 headings when everyone else sees level-2. This has been suggested in the past and more recently, but the user persists and doesn&#39;t want to change his style sheets. I can&#39;t begin to guess why (other than because I suggested it). When this topic has come up before on AN/I (twice), many editors agreed that <a href="" title="MOS:HEAD">MOS:HEAD</a> exists for a reason and Rotational should follow it. Some saw it as no big deal, but nothing had really been done about it. Perhaps a different, stronger voice than my own might be able to convince Rotational to make use of the user style sheet. --<a href="" title="User:Rkitko">Rkitko</a> &#60;sup&#62;&#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:Rkitko">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62;&#60;/sup&#62; 13:15, 27 February 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<li>Is the nudity necessary to illustrate the subject?  Is there an alternative illustration that has equal value but lacks nudity?</li>
<li>Would the nudity be (editorially) appropriate in a similar print or online context &#38;mdash; newsmagazine (<i>Time</i>) or newspaper (<i>New York Times</i>) cover, or front page of the CNN or BBC websites?</li></ol></dd>

<p>Adding the template   to a page adds <a href="" title="noindex">noindex</a> to the html, causing Google and other search engines to exclude the page from their indexes. Currently, it has no effect in mainspace (articles). It is usually added to administrator noticeboards, userpages of banned users, sensitive AfD discussions and other project pages to keep sensitive information out of Google. <a href="" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">User:Cool Hand Luke</a> has been adding the NOINDEX tag to subcategories of <a href="" title="Category:Criminals">Category:Criminals</a>, which are part of the encyclopedia content. We should have a policy or guideline on when and where is can or should be used. </p>

I see you are adding the   template to many mainspace categories. This seems like a bad idea.

<dd>If it is a BLP violation, then the article or category should be deleted, or the the article removed from the category. </dd>
<dd>There is no technical separation between types of categories (yet), but I would say that categories (and templates) are either part of the encyclopedia or project/maintenance.

<dd>Categories cannot be watched or confirmed like articles. With an article, one can check the sources are remove BLP violations fairly straightforwardly.

Frankly, I think low-profile BLPs should be excluded from indexing themselves, but the software does not permit it.</dd>
<dd>I weight the potential for harming a living person versus the slight ease of users finding a category like &#34;Latvian rapists.&#34; In my estimation, this balance leans strongly in favor of keeping them off of google.

<p>The community needs to come to some consensus on this.  There is a good proposal somewhere to NOINDEX some non-content spaces, but this is an important decision for all of us to make.  We shouldn&#39;t be NOINDEXING article categories (I&#39;m fine w/ noindexing &#34;wikipedia&#34;, &#34;maintenance&#34; or &#34;hidden&#34; cats) piecemeal.  Every google hit is a potential editor willing to help us out.  If we come to a decision that protecting individuals demands we noindex some non-article content, good, but we should only do so after weighing the benefits against the cost. <a href="" title="User:Protonk">Protonk</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Protonk">talk</a>) 20:34, 27 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I don&#39;t think you&#39;ll find a fight from reasonable editors in saying that user related pages (the User:/User talk: namespace, SPI, CSN, etc.) don&#39;t need to be indexed.  But most other stuff is just as much our products as the encyclopedia are.  We are engaged in two major experiments here, the production of an online encyclopedia without paid editors and the management of an online community without hierarchy.  Both are novel and interesting.

<dd>No, that&#39;s absurd. We have taboos against editing other people&#39;s comments, so at the very least it&#39;s obvious that BLP talk pages shouldn&#39;t be indexed. Once again, if folks want to take a factory tour, they can use the box at left, but we should not widely publicize information that we don&#39;t even maintain or watch (such as talk archives). <a href="" title="User:Cool Hand Luke">Cool Hand</a> <i><a href="" title="User talk:Cool Hand Luke">Luke</a></i> 21:12, 2 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<ul>
<li>Agreed a consensus it needed.  We need to distinguish between &#34;internal&#34; searches (executed by editors from within the wikipedia space) and external searches via www.google.com etc.  IMO material in user sandboxes should be hidden from external searches because of the risk it may contain inaccurate BLP material that is not supervised by the usual WP processes.  In particular, &#60;nowiki&#62; &#60;/nowiki&#62; should be added by default whenever a disputed article is &#34;user-fied&#34; so that it can be improved.  If a side-effect is that all pages in User: space are hidden from external searches, I don&#39;t see a great problem with that, though internal search features might need to be improved a bit. - <a href="" title="User:Pointillist">Pointillist</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Pointillist">talk</a>) 07:19, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I would agree that only article space and File (formerly image) space and the part of  WP space giving ing our policy should be indexed by Google.

We remain public--anyone who wants to search anything not actually deleted can do so internally, and it works very well.

The RFC is closely divided, with many people citing Wikipedia’s policy against censorship.  If the image is ultimately not included, will we need consensus to insert a tag (e.g. NPOV Dispute tag), so that readers will at least be on their guard about conformity with Wikipedia policies, such as <a href="" title="WP:CENSOR">the policy against censorship</a>?  It seems like there would be the same close division regarding insertion of the tag as there is regarding the underlying issue.</p>
<p>This kind of situation must occur a lot, where there&#39;s some kind of dispute, and there&#39;s the same division about tagging the article as there was about the underlying dispute.

<p>A while ago I noticed that the above extremely high-use template, which invokes language from <a href="#Burden_of_evidence" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a> (WP:BURDEN), reverses the policy by placing the burden on the person who challenges the material to show it is unverif<i>iable</i> before removal (rather than unverif<i>ied</i>). Prior versions of this template simply referred to <i>unsourced</i> material, which to my mind is equivalent in usage to <i>unverified</i>, and is the current language used in the related template,  . I first suggested simply changing unverifiable to unverified. One user strenuously objected, and another does not like the use of either unverified or unverifiable. The same user suggested we incorporate the suggestion of using inline citations for sourcing into the template, which I think is a good idea. You can read all the gruesome details at <a href="#Template_incorrectly_refers_to_unverifiable_material" title="Template talk:Unreferenced">the template&#39;s talk page</a>.

<p>(Separating this out from the discussion about guidelines which is really what I wanted to raise - see below.)
&#60;small&#62;(Just some background for those fortunate enough not to have become involved: there were formerly three guidelines: Manual of Style (linking), Only make links that are relevant to the context, and Build the web. The first two were quite extensive, BTW quite brief; the latter two were perceived as &#34;cancelling each other out&#34; as to the issues of overlinking/underlinking. To avoid this misleading division of information, the three pages were merged with uanimous agreement in early January to form one comprehensive guideline on the subject, recently renamed <a href="" title="WP:Linking">WP:Linking</a>. The former pages were redirected to the new one; but recently (as an overspill from the date linking war at ArbCom) a few people tried to reinstate the old wording of BTW as a separate guideline. Majority opinion was that it should be reinstated but marked as historical or an essay; however some still refused to accept that and the page was protected following edit warring as to its status. It happened to be protected in a state where it was marked as a disputed guideline. The text is essentially the same as it was before. WP:Linking incorporates the substance of BTW as well as other aspects of internal and external linking - naturally it is also the subject of a certain amount of date-linking-related edit warring, but has been fairly stable since the merge.)--<a href="" title="User:Kotniski">Kotniski</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kotniski">talk</a>) 11:06, 6 March 2009 (UTC) &#60;/small&#62;

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="New_level_of_geographical_notability.3F">New level of geographical notability?</span></h2>

<p>I decided to use the &#34;random article&#34; link, and not only were four out of the five articles I went to geographical in origin, all but one were stubs.  One was one line pretty much indicating that the place exists.  It leads me to believe that we have far too many geographical location stubs for which there is no easily accessible encyclopedic information.  I think there is an important distinction between jumbles of information and a useful article.  For geography, we clearly have more of the former than the latter.  As an example, I got 6630 Google hits for <a href="" title="Tafire">Tafire</a>.  Number four was an EBay listing for stamps, and five was &#34;free internet dating.&#34;  Other than that, it&#39;s all just maps.  </p>
<p>So, I think we need to reconsider what makes a place notable, because I am sure this is by no means the only example of this situation on WP.  We need to consider what is <i>encyclopedic</i> vs. what merely <i>is</i>. <a href="" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:MSJapan">talk</a>) 00:57, 27 February 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Reconsideration has been grinding on for a long time. I&#39;m not sure where they&#39;ve got to.

<p>Where did the idea of inherent notability of populated places come from? I see many people simply stating this as fact on AfDs but I also see a number of people who disagree with this concept. I can&#39;t find any discussion that led to consensus. There is an <a href="" title="WP:Notability (geography)">essay</a> with only one contributor and no discussion, a <a href="" title="WP:Notability (Geographic locations)">proposal</a> that never reached consensus (including a majority against <a href="#Using_an_Atlas_as_a_source_for_notability" title="Wikipedia talk:Notability (Geographic locations)">here</a>).<a href="" title="User:OrangeDog">OrangeDog</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:OrangeDog">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/OrangeDog">edits</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 14:52, 28 February 2009 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>It came from many AFD discussions over many years.  It&#39;s not quite true.  See <a href="#Notability_is_not_a_blanket" title="User:Uncle G/On notability">User:Uncle G/On notability</a>.  What it is is a <i>proxy</i>, for the <i>real</i> argument that such places, <i>by their very natures</i>, will be covered in depth in multiple independent published works by identifiable people with good reputations for fact checking and accuracy: censuses, geological and meteorological studies, history books, political and social studies, newspaper articles, and so forth.&#60;p&#62;As for the fact that we have lots of very short stubs, part of the problem is that, ironically, we tend to <i>reject</i> proposals from people who want to add <i>substantial</i> stubs en masse.  The end result is that, as you have seen, we get a lesser amount of handwritten, <i>shorter</i>, and often <i>poorly written</i>, stubs instead.  It&#39;s worthwhile to remember that <a href="" title="User:Rambot">Rambot</a> cited sources.&#60;p&#62;However, the fact that a geographical place <i>currently</i> is a very short stub does not necessarily mean that it has no potential to be otherwise.  The <i>only</i> thing that the state of the article says anything about is Wikipedia editors, not the subjects.  <a href="" title="North Asia">North Asia</a> was a two-sentence stub for <i>almost five years</i> before it was expanded.  And that&#39;s a <i>major region of the planet</i>.&#60;p&#62;<a href="" title="User:MSJapan">MSJapan</a>, you&#39;re forgetting the Wikipedia maxim that we&#39;re here to &#34;make the Internet not suck&#34;.  Part of the thinking underlying that maxim is that <i>it currently does</i>.  Towns in non-Anglophone African countries aren&#39;t exactly well-documented on the World Wide Web.  Google Web is not the sole way to find sources.  Our remit to make the World Wide Web &#34;not suck&#34; lies in the creation of an encyclopaedia article that provides the information that <i>isn&#39;t</i> on the World Wide Web.

<dd>I agree they will be <i>by their nature</i> covered by censuses, geological and meteorological studies, clearly establishing their <b>existence</b>. However, it does not follow that they will necessarily be covered by history books, political and social studies, newspaper articles, and so forth, which would establish <b>notability</b>. Without the existence of these sources then the article can never be more than a directory entry.<a href="" title="User:OrangeDog">OrangeDog</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:OrangeDog">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/OrangeDog">edits</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 00:48, 2 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The question is, what is notability?  As we normally interpret the concept, it means <i>enough people have made enough (reliable) observations about this topic for us to make an article that is balanced and goes into more depth than a simple definition of its subject</i>.  Essentially, we defer the judgement to other people; if other people have decided a topic is worth researching and publishing (via a formal publishing process with a reputation for accuracy, as required by <a href="" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>), then we take that as evidence that it is suitable for us to include it.  In this case, enough separate people have decided that geographical locations are worth researching and publishing information about that we can assume &#34;notability&#34; (which means something different here to the natural English meaning of the word) is met for all but the most obscure.</dd>
<dd>Another question to ask is, &#34;is this article about a kind of thing I&#39;d expect to find in an encyclopedia?&#34;.  Encyclopediae clearly <i>do</i> contain articles about places, and tend to include an ever-expanding number of such articles as the size of the encyclopedia increases, so because <a href="" title="WP:NOTPAPER">wikipedia is not paper</a> this suggests that there is no reason an extremely large encyclopedia (which is what wikipedia is) shouldn&#39;t cover some quite small and obscure places.</dd>
<dd>So the question becomes, why not cover these places? <a href="" title="User:JulesH">JulesH</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:JulesH">talk</a>) 15:53, 5 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I look at the reason a little differently, but compatibly with what Jules and UncleG said above. For smaller places, there would be great difficulty in deciding with available resources whether or not each individual place is notable,and almost all of them actually would be if investigated completely enough. Therefore it is convenient to consider them all notable. Perhaps 20% might not be--but having these in wp is more than balanced by not having several hundred additional afd discussions a day, especially considered that the error rate in such afds is likely to be considerably higher than 20%. In the case of many other topics, we do not do this, because most of the resulting articles below the level of notability would be necessarily promotional. But that&#39;s not the case here, where the basic facts can be described. All encyclopedias traditionally include an atlas ad a gazeteer, and this is part of the intended content. <b><a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> (<a href="" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a>) 16:13, 5 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>Short stubs can be useful, if sources are cited and the location of the place is clear enough, and a place that is officially recognised (e.g. if it appears both in censuses and on maps) is likely to have enough coverage for more than a stub.  Geographical articles are less likely to have problems than articles about companies and living people.  Also the results from <a href="" title="Special:Random">Special:Random</a> could be a coincidence, only two of the ten articles it took me to<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Snigbrook/Sandbox&#38;oldid=275206309" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Snigbrook/Sandbox&#38;oldid=275206309"><a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Snigbrook/Sandbox&#38;oldid=275206309" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Snigbrook/Sandbox&#38;oldid=275206309">http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=User:Snigbrook/Sandbox&#38;oldid=275206309</a></a> were geographical. —<a href="" title="User talk:Snigbrook">&#60;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400; color:blue&#34;&#62;Snigbrook&#60;/span&#62;</a> 17:42, 5 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Again, I agree entirely with JulesH&#39;s definition of notability, but question why notability can be assumed for <b>all</b> places when only <b>some</b> have been researched and published in reliable sources. As for why not to include places that do not meet this definition, <a href="" title="WP:DIRECTORY">WP:DIRECTORY</a> springs immediately to mind.</dd>
<dd>I&#39;m sure no-one would dispute that lots of separate people have decided that numbers are worth researching and publishing via a <a href="" title="WP:V">WP:V</a>-compatible formal process. It is also easily verifiable that <a href="" title="524288">524288</a> is a number. However, there is no article for that number because there are no sources that can provide any information on this number other than it&#39;s names, location with respect to other numbers, etc. It is however notable in a narrow field, sufficient to feature in other articles (<a href="" title="Pythagorean comma">Pythagorean comma</a>, <a href="" title="Enharmonic scale">Enharmonic scale</a>), but <i>not to have its own article</i>.</dd>
<dd>It seems this would be a more sensible way to judge articles on places, and more in line with current Wikipedia practices.</dd>
<dd>And yes, encyclopaediae contain an increasing number of <b>notable</b> places as they expand.</dd>
<dd>For the stub issue, it&#39;s not a question of the current content of an article, but of whether the subject of the article merits the article&#39;s existence at all. I also draw attention to the following from <a href="" title="WP:N">WP:N</a>: <i>However, articles should not be written based on speculation that the topic may receive additional coverage in the future.</i></dd>
<dd>Finally, 2 out of 10 Random articles is a rather significant proportion. This would imply over 270,000 similar articles on English Wikipedia. Adding the previous 4/5 gives 6 in 15, making 40% of the 2.77 million articles like this.</dd>

<dl>
<dd>Nobody&#39;s speculating that these will be covered in the future. The speculation is that someone will get around to assembling the already-extant coverage into a future Wikipedia article, and this speculation is not only allowed but encouraged. In the exceedingly rare case that a location hasn&#39;t seen any coverage, it can always be upmerged to a larger geographical subdivision. - <a href="" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In &#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<b>Bl♟ck</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:A_Man_In_Black">conspire</a> - <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 23:18, 5 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I would like to see some evidence that it is legitimate to assume, without any evidence, that this coverage exists for <i>every settlement in the world</i>.

<dl>
<dd>I can&#39;t prove that every single settlement is notable. I can, however, point out that the vast majority are, and that the ones that aren&#39;t can easily be merged. I wouldn&#39;t object even to aggressive merging of minor hamlets and such. - <a href="" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In &#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<b>Bl♟ck</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:A_Man_In_Black">conspire</a> - <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 06:48, 6 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>I believe strongly in the inherent notability of towns, because to me notability is not just about being the subject of reliable sources; it&#39;s about having a substantial <i>influence</i> on the world and having that influence be <i>long-lasting</i>. A website can evaporate overnight, a TV episode or performer plays only a small part in the lives of the people who watch it. A town is by definition a place where many people spend large portions of their lives, and consequently has enormous complexity and interest whether or not anyone has documented it yet. I&#39;m also concerned that the surveys here are (much) too small to provide any kind of accurate estimate about how many geographic stubs are extant. <a href="" title="User:Dcoetzee">Dcoetzee</a> 23:32, 5 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>While this may be true for towns, it does not follow for <b>every</b> settlement, thus highlighting a potential need for new levels of notability. Also, while it would be lovely if Wikipedia contained the truth, I&#39;m afraid the best that can be done is the <a href="" title="WP:V">verifiable</a> truth. (I was not seriously suggesting we do a survey of stubs, just pointing out the statistics to Snigbrook). <a href="" title="User:OrangeDog">OrangeDog</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:OrangeDog">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/OrangeDog">edits</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 23:47, 5 March 2009 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>&#34;Well, <i>I</i> think it&#39;s important&#34; is a really crappy argument for notability. - <a href="" title="User:A Man In Black">A Man In &#60;font color=&#34;black&#34;&#62;<b>Bl♟ck</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:A_Man_In_Black">conspire</a> - <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/A Man In Black">past ops</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 06:48, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;m not arguing for notability. I&#39;m arguing for <i>inclusion</i>; I think most geographic locations should be included whether or not they&#39;re notable. <a href="" title="User:Dcoetzee">Dcoetzee</a> 20:15, 6 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Even if we accept the argument that all human settlements are inherently notable (something I very much disagree with) that does not mean it <i>must</i> have an article <i>right now!!!!!!</i> If all you can find out about a place is that it exists and where it is then perhaps it&#39;s not all that notable after all, any more than knowing my name and address makes me notable. It also means that you can&#39;t write an article on it. The best you can do is fashion an empty placeholder where a genuine article will presumably be written later on. Sham articles like this actually harm Wikipedia because they make it harder to maintain, dilute its quality and information, and make the random article feature a farce that damages Wikipedia&#39;s credibility. The moral of the story: don&#39;t write an article until you <i>can</i> write an article. <a href="" title="User:Reyk">&#60;font color=&#34;Maroon&#34;&#62;<b>Reyk</b>&#60;/font&#62;</a> &#60;sub&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Reyk"><b>&#60;font color=&#34;Blue&#34;&#62;YO!&#60;/font&#62;</b></a>&#60;/sub&#62; 05:54, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

<p>I have started work on <a href="" title="List of townships in North Dakota">townships in North Dakota</a>, the majority of which are stubs simply because I do not have the time to create a fully fleshed out article on day one, so I create a reasonable stub with the intent of expanding the article as time permits. I have several independent sources, for example, of townships in <a href="" title="Adams County, North Dakota">Adams County, North Dakota</a> and <a href="" title="Barnes County, North Dakota">Barnes County, North Dakota</a>, including detailed histories and information about their significance to the county, state, including famous people born/lived there. Real life has stalled my efforts, and I&#39;m limited to how long my state library will let me check out the books. Books, and not the Internet, are going to be the key sources for a lot of these articles. Even townships or places have 1, 2, or no residents today often had hundreds if now thousands of residents at the turn of the 20th Century. They were notable at one time, and since notablilty is not fleeting (once notable, always notable), they should be included in WP.

<ol>
<li>(<b>assumption</b>) There is a negative correlation between the size of a population centre and the number of centres of that size (i.e. there are far more extant hamlets than villages and villages than towns). Phrases like &#34;vast majority&#34;, employed without stating the scale, should be avoided . At the smallest scale there are over <a href="" title="World population">6.7 billion</a> population centres.</li>
<li>Wikipedia is (and should be) neither a <a href="" title="WP:DIRECTORY">directory</a> of places nor of business/schools/&#38;c. within a place.</li>
<li>Places should not have their own article if their <b>existence</b> cannot be <a href="" title="WP:V">verified</a>.</li>
<li>Above a certain size, all population centres meet <a href="" title="WP:N">WP:N</a> and should have their own article.</li>
<li>Existence of stubs articles about <b><a href="" title="WP:N">notable</a></b> subjects is not a problem, rather it is usually beneficial.</li></ol>

<p>Conjecture: Places below the aforementioned size may not be notable enough to merit <b>their own article</b>, but should probably be mentioned somewhere. A guideline is required to help distinguish between creating an article, or just a mention in the parent parish/town/ward or equivalent article.</p>
<p>Further: Could this guideline be modelled on <a href="" title="WP:ORG">WP:ORG</a> or <a href="" title="WP:NUMBER">WP:NUMBER</a>? Should redirects be created to every one of these inclusions? Should current places that would fail this guideline be merged into the parent article (by definition there would be near-no content to merge). Could bot assistance be employed in some way?</p>

<dl>
<dd>Obviously I agree with the conjecture and think the limit should be somewhere near the 1000 people level. However, this this is only based on experience of English hamlets and villages. I support the redirect/merge approach rather than omission/deletion both on principle and pragmatic reasons. A draft guideline is forming in my head with a similar form to <i>Notability of specific numbers</i>, but ideas from elsewhere are probably applicable. <a href="" title="User:OrangeDog">OrangeDog</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:OrangeDog">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/OrangeDog">edits</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 10:19, 6 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>The essential point of dispute here is where to draw the line for size. An unincorporated region with a population of 3 may indeed be not notable enough for its own article; but what about a town of 100? Or a town of 50? 20?

AD in particular has an unmistakable theological context that can considered insulting by non-Christians, though people from a Christian background usually do not have the actual meaning of the term in mind. A Jewish book written by Jews on a Jewish subject will normally avoid it. In the particular sensitive subject of early Christianity  where the BC/BCE vs. AD/CE distinction must be frequently made, most academic work now uses the BCE/CE terminology. In this use particularly I consider it a signal of awareness of cultural sensitivity, and to some extent I do also in dealing with any Jewish subject. Orthodox Jews will generally avoid AD in all contexts, but most do not regard it as insensitive if others use it in secular or Christian contexts.  None the less, I do not change the form in established articles, and agree completely with PMAnderson that doing so will quite properly be considered disruptive.  <b><a href="" title="User:DGG">DGG</a></b> (<a href="" title="User talk:DGG">talk</a>) 16:51, 5 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>color and colour reflect a spelling difference between two similar cultures.

No seriously, is it? If there&#39;s disagreement as to where consensus lies, then just let everyone use up their 3 reverts a day and see where it stops? Or if it doesn&#39;t stop, let an admin protect a random version, thus statistically giving preference to the most numerous and ardent edit-warriors? I only ask because no admin ever seems willing (except at AfD and the like) to determine or ask for evidence about what the consensus is; only to stick their protection oar in at random and tell people to keep talking.

<dd>(ec) No, it [edit-warring] isn&#39;t. Edit-warring is obviously discouraged: editors who engage in such lose reputation, might be blocked, and the page will get protected randomly anyway. What might not be up to snuff is the resolution of the underlying dispute, which is always the main problem—we need to address the illness (the dispute) rather than the symptoms (the edit war). This is what we want to do, and it&#39;s something that I&#39;m sure is probably implied somewhere in some vague guideline or policy. I&#39;ve historically avoided disputes: I naturally find them unpleasant. This may be a failing on my part: we need to work hard to resolve disputes quickly and fairly. I&#39;m slowly starting to try a little dispute resolution: I have some ideas about how to resolve disputes that I may eventually write up into a proposal once I understand the underlying concepts well enough. &#60;nowiki&#62;{&#60;/nowiki&#62;{<a href="" title="User:Nihiltres">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#233D7A;&#34;&#62;Nihiltres&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;nowiki&#62;|&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;span class=&#34;plainlinks&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Nihiltres">talk</a>&#60;nowiki&#62;|&#60;/nowiki&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=Nihiltres" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=Nihiltres">log</a>&#60;/span&#62;}&#60;nowiki&#62;}&#60;/nowiki&#62; 18:34, 1 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>In general I see some of the problem. In an edit war if two editors gang up on another; they can easily get the lone editor to violate 3RR and get this editor blocked, then claiming a new consensus while the other editor is blocked. I have seen editors trying this tactic; although to their credit, most admins don&#39;t fall for this scheme. <a href="" title="User:Arnoutf">Arnoutf</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Arnoutf">talk</a>) 22:00, 1 March 2009 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>allow me to interject my own special brand of cynicism.    while I think that most articles on wikipedia do quite well in terms of graceful discussion, when it comes to articles where there is any kind of invested ideology - no.  edit wars rule there, and the victors are the people who are sneakiest about edit warring.  generally speaking, what will happen is that one (or sometimes all) side(s) start(s) creating a general ruckus on the article (massive reverts by different editors, vitriolic edit summaries and talk page comments, the sudden appearance of editors who&#39;ve never edited the article before), and then will try to call in an admin at the height of it all, on the well-founded assumption that the admin will feel the need to act quickly, and thus will act without due consideration.  This gets the page locked down into a favorable form, maybe gets an opponent blocked, keeps it locked (because admins won&#39;t get involved in wheel-wars).  and if you need evidence that this is true, notice that the moment the page gets locked the ruckus disappears (not dies down, mind you - it goes poof). no one bothers to say anything on the talk page <i>at all</i> at that point because they know they don&#39;t have to.  there&#39;s no element of meaningful discussion on those pages; it&#39;s all just noise intended to clog the system.</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>this is a weakness in the wikipedia structure, if you ask me.  the &#39;independent admin&#39; thing breeds a kind of &#39;old west&#39; mentality. usually it works well: the Marshal (admin) rides into town (an article) and settles whatever disputes are there with good ol&#39; white hat efficiency.  but cagey black hats can pretty much bushwhack anyone they want with impunity if they throw enough dust in the air.  that won&#39;t fool a careful, experienced admin, of course, but there&#39;s a whole lot of admins out there.  </dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Part of what you&#39;re observing is that, although <a href="" title="WP:CONSENSUS">WP:CONSENSUS</a> is one of the major rules, no one has any special authority to determine or articulate consensus.  Including admins as Skomorokh points out, who at most ought to <i>enforce</i> consensus in the (fairly rare) situation where the consensus is genuinely evident.  So the only really successful outcome of consensus being manifested in a talk page is that someone <a href="" title="WP:BOLD">WP:BOLD</a>-ly takes an action that enacts or enacts an approximation of the consensus and that action doesn&#39;t get challenged or reverted.  For the most part it&#39;s <i>not</i> that an admin or anyone else comes in, reads up on the consensus, and makes everyone follow that gestalt opinion.</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>I really think that the way it works is the best way it could work.  It means that articles on divisive or controversial topics must always be read with a critical eye - but really that&#39;s true for material on that sort of topic from <i>any</i> source, you should never just accept what one source says about something controversial (or what one source says on <i>any</i> topic IMO.)

<dd>How do you reach that conclusion? The answer to my original question seems to be yes, consensus does mean nothing if there are people around who are not willing to accept it. How does our tolerating (or not) of this situation have any effect on the quality of articles on the less controversial topics? And why do you conclude that this is the best way it could work?

<p>What the past few months have taught me is that there are editors who are like Hamas or Hezbollah. No matter how badly your side got trounced, no matter how lopsided the margin of your defeat, always – always – claim victory, or at least do not admit defeat.

P.S. <a href="" title="WP:EDITWAR">WP:EDITWAR</a> is probably the most broken policy on WP, for a good analysis see <a href="#Why_edit_warriors_can_win." title="User:Piotrus/Morsels_of_wikiwisdom">User:Piotrus/Morsels_of_wikiwisdom</a>--<a href="" title="User:Goodmorningworld">Goodmorningworld</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Goodmorningworld">talk</a>) 14:34, 2 March 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>What happened here is that 
</p>
<ul>
<li>a couple of editors decided to be bold, on some semi-abandoned talk page, about merging in a different guideline. </li>
<li>They were reverted</li>
<li>A <a href="#Resurrect_this_guideline.3F" title="Wikipedia_talk:MOSLINK">Wikipedia_talk:MOSLINK</a> discussion ensued, which showed that there was considerable, although not majority, sentiment for the merged guideline being restored, which it was.  </li></ul>

<p>So far so good. But what is happening now is that a few editors are citing their  side of the merge discussion as consensus; they could be working towards consensus by making different proposals, or they could be persuading opponents individually. But they are not; they are forum-shopping by coming here. <a href="" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a>&#60;/small&#62; 16:27, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Well, your &#34;decided to be bold&#34; is the most ridiculous bit; but let&#39;s not discuss that incident here. Of course editwarring is a symptom of disagreement, but disagreement is supposedly resolved through consensus. That doesn&#39;t require unanimity (obviously), and there will always be issues that engnder strong disagreement. So if two parties dispute whether there is consensus to do this or that, or (in the absence of consensus) what to do in the interim, how is that dispute resolved? By yet another discussion to reach consensus? That would spiral on for ever. So - in the rare extreme cases where no-one backs down - it needs to be resolved. Either by someone adjudicating, or by fighting it out. At the moment the approved procedure seems to be &#34;fight it out&#34;, so that should be documented in our policy.--<a href="" title="User:Kotniski">Kotniski</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kotniski">talk</a>) 17:03, 2 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Nothing wrong with being bold, as long as you discuss the issue  <i>when somebody disagrees</i>.

<dd>Clearly I don&#39;t have to make a new proposal every time someone disagrees with the existing consensus. I&#39;m not talking about &#34;bold&#34; situations; it&#39;s situations where the matter was discussed and people are ignoring or disputing the consensus. The problem boils down to the fact that we have no way of deciding for sure (in the absence of unanimous agreement or an impartial adjudicator) the answer to two questions in any situation: (1) has consensus been established and for what? (2) what position should be taken if no consensus has been established? Of course in the vast majority of cases people are sensible about these things, but when people on both sides are each convinced they&#39;re being sensible and the others aren&#39;t... well, we know what happens. --<a href="" title="User:Kotniski">Kotniski</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kotniski">talk</a>) 09:02, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

<p>(undent) I think the point of all of this discussion (and many others that I&#39;ve seen) is that consensus works just fine so long as all the editors on the article are interested in being cooperative.  The instant you get one editor who decides that it&#39;s his/her purpose in life (eh, for practical purposes &#39;his&#39; will do) to <b>make some damned point</b>, consensus simply can&#39;t work any more.  no matter how hard you try to achieve consensus on a page like that, you won&#39;t do it.  in the case of a single editor who&#39;s sufficiently troll-like, administrative action may solve the problem (not by achieving consensus, but by disposing of the viewpoint along with the troublemaker); on pages where a number of editors occupy both sides, even that won&#39;t work (because any administrative action against one editor will be seen as unjust, and will only serve to fuel the efforts of his compadres).  </p>
<p>now really, in more normal contexts there are built-in mechanisms for controlling this problem.  in social situations, the face-to-face nature of things keeps people from completely entrenching themselves in their opinions (people are generally too cautious and respectful to look their friends and neighbors in the eye and call them &#39;scum-sucking POV-pushers&#39;; and when they lose their temper and do it anyway the entire group will intercede, physically if necessary, to restore civility).  In political situations, participants are self-conscious of being in public; political actors need to maintain their reputation as someone who is (insert your favorite ideal here), and won&#39;t engage in behavior that makes people think otherwise.  wikipedia, though, has institutionalized the worst aspects of social interaction: actual interactions are among small groups of 2 to 10 people (that&#39;s about as many as you&#39;re likely to see consistently editing on a page) which increases the likelihood of personal issues and decreases the social pressures against acting out; all participants have anonymity, which (again) decreases the social pressures against acting out; all conversations are ostensibly private (to the extent that no one knows what&#39;s happening unless they look, and few people will look at any given page at any given moment), but open to intense surveillance (since all conversations are saved and available to everyone) -this is essentially the design that modern prisons are built on; authority is decentralized and individualized (with the natural ramifications that it is abrupt and punitive in the short term, and being painfully slow at redressing any problems it causes). in short, it&#39;s a system that gives maximum benefits to people who are aggressive, uncompromising, and opinionated, but gives little to no support to people who are reasonable, thoughtful, and cooperative.</p>
<p>that&#39;s nobody&#39;s fault, really: WP was designed with with more normal contexts in mind, and no one considered that the restraining factors of normal communication contexts wouldn&#39;t apply here.  but still... </p>
<p>I&#39;m really tempted to try making some constructive point at this moment, but, you know, I just don&#39;t feel like it.  maybe later.  --<a href="" title="User_talk:Ludwigs2">&#60;span style=&#34;color:darkblue;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;Ludwigs&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:green;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;2&#60;/span&#62;</a> 03:36, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>Much of Ludwigs&#39; analysis is correct; however, what&#39;s missing is, indeed, the &#34;constructive point.&#34; In normal operation, the distributed decision-making, self-selected, works <i>most of the time.</i> However, when a dedicated POV-pusher appears, on side, or a &#34;virtual cabal&#34; of editors sits on an article, excluding a POV, it can break down. To return to the original question, limitations on edit warring cause a defacto majority vote effect. I define edit warring as insistence upon particular content (or removal of content) through repetitive edits, and I include in this the situation where the edits may be new editors, i.e., 1RR. 1RR edit warring can be legitimate, <i>but</i> it should always reflect rough consensus, at a minimum, and, more to the extended point here, it should be accompanied by sincere and patient efforts to find complete consensus. Complete consensus is frequently more accessible than some suspect, most &#34;POV-pushers,&#34; if they are civil and have any understanding of Wikipedia at all, will concede points when they know those points can&#39;t gain consensus. In return, they will often be satisfied with something that may not be ideal to other editors, but which is within guidelines and policy and which, again, if editors on the other side are also sincere, etc., will satisfy them. In the long run, editors who won&#39;t accept reasonable compromises end up being banned.</dd>
<dd>When edit warring appears with an article, <a href="" title="WP:DR">dispute resolution guidelines</a> suggest involving a neutral editor. There are editors who are skilled at dispute resolution, at facilitating consensus among parties who might initially be, virtually, at each other&#39;s throats. Some administrators, having tools to block, may use them, which isn&#39;t terribly effective at finding consensus, and which can create more disruption. On the other hand, short blocks can get the attention of an editor who doesn&#39;t respond to warnings and advice. A clue as to whether or not a block was effective is the result: did edit warring stop and constructive efforts begin? was it replaced with other disruption, such as vandalism or socking? In my view, blocks should always be accompanied by sincere efforts to assist the editor in what is legitimate about what the editor wants to do, to bring the editor into a cooperative, community effort. And that may also requires addressing the other side, the editors who didn&#39;t violate 3RR, maybe because there were two of them!</dd>
<dd>However, Wikipedia process can be excruciatingly inefficient. That will be addressed, long-term, by better structure; the classic solution would be top-down hierarchy, but I think we could build a bottom-up hierarchy, the kind that would be generated spontaneously with a tool like <a href="" title="WP:PRX">WP:PRX</a>. The time is not ripe to describe this in more detail here, but one comment: PRX was not about proxy voting. It was about creating a documentable hierarchy, a communications network that could efficiently compensate for participation bias, and bring necessary attention to any problem, without bringing <i>excessive attention,</i> i.e., wasting the time and creating distraction for many editors and encouraging snap judgments and ignorant comments.

<p>At this point I&#39;d like to summarize the issue:</p>
<p>When there&#39;s clear consensus for something, it&#39;s generally adopted, and most dissenters have the sense to not edit war over it, since they&#39;ll get blocked, or banned if they persist.  </p>
<p>Things are trickier when the community is pretty closely split on an issue.  Pmanderson&#39;s mention of the BC/BCE feud highlights what the outcome of these situations usually is: in the absence of a true consensus, we state in our guidance that there is no consensus over the issue, and merely insist that each side stop warring over it.  We mandate a split: some of you will do it this way, some of you will do it that way, and if you take it upon yourself to force everything to be one way or the other, you will be banned.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re a partisan in the dispute, that&#39;s an intolerable outcome.  But if you&#39;re a person for whom the issue isn&#39;t <a href="" title="Wikipedia:The Most Important Thing Possible">The Most Important Thing Possible</a>, the only thing that&#39;s important is that the disruption associated with the dispute is ended.</p>
<p>Now, will the feud over delinking end this way?  I don&#39;t know; there seems to be a consensus for at least some forms of delinking, but for certain other actions, I see too many objections being raised.  When you see something like that, you know consensus has not been achieved.  The current arbcom case regarding the issue might produce a truce, and might not.  If the war rages on, though, it&#39;ll end up before arbcom again.</p>
<p>So, long story short: sometimes consensus cannot be achieved, but one way or another, warring will be brought to a halt.--<a href="" title="User:Father Goose">Father Goose</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Father Goose">talk</a>) 22:28, 3 March 2009 (UTC)</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Proposal">Proposal</span></h3>
<p>ok, I&#39;m going to toss out something constructive this time. I suspect it will be considered a radical suggestion, but whatever...  it&#39;s designed to be a long-term solution to this problem, rather than a patch, and with that in mind maybe something radical is called for.  I&#39;ll describe it first, then give a short rationale.</p>
<p>the suggestion: <b>institutionalize article ownership</b>.</p>
<p>it would work like this:
</p>
<ul>
<li>have a consensus process for establishing 1-3 editors as &#39;article owners&#39;.  in the simplest case, someone can just request it and get the status officially after a few days; if there&#39;s a contest then it can be handled by RfC</li>
<li>have a consensus process for changing &#39;article owners&#39;.  something that allows an editor to suggest that he might do a better job with the article</li>
<li>have a &#39;no confidence&#39; process for removing article owners peremptorily (this can be a consensus vote by interested editors who think the page is falling apart, or of course an administrative decision)</li></ul>

<p>Article owners would have the following rights, restrictions, and responsibilities
</p>
<ul>
<li>it would be their job to make sure the article is neutral, properly sourced, accurate, and otherwise consistent with policy.  this means:
<ul>
<li>they would have final (authoritative) say on all edits.  no more endless talk page bickering.</li>
<li>they would receive special attention from admins with regards to enforcing their decisions on the article and talk page</li>
<li>they would get an extra grace on 3rr rules for that article</li>
<li>they&#39;d get their wikipedia name on the talk page as owner (or as historical owner if they move on to other pages)</li></ul></li>
<li>They have the following restrictions
<ul>
<li>They cannot be owner on more than one or two articles at a time</li>
<li>they cannot act as admins (if they have that status) on pages where they have ownership.</li></ul></li>
<li>if they fail to live up to their responsibilities (meaning they lost a &#39;no confidence&#39; vote by other editors, or a decision from on high determined that the article was failing wikipedia policy standards), they suffer the following penalties
<ul>
<li>possible ban of reasonable length from owning other articles (or being removed from other articles they currently own) depending on context.</li>
<li>topic-ban of reasonable length from editing that article and related articles</li>
<li>possible loss of other status they have on wikipedia (such as adminship) because of loss of trust.</li></ul></li></ul>

<p>the idea here is that a particular editor could see a problematic article, take ownership, fix the page, and then when the page is stable give up ownership and move on to another page.  in this process s/he would <i>need</i> to reach for some kind of consensus (or risk being voted out, topic-banned, and forever after having his/her wikipedia reputation tarnished), but the authoritative tools necessary to make sure the consensus sticks would be available.  I mean, basically this is what happens on articles anyway - there&#39;s always 1 or 2 or 3 editors doing most of the work, with a few kibitzers helping out; this suggestion just admits that and formalizes it so that it privileges editors who are knowledgeable about the topic and <i>want</i> to improve the article.  It would cut down tremendously on the urge to engage in pointless, heated debates (there&#39;s no value, since the article owner can just ignore them); it would prevent articles from getting trashed as editors squabble over issues (since the owner can just quash article revisions until something&#39;s been worked out on the talk page), and it would tie the owner&#39;s sense of pride and his public image to the quality of the article as a whole (as opposed to the current situation, where these are only tied to presenting one&#39;s own views).  better system all around.  --<a href="" title="User_talk:Ludwigs2">&#60;span style=&#34;color:darkblue;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;Ludwigs&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:green;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;2&#60;/span&#62;</a> 19:10, 3 March 2009 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Worth discussing. It is indeed a radical change of policy, in the direction of Citizendium.</li>
<li>One problem is illustrated by the page that actually set off this post: <a href="" title="WP:BTW">WP:BTW</a> is a guideline; do we want owners for guidelines? If so, they will tend, even more than now to become one editor&#39;s opinion, while still claiming to be &#60;ominous drumroll&#62; Wikipedia policy. </li>
<li>In article space, I guarantee that a large proportion of the volunteers to own pages will be POV-pushers. They don&#39;t think they deserve the penalties, or are willing to risk them, because they&#39;re Defending the Truth. <a href="" title="User:Pmanderson">Septentrionalis</a> &#60;small&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Pmanderson">PMAnderson</a>&#60;/small&#62; 19:51, 3 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>with respect to your first question (ownership of policy and guideline pages) I&#39;d say sure!  with, of course, commensurately greater risks.  I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people who would love to get at and edit core policy with impunity, but I&#39;m not sure how many of them would do it when a vote of &#39;no confidence&#39; could (for instance) get all their work on the policy reverted and earn them a permanent ban from Wikipedia.  You couldn&#39;t possibly use ownership of a guideline or policy to make radical changes - if other editors didn&#39;t boot you before the electronic ink dried, the foundation would see to it.  the only thing you could do as the owner of a policy or guideline would be cleanup, clarification, and small changes that have almost no opposition.  plus, this would obviate a tremendous number of silly debates on policy talk pages. there&#39;s no longer any reason to discuss whether this change or that change represents &#39;consensus&#39;; there is one person whose responsibility is to decide whether an edit has consensus, and if s/he makes a bad choice s/he&#39;s a historical disgrace.  the only people who&#39;d <i>want</i> that kind of risk are people who are really interested in making policy better and people who are really interested in making names for themselves on wikipedia.  those kinds of people are not likely to push povs.  just to give an example, I myself would be really hesitant to take on ownership of a policy page, and if I did take ownership of one I&#39;d treat the darned think like it was a baby.  I get enough people gunning for me, don&#39;t need any more.   </dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>with respect to your other point (POV-pushers owning pages) - true.  but again, lets say (for an example) that some highly opinionated fringe advocate takes ownership of an article.  well, if that editor tries to push a pov, how long do you think it will take the good people at the fringe noticeboard to start a &#39;no confidence&#39; vote? likewise, if an anti-fringe editor takes charge of the article afterward and tries to turn it into a debunk-fest, how long before people from the other side start a no confidence vote of their own?  this may happen several times on contentious articles, with the net result that (a) we&#39;ll eventually get an editor in charge who can survive a no confidence vote from either side (by keeping in line with policy and balancing opinions to get something like consensus) and (b) the worst pov-pushers have already tried ownership, failed, and been temporarily topic-banned, which makes it much easier for the remaining reasonable editors to discuss things.</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>harsh?  maybe.  but would it be effective?  it&#39;s designed to neutralize or penalize aggressive, solipsistic behavior, and reward people who act with consensus and the community in mind.  of course, this all makes wikipedia much more overtly political, but then (pardon my saying so) wikipedia as it stands has a bad case of political denial.  overt politics is much easier to cope with than the kind of back-door wikipolitics that infests the system now. --<a href="" title="User_talk:Ludwigs2">&#60;span style=&#34;color:darkblue;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;Ludwigs&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:green;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;2&#60;/span&#62;</a> 22:10, 3 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>Ok the sarcasm may have been unfair as your proposal was an honest try to sort this out. The core of my objection remains. Eliminating edit war in favour of article ownership will introduce non-neutral point of view (imagine in extremis the Taliban article being &#34;owned&#34; by Taliban warriors.

<dd>as I said, I didn&#39;t expect this idea to be adopted, but the reason for that expectation (or lack thereof?) is not that the idea is wrong, but that it&#39;s novel to most wikipedians.  of course, it&#39;s not really novel; basically what I&#39;m suggesting is an adaptation of parliamentary representation to a task other than governance.  what we have on wikipedia currently (if I were to give it a name) is something like nihilistic democracy (that&#39;s a step short of anarchy: it guarantees many freedoms &#39;to&#39; do things, but it doesn&#39;t do a very good job at guaranteeing our freedoms &#39;from&#39; various kinds of ills), and like most forms of semi-anarchy it works well where people are already predisposed to get along, but not so well where they are not.  what I&#39;ve aimed for here is a way to work the ultimate goal of wikipedia - to make a credible encyclopedia - back into the politics that already runs most pages, so that it supplants other goals.  I mean, let&#39;s be frank: as it stands, wikipedia already has page ownership, almost as a rule.  sometimes it&#39;s implicit and innocuous (i.e., somebody works on a page, nobody much notices and no one complains, and so the page is defacto owned); sometimes it&#39;s more explicit (e.g. two or three editors battle out on a page to achieve what each one thinks is a neutral article and come to a compromise, and then resent any new party that tries to upset the balance).  editors are always going to be thinking that they own articles that they&#39;ve put a lot of effort into, even when they know they don&#39;t <i>really</i> own it.  by making that defacto ownership explicit, and making continued ownership (and other prideful things) dependent on the production of a good article, we get all that energy that would normally be directed into squabbling over trivialities redirected into producing an article that excels.  if you add extra rewards (kudos for page owners whose articles get Featured Article status, and stuff like that) you could radically improve the quality of the encyclopedia overnight.  </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>this works by acknowledging the weaknesses of the participants in the system, and then adapting the system so that those weaknesses pull to the system&#39;s advantage.  democratic systems have been doing it since they were invented.  I mean seriously; if Taliban warriors invade the Taliban article, they have a choice - push their POV and fairly quickly get booted from the article (it&#39;s not like it&#39;s an actual place they where they can dig in, you know), OR if they want to keep control of the article, they produce something that other people can accept and agree to.  it might have a slight slant (what article doesn&#39;t?), but they can&#39;t have a <i>real</i> bias or they&#39;ll lose control.  in short (1) they have a desire to make a certain point (2) they can&#39;t make that point <i>at all</i> unless they do it in a way that others approve of, so (3) they start listening, compromising, keeping within the bounds of policy, and in other ways acting like good wikipedians, just so they can keep making their point.  which seems like a fine result, no?  --<a href="" title="User_talk:Ludwigs2">&#60;span style=&#34;color:darkblue;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;Ludwigs&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:green;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;2&#60;/span&#62;</a> 23:31, 3 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>(in reply to Kotniski up above)I think that the existing situation is best because when it succeeds it depends on the majority of editors being fair-minded and honest in the majority of situations, which I think is the status quo and is likely to remain the status quo.</p>
<p>As far as I can see, any other solution would involve giving a small number of editors (say, the admins) some sort of special authority.  Then the efficacy of the system would depend on that small group of editors <i>always</i> being pure of heart, which I do not think would be a state of affairs that would occur very frequently if at all.  I&#39;ve already come across several really bad admins in my time here and I would only expect that number to increase if being an admin conferred any actual authority.  And the larger the number of bad admins, the more the system would in general break down - lots of basic processes would stop working.</p>
<p>Hence I think that while imperfect this system is better than anything other than a benevolent dictatorship.  I don&#39;t think that a benevolent dictatorship is possible for anything but the most fleeting period of time and I think that people simply wouldn&#39;t be willing to donate their time and effort to any form of a dictatorship.  People believe in Wikipedia and donate their time to it <i>because</i> it&#39;s a functioning egalitarian system. --<a href="" title="User:Struthious_Bandersnatch">❨Ṩtruthious <b>ℬ</b>andersnatch❩</a> 22:51, 4 March 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>This is a slippery slope any which way one sees it, and I&#39;m surprised that editors would even consider it at all. Ownership of articles (in any degree) would create far more problems than it would purportedly solve. Instruction creep in the general direction of &#34;I own this information and no one else should be able to change it without my consent&#34; is, to put it mildly, utterly against the stated goal of building a <b>collaborative</b> body of knowledge. There are enough problems with users being fearful of admin involvement in content disputes, and here we want to create a new class of administrator dedicated solely to control of content?

<dl>
<dd>well, that&#39;s a strawman argument, and not at all what I suggested.  again, please criticize the proposal for what it actually is, rather than a hyperbolic vision of what it might be.  and please take this more as a philosophical discussion than an <i>actual</i> proposal, because you and I both know this will not <i>actually</i> enter into policy (at least, not without a tremendous amount of debate).</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>that being said, I understand your point.  there is a particular idealized version of how Wikipedia works (one which involves editors getting together collaboratively to create a body of knowledge which is fair, comprehensive, accurate, and neutral <i>precisely because</i> it encompasses a broad and extensive set of viewpoints - anyone can edit, so any perspective that&#39;s held by a significant number of anyone&#39;s will be represented.  that is a beautiful ideal, which has been advocated by democratic theorists and spiritual communitarians since (at least) the dawn of Greek civilization.  you&#39;ll notice, however, that in the real world this kind of egalitarian &#39;multocracy&#39; has never existed, except for a few short term implementations in small (i.e. &#60; two or three thousand people) agricultural communities, and Aristotle believed they were the <i>worst</i> form of government imaginable.  in the real world, democracy is always representative democracy (where a small group of people, each with their own local interests, represents the larger community), and <i>good</i> representative democracies bind the interests of the representatives to the interests of the community, so that their own egos serve the greater good.  you&#39;ll also notice that the strength of commercial encyclopedias is that they hire individuals who stake their livelihood and professional reputation on being fair, comprehensive, accurate, and neutral.  the main failing of the wikipedia ideal is that it ignores the fact that there are a significant number of people in the world who operate on a less-than-idealistic framework; they won&#39;t respond to the ideal, won&#39;t work within its bounds, and can&#39;t be convinced to work towards a better encyclopedia unless there&#39;s something in it for them.  sad, but true.  so, either we cling to the ideal, and find ourselves constantly battling against ideologues, pov-pushers, hard-core vandals and the like, or we try to develop something practical which harnesses those self-interested efforts to the benefit of the encyclopedia.  --<a href="" title="User_talk:Ludwigs2">&#60;span style=&#34;color:darkblue;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;Ludwigs&#60;/span&#62;&#60;span style=&#34;color:green;font-weight:bold&#34;&#62;2&#60;/span&#62;</a> 21:22, 5 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>Edit warring certainly &#39;seems&#39; to be the rule of the land. When I started editing my first article 4 days ago I was quite frankly surprised at how blatant it &#39;appeared&#39;. After my initial edits I have been able to spend about 2 hours on further research and editing and more than 24 on <a href="" title="WP:ORN">WP:ORN</a>,<a href="" title="WP:NPOVN">WP:NPOVN</a>,[[WP:RSN] and other boards querying my ability to enhance said article with direct quotes from RS that maintained contextual integrity. It seems that people choose to ignore the very first guideline of <a href="" title="WP:CON">WP:CON</a> namely: Editors use the consensus process to reach agreement regarding how best to implement Wikipedia&#39;s policies and guidelines in any given situation. In my case I was facing multiple editors who reverted my additions with zero arguments and continually tried to evade discussion with an ever increasing torrent of WP:TAGS, all without any hint at how or why they felt they applied to what I did. This was incredibly frustrating, I continually told them that I was a new user and asked for help and guidance. Then, when I read thru the tag soup and applied the contents of the guidelines, policies and Rafrs I was repeatedly accused of sockpuppetry, For Unlawful WP Knowledge. I seriously doubt there are very many newcomers who would stand for it, I think the costs of this entrenched mentality is tremendous. I am sure more intelligent people than myself would have walked away shaking their heads.  I happen to have a history with irc and <a class="externallink" href="http://www-usr.rider.edu/~suler/psycyber/psycyber.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://www-usr.rider.edu/~suler/psycyber/psycyber.html">psychological artifacts</a> of online environments. So I took it all in stride and trusted that eventually wikipolicy would get everyone back to the table. My case could be an outlier since it deals with a controversial article, yet (I feel) the information I tried to add was not *in* controversy and I hoped that meant something. In the end I think that there is a certain tendency to ignore that the actual policy and guideline statements that lie behind words like WP:consensus , WP:NPOV and WP:disruptive are not directly inferable from definitions they might be used to from everyday English. There is perhaps also a more worrying tendency to &#39;pick and choose&#39; rather than being intellectually honest (or aware, like I could be guilty of). Anyway, I am happy to see that there is a discussion about this on here.  &#60;small&#62;&#60;span class=&#34;autosigned&#34;&#62;—Preceding <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="" title="User:Unomi">Unomi</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Unomi">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Unomi">contribs</a>) 05:09, 11 March 2009 (UTC)&#60;/span&#62;&#60;/small&#62;&#60;!-- Template:Unsigned --&#62; &#60;!--Autosigned by SineBot--&#62;</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>While I see some merit in the idea (less people tend to agree quicker), I still have to <b>oppose</b> the proposal. It would lead to Wikipedia devolving into politics further than it already does. People would stuff article owner votes, war over the article owner and article development would grind to a halt if the particular people associated with it were not around. Also, a lot of obscure articles wouldn&#39;t even lead to a discussion. It&#39;s simply too much effort for something that is unlikely to work. If the opposition against flagged revisions that there are too few editors to handle the incoming material has any smidge of truth to it, then it will also apply to this set up in the sense that there simply aren&#39;t enough editors to handle all articles in this fashion.- <a href="" title="User:MacGyverMagic">Mgm</a>|<a href="" title="User talk:MacGyverMagic">&#60;sup&#62;(talk)&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 13:12, 17 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

The consensus to Merge means that the topic is in fact <i>not</i> notable enough to merit its own article -- and yet we say it should be kept. This seems contradictory. Articles lacking notability are in fact supposed to be deleted, whether or not their content merits mention elsewhere.</p>
<p>AfD is currently useless for the type of notability issue where even though the topic may merit mention in another article, the topic isn&#39;t notable on its own.</p>
<p>Merge closings are often accompanied by a rider that says the merits of the merge should be discussed on the article&#39;s talk page. I say that&#39;s silly. Whether a merge should occur is an issue of notability, which is why editors seek the arbitration of AfD in the first place. When Merge is the closing consensus, that should be <i>enforced</i>, rather than merely saying &#34;Well now that it&#39;s settled I&#39;ll let you go argue about it some more&#34;. A Merge consensus at AfD already shows that the topic isn&#39;t notable, so there shouldn&#39;t be any further discussion required. </p>
<p>Merge is an issue of notability, and notability is an issue for AfD, so the way I see it, AfD closings need to carry the possibility of a Merge decision. Along with officially adding an actual Merge possibility to AfD closings, I propose that one of the following be used to enforce those decisions:
</p>
<ol>
<li>A Merge closing should result in the understanding that the merge must actually be carried out within a set amount of time (say a week or two), and after that time the article will be deleted or redirected, with a template notice to that effect on the article&#39;s talk page.</li>
<li>A Merge closing results in the closing admin immediately replacing the page with a redirect to the article with which it&#39;s to be merged. At the same time, the admin also moves the replaced article content to someone&#39;s userspace (perhaps his own), or to a subpage of the target article, and posts a link to it. This has the benefit of immediately enforcing the Merge while also making it easy for everyone to perform it with no time limit.</li>
<li>A Merge closing results in the closing admin immediately editing the page and adding a redirect to the article with which it&#39;s to be merged. There is no need to move the old content anywhere because it remains in the history of the article and can be accessed by any party interested in doing the merge. (added by) --<a href="" title="User:Philip Baird Shearer">PBS</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Philip Baird Shearer">talk</a>) 09:59, 7 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Current practice, implemented by <a href="" title="User:Mr.Z-man/closeAFD">User:Mr.Z-man/closeAFD</a>: The closing admin places   and   tags on the appropriate pages. Editors implement the merge by copying/integrating the content and redirecting as ordinary editing actions. <a href="" title="User:AnomieBOT">AnomieBOT</a> cleans up leftover &#60;nowiki&#62; &#60;/nowiki&#62; tags. &#60;small&#62;—added by <a href="" title="User:Flatscan">Flatscan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Flatscan">talk</a>) 04:08, 13 March 2009 (UTC)&#60;/small&#62;</li></ol>

<p>A number of recent events have led me to this. I feel that allowing Merge to be a valid conclusion at AfD would avert a lot of unnecessary argument. Please post your thoughts. &#60;small style=&#34;font:bold 10px Arial;display:inline;border:#009 1px dashed;padding:1px 6px 2px 7px;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Equazcion">&#60;font color=&#34;#000&#34;&#62;Equazcion&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:equazcion">•<i>✗</i></a>/<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Equazcion"><i>C</i> •</a> <i>20:31, 6 Mar 2009 (UTC)</i>&#60;/small&#62;</p>

<dd>I&#39;ve tried to suggest that AFDeletion should really be AFDiscussion, since it&#39;s well acknowledged that &#34;merge&#34; and &#34;redirect&#34; are completely valid output options from the discussion, but there&#39;s a strong resistance to introduce these to the process.  Yet a good number of times when merge discussions are limited to the pages of interest, you find a strong resistance to such; a fair merge discussion at AFD is a much better venue for such. --<a href="" title="User:Masem">M&#60;font size=&#34;-3&#34;&#62;ASEM&#60;/font&#62;</a> (<a href="" title="User Talk:Masem">t</a>) 20:40, 6 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>Merges should be performed by persons who have at least some familiarity or interest in the topic. Expecting AfD closers to execute merges is a recipe for very badly done merges. <a href="" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 20:53, 6 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I&#39;m not suggesting the closing admin actually perform the content merge -- only enforce it. &#60;small style=&#34;font:bold 10px Arial;display:inline;border:#009 1px dashed;padding:1px 6px 2px 7px;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Equazcion">&#60;font color=&#34;#000&#34;&#62;Equazcion&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:equazcion">•<i>✗</i></a>/<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Equazcion"><i>C</i> •</a> <i>20:56, 6 Mar 2009 (UTC)</i>&#60;/small&#62;</dd>
<dd>Or instead of usefying it with a redirect (your second option), a subpage of the target page could be made, along with ample talk page notification.

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="comments_.28AfD_debate.29">comments (AfD debate)</span></h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Oppose</b> AFD does what it says on the tin - just settles matters of deletion.  We have <a href="" title="WP:MERGE">WP:MERGE</a> for mergers. <a href="" title="User:Colonel Warden">Colonel Warden</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Colonel Warden">talk</a>) 23:41, 6 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose, on the whole</b> If the merger &#34;must&#34; be carried out, the only person willing to do it, in many cases, will be the creator, who is likely to just dump almost all the article into the one it is merged to, which will often unbalance the merge target. As it is, merges can still be carried out afterwards for &#34;Keeps&#34;, and the content made available by an admin for those who want to save something from a &#34;Delete&#34; (which fortunately most creators of poor articles don&#39;t know). <a href="" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Johnbod">talk</a>) 01:02, 7 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Option 2 in my proposal would not actually force the merging of content in a way that would make for hasty content dumps. Besides which, the prospect that no one is willing to carry out a merge shouldn&#39;t have anything to do with whether a non-notable article is permitted to exist. &#60;small style=&#34;font:bold 10px Arial;display:inline;border:#009 1px dashed;padding:1px 6px 2px 7px;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Equazcion">&#60;font color=&#34;#000&#34;&#62;Equazcion&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:equazcion">•<i>✗</i></a>/<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Equazcion"><i>C</i> •</a> <i>01:09, 7 Mar 2009 (UTC)</i>&#60;/small&#62;</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> The primary question that should be answered at AFD is &#34;should or should not an administrator push a delete button&#34;. That&#39;s why it&#39;s called &#34;articles for deletion&#34;. An article should not be sent there unless the nominator wants that button to be pushed. &#34;Merge&#34; and &#34;redirect&#34; are valid closes but IMHO are secondary alternatives to &#34;keep&#34; or &#34;delete&#34;. If one&#39;s primary goal is to merge then the proper venue for that discussion is the article&#39;s talk page or <a href="" title="WP:PM">WP:PM</a>. As far as <b>Merge</b> closes with a note to discuss it on the talk page, I can&#39;t recall seeing one right off hand. I sometimes use the comment &#34;The discussion wrt merging can continue on the article&#39;s talk page&#34; for a <b>Keep</b> close but I only close like that if there are solid good faith &#34;keep&#34; !votes as well as &#34;merge&#34; !votes. --<a href="" title="User:Ron Ritzman">Ron Ritzman</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Ron Ritzman">talk</a>) 02:09, 7 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>The main question at AfD is, &#34;should WP have an independent article on the topic at hand&#34;? Closing admins need to be careful when judging the discussion to decide if the consensus is for keep or merge, and should close the discussion appropriately. However, there is no need to rush to compelte the merge. Just close the AfD completely, and eventually someone will get around to implementing the merge if that is the outcome. &#38;mdash;&#38;nbsp;Carl &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User:CBM">CBM</a>&#38;nbsp;·&#38;nbsp;<a href="" title="User talk:CBM">talk</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 02:11, 7 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes that is the main question. A merge consensus means WP <i>shouldn&#39;t</i> have an independent article though. If merge defaults to keep, then how is that carrying out the prupose of AfD? &#60;small style=&#34;font:bold 10px Arial;display:inline;border:#009 1px dashed;padding:1px 6px 2px 7px;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Equazcion">&#60;font color=&#34;#000&#34;&#62;Equazcion&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:equazcion">•<i>✗</i></a>/<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Equazcion"><i>C</i> •</a> <i>02:16, 7 Mar 2009 (UTC)</i>&#60;/small&#62;

<li><b>Oppose</b> - It&#39;s called &#34;Articles for <i>deletion</i>&#34;. If the result is anything other than deletion, it should default to keep. &#38;ndash;<a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">Juliancolton</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Juliancolton">&#60;font color=&#34;#66666&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<b>T</b>ropical&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="Special:contributions/Juliancolton">&#60;font color=&#34;#66666&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<b>C</b>yclone&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 02:13, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>I love answers like this. Yes, that is how it works currently, but I just posted a few paragraphs on why it might be a good idea to make a change. Do you have an actual argument against my reasoning? &#60;small style=&#34;font:bold 10px Arial;display:inline;border:#009 1px dashed;padding:1px 6px 2px 7px;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Equazcion">&#60;font color=&#34;#000&#34;&#62;Equazcion&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:equazcion">•<i>✗</i></a>/<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Equazcion"><i>C</i> •</a> <i>02:18, 7 Mar 2009 (UTC)</i>&#60;/small&#62;
<ul>
<li>Yep, I do. :) Under its current title, AfD is to determine whether or not an article needs to be deleted; anything else is irrelevant to the discussion. If/when it&#39;s renamed, I&#39;ll reconsider my opinion. Cheers, &#38;ndash;<a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">Juliancolton</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Juliancolton">&#60;font color=&#34;#66666&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<b>T</b>ropical&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="Special:contributions/Juliancolton">&#60;font color=&#34;#66666&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<b>C</b>yclone&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 04:01, 7 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So the name, that&#39;s your argument. Okee dokee. Well then, I&#39;d be fine with a name change as well if need be, to reflect AfD&#39;s slightly altered purpose should this proposal go through. &#60;small style=&#34;font:bold 10px Arial;display:inline;border:#009 1px dashed;padding:1px 6px 2px 7px;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Equazcion">&#60;font color=&#34;#000&#34;&#62;Equazcion&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:equazcion">•<i>✗</i></a>/<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Equazcion"><i>C</i> •</a> <i>04:03, 7 Mar 2009 (UTC)</i>&#60;/small&#62;
<ul>
<li>I&#39;ve nothing against the proposal. I just think this falls into the category of trying to fix something that ain&#39;t broken. &#38;ndash;<a href="" title="User:Juliancolton">Juliancolton</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Juliancolton">&#60;font color=&#34;#66666&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<b>T</b>ropical&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="Special:contributions/Juliancolton">&#60;font color=&#34;#66666&#34;&#62;&#60;sup&#62;<b>C</b>yclone&#60;/sup&#62;&#60;/font&#62;</a> 04:10, 7 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>A decision of merge is not there should never be a separate article on a subject -- only that an article as currently constituted would be better presented as a topic within the context of another article. <a href="" title="User:Bkonrad">older</a> ≠ <a href="" title="User talk:Bkonrad">wiser</a> 03:42, 7 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Support</b> - Merge, redirect, and anything else that gets consensus has always been a valid outcome, this seems like it would be more in line with the reasoning behind merges. &#60;font face=&#34;Broadway&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.</a><a href="" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man"><b><i>Z-</i></b><i>man</i></a>&#60;/font&#62; 03:56, 7 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b> - AfD is for <b>deletion</b>, any other result is irrelevant to the closing sysop and to the process. Its purpose is simply to decide whether the article should be kept or not. People can then argue about merging or redirecting in a more appropriate venue without the axe hanging over everyone&#39;s neck. A merge or redirect <i>consensus</i> is by definition a keep in the context of an AfD. I do agree that the process is broken, but I think you&#39;re trying to make AfD work in a way it wasn&#39;t designed to. The issue here is that while delete is perfectly enforceable (click a button and <i>poof</i>), merge is not. I feel this is a bit like trying to fix a busted engine block with duct tape - it&#39;s never going to work correctly, because it cannot be enforced. &#60;span style=&#34;color:dimgray; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;&#34;&#62;§<a href="" title="User:FreeRangeFrog">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#007138&#34;&#62;FreeRangeFrog&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62; 04:34, 7 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I&#39;m not sure why it matters that AfD wasn&#39;t <i>designed</i> to work this way. Besides which I don&#39;t even think that&#39;s true. Other consequences besides keep and delete have been acceptable in the past. This &#34;default&#34; thing seems rather recent to me. As for it not being able to work to enforce merges, I just don&#39;t see why not. I&#39;ve proposed two workable (IMO) solutions for it. &#60;small style=&#34;font:bold 10px Arial;display:inline;border:#009 1px dashed;padding:1px 6px 2px 7px;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Equazcion">&#60;font color=&#34;#000&#34;&#62;Equazcion&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:equazcion">•<i>✗</i></a>/<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Equazcion"><i>C</i> •</a> <i>04:38, 7 Mar 2009 (UTC)</i>&#60;/small&#62;</li>
<li>Your solution places the onus on the closing sysop, which is the part I disagree with. &#60;span style=&#34;color:dimgray; font-size: smaller; font-weight: bold;&#34;&#62;§<a href="" title="User:FreeRangeFrog">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#007138&#34;&#62;FreeRangeFrog&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62; 04:56, 7 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, as far as enforcing the merge, that is the admin&#39;s job. I don&#39;t see what the problem is with that. I don&#39;t expect him to actually perform the content merge. &#60;small style=&#34;font:bold 10px Arial;display:inline;border:#009 1px dashed;padding:1px 6px 2px 7px;white-space:nowrap&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Equazcion">&#60;font color=&#34;#000&#34;&#62;Equazcion&#60;/font&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:equazcion">•<i>✗</i></a>/<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Equazcion"><i>C</i> •</a> <i>05:02, 7 Mar 2009 (UTC)</i>&#60;/small&#62;
<ul>
<li>No, it is not.  The job of enforcement of things that require no more than <i>the tools that everyone possesses</i> is <i>everyone&#39;s job</i>.  There&#39;s the well-known human tendency towards laziness, but <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Somebody Else&#39;s Problem">implementing such actions is not Somebody Else&#39;s Problem</a>.  Editing is not a burden for everyone else to impose on a small group of administrators. <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 14:28, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>I support detailed closing rationales and distinguishing between <i>keep</i> and <i>merge</i> if a consensus exists. If a merge discussion happens to take place at AfD, I see no functional difference that would invalidate it. There is a <a href="#Mergers_at_AfD" title="WT:Articles for deletion/Archive 48">previous WT:AFD discussion</a> covering mergers and the validity of <i>merge</i> outcomes. However, the proposed modification may not be necessary: the tags   and   already exist and are in use, with <a href="" title="Special:WhatLinksHere/Template:Afd-merged-from">roughly 100 pages tagged as merged</a>. <a href="" title="User:Flatscan">Flatscan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Flatscan">talk</a>) 04:43, 7 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>It appears that the placement of these tags is incorporated into the AfD closing script(s). I have asked a closer to confirm. <a href="" title="User:Flatscan">Flatscan</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Flatscan">talk</a>) 04:06, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Support</b> all too often consensus exists on an AFD page yet it is not acted upon. It shouldn&#39;t be a technicality that <b>Merge</b> is defaulted to <b>keep</b> and then further discussion must take place. What usually happnes is a sequel to the AFD at the discussion page and nothing really gets sorted out. I&#39;d like to point out that we have <a href="" title="WP:RFD">WP:RFD</a> redirects for discussion as opposed to deletion. I&#39;d say I prefer option one as a time limit would cause more users to work on the merger --<a href="" title="User:DFS454">DFS454</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:DFS454">talk</a>) 09:34, 7 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>It&#39;s not the job of volunteer administrators to be edit-on-demand services.  If someone has a problem with a consensus for performing an ordinary editorial action, which <i>xe xyrself has the tool for enacting</i>, not being implemented, then xe has no leg to stand on if xe doesn&#39;t put xyr edits where xyr mouth is.  This is a volunteer project, and one of the fundamental parts of its &#34;<a href="http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Foundation_issues">anyone can edit</a>&#34; ethos is that the task of editing is distributed across a large number of people, rather than imposed as a burden on a small group.    applies to unfinished mergers that someone wants finished, and has always applied. <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 14:28, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Comment</b> I have added an option (3.) as it is easier to do and it preserves the history of the article (which might be needed for copyright reasons). However there are times when one needs a merge and delete. Sometimes the content of the article is a POV fork,  and the title is POV or OR. For example after the author of an article called <a href="" title="Congo Free State Genocide">Congo Free State Genocide</a> merged the content into <a href="" title="Congo Free State">Congo Free State</a> (adding in the very large negative side of the state (about 10 million killed)),  I deleted the article CFSG as the name was OR (&#34;no reputable historian of the Congo has made charges of genocide&#34;. <a href="" title="Adam Hochschild">Adam Hochschild</a>.<a class="externallink" href="http://www.howardwfrench.com/archives/2005/10/26/in_the_heart_of_darkness/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.howardwfrench.com/archives/2005/10/26/in_the_heart_of_darkness/"><a class="externallink" href="http://www.howardwfrench.com/archives/2005/10/26/in_the_heart_of_darkness/" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.howardwfrench.com/archives/2005/10/26/in_the_heart_of_darkness/">http://www.howardwfrench.com/archives/2005/10/26/in_the_heart_of_darkness/</a></a>).</li>

<li>Although I agree with the sentiment, and understand why this was proposed, I&#39;m going to <b>oppose</b>. There is a distinction between a delete-with-posthumous-redirect and a merge. The only change which is required is to better educate admins as to when the former is more appropriate than the latter - namely, in cases where the non-notable article contains no material which is of encyclopedic value to its merge target. <a href="" title="user:thumperward">Chris Cunningham (not at work)</a> - <a href="" title="user talk:thumperward">talk</a> 13:14, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> – I see two ways of going with this (provided we do not wish to keep things as is). They are the following:
<ul>
<li>Changing to &#34;Articles for discussion&#34; as already done with <a href="" title="WP:CFD">WP:CFD</a> for instance.</li>
<li>Rewording the <a href="" title="WP:DEL">deletion policy</a>, the <a href="" title="WP:AFD">AFD guideline</a>, and adding onto the AFD procedure to ensure that nearly all the articles sent to AFD are there because all efforts for cleanup, merging, redirection, etc., either have been tried or do not apply, depending on the article.</li></ul></li>
<li>Perhaps DEL and AFD need to be reworded to stronger language like it is in <a href="" title="WP:ARBCOM">WP:ARBCOM</a>. For example, taken from <a href="" title="WP:RFAR">WP:RFAR</a> with slight wording: <i>it is expected that other avenues of will have been exhausted before an article is nominated for deletion—Arbitration is the last resort for problematic articles, rather than the first</i>.&#60;p&#62;The AFD process could also be changed into some sort of checklist-style list of requisites, having the nom justify that all other steps have either been tried and failed or does not apply (using <a href="" title="WP:COMMON">common sense</a> of course; a good amount of the time there is no logical place to merge or redirect articles). This could be done in a couple of ways. First, it could be built into the existing AFD template, requiring users to justify why said alternatives were or were not used. A second way would be to, instead of users nominating straight to AFD, there would be some sort of &#34;pre-AFD&#34; where consensus determines that all alternatives have been tried and is cleared to be a candidate for AFD.&#60;p&#62;The biggest problem with my second proposal (I hope I explained it correctly) is that it would likely bring in more <a href="" title="WP:BURO">bureaucratic creep</a>, but it may be necessary if you desire fewer and more clear-cut AFDs than what we normally have. <a href="" title="User talk:MuZemike">MuZemike</a> 23:13, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

<li><b>Support</b> I wholeheatedly agree with the sentiment, and I&#39;m a little perplexed that most of the reasons given for opposing are on procedural grounds. Mostly that the only two outcomes should be keep or delete. But there are three common outcomes: keep, delete and keep and merge. I think the question is why there can&#39;t be a merge and delete? Instead of deleting the article outright, the admin could change it to a redirect, allowing the text to be available for merging. What&#39;s the alternative? Under the current system, merge=keep, whether they get merged or not. I don&#39;t see why that&#39;s not sillier than the proposal. The only other proposal that makes sense is to not count &#34;merge&#34; votes. Or if you really want to play the system, copy the text to the other article, then vote delete as a content fork. -<a href="" title="User:Freekee">Freekee</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Freekee">talk</a>) 01:23, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>The &#34;default&#34; is not a default.  It&#39;s implicit in the very nature of merger.  And it has been that way <i>all along</i>, at the very least since I wrote <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion&#38;oldid=10529479#Incompatible_votes" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Guide_to_deletion&#38;oldid=10529479#Incompatible_votes">the very first version</a> of the <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Guide to deletion">Wikipedia:Guide to deletion</a>.  <b>AFD is for <i>deletion</i>.</b>  Merger discussions have no reason to be held to a rapid 5-day timetable, and imposing such a timetable upon them would be to pressurize editors for no good reason.&#60;p&#62;AFD is already one of the most heavily trafficked parts of the project, and for <i>more than half a decade now</i> our every effort, from adding speedy deletion (in the first place!) to creating the Proposed Deletion mechanism, has been aimed at <i>keeping that traffic down</i>, not raising it.  Increased volume results in less participation, and less participation risks, and results in, bad decisions.  (AFD relies upon the <a href="" title="Swiss Cheese model">Swiss Cheese model</a> in order to come to the correct result.)  And <i>the same is true for merger discussions</i>.  Holding merger discussions to an arbitrary 5-day timetable, instead of the current timetable which is entirely flexible on a discussion-by-discussion basis, reduces participation, and incurs exactly the same risks.&#60;p&#62;The correct way to address this closure issue is to encourage individual editor responsibility.  After all, that is a fundamental part of our ethos, too.  Every editor opining an action, that can be carried out with the ordinary editing tools that <i>even editors without accounts have</i>, is responsible for following through on their opinion.  If an editor opines merge, but doesn&#39;t put xyr edits where xyr mouth is when a consensus agrees with that opinion, then xyr opinion is clearly not all that firm and xe has no-one to blame but xyrself for a lack of action.&#60;p&#62;<a href="" title="Wikipedia:Somebody Else&#39;s Problem">This is not Somebody Else&#39;s Problem</a>.    applies to completing and to enacting mergers as much as it does to any other ordinary editorial actions with ordinary editing tools. <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 14:28, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Oppose</b>. If the result is &#34;merge&#34; that means the decision is that the content is worth keeping in some form, just somewhere else. Therefore, we can assume it meets basic verifiability requirements, and is not really doing any harm as it stands. Merging it will make the overall coverage much tidier, but deleting it removes the information; a far more drastic measure.

<ul>
<li>Hello to all. I have a general question stemming, of course, from a specific example (please see <a href="" title="Oral rehydration therapy">Oral rehydration therapy</a> and related talk page). I am unclear regarding the difference between vandalism that is defined by the second paragraph of the <a href="" title="WP:VAN">WP:VAN</a> policy and <a href="" title="WP:EW">edit-warring</a>. The section of interest within the second paragraph states: <i>adding a controversial personal opinion to an article once is not vandalism; reinserting it despite multiple warnings is.</i> This also seems to fit within the general definition of <a href="" title="WP:EW">edit-warring</a>, and on the policy page for edit-warring, (<a href="#What_is_edit_warring.3F" title="WP:EW">section 2, third paragraph</a>), it clearly states that edit-warring is not vandalism. How does one make this distinction in general? I would also welcome any comments or thoughts surrounding the specific example I gave (on its respective <a href="" title="Talk:Oral rehydration therapy">talk page</a>, of course). Thanks! <a href="" title="User:Chaldor">Chaldor</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Chaldor">talk</a>) 10:46, 4 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>I feel I can respond best by phrasing my response based solely on what is in your post (without referring to the policy pages or your cited example). &#34;Reinserting it despite multiple warnings&#34; to me indicates that the user in question has been warned <i>on his or her own talk page,</i> probably (though not necessarily) by an admin or an uninvolved third party, not to readd the content without supporting citations and/or talk page consensus. <a href="" title="User:Dansiman"><b>&#60;font color=&#34;#AA9933&#34;&#62;D&#60;font color=&#34;#716622&#34;&#62;a&#60;font color=&#34;#393311&#34;&#62;n&#60;font color=&#34;#000000&#34;&#62;si&#60;/font&#62;m&#60;/font&#62;a&#60;/font&#62;n&#60;/font&#62;</b></a> (&#60;font color=&#34;#aa9933&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User_Talk:Dansiman">talk</a>&#60;/font&#62;|&#60;font color=&#34;#aa9933&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Dansiman">Contribs</a>&#60;/font&#62;) 16:01, 5 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>In my opinion, the difference is the motivation behind it, as good faith edits are never vandalism. Generally edit wars are between multiple good faith contributors fighting for what they perceive to be the best version of the article, whereas a vandal is repeatedly adding controversial material in a bad faith attempt to make the article worse or just to cause a ruckus for their own amusement. From the first paragraph, one can conclude that someone edit warring is only a vandal if they are making &#34;a <i>deliberate</i> attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia.&#34; Due to the fact that we must <a href="" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a>, edit warriors who are not adding obvious vandalism (so and so are gay/a Nazi/pedophile/etc.) should generally be given the benefit of the doubt and be warned and blocked for <a href="" title="WP:3RR">three revert rule violations</a> rather than vandalism.--<a href="" title="User:Dycedarg">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid red;color:red; padding:1px;background:#000&#34;&#62;<b>Dycedarg</b>&#60;/span&#62;</a> <a href="" title="User talk:Dycedarg"><b>&#60;span style=&#34;color:#000000&#34;&#62;&#38;#x0436;&#60;/span&#62;</b></a> 00:03, 9 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>What I gather from these two replies is that the <i>reinserting it despite multiple warnings</i> policy is more like a corner case than anything else. The feeling I get is that one is to always assume the change is in good faith unless it is obvious reinsertion of content by a known editor that has an established past history of inserting this content despite consensus and notices otherwise. Is this understanding correct? If so, then we might consider rewording this sentence a little (or perhaps looking for a better example) because, as it stands, I feel it is open to a more lenient interpretation than what I gather the consensus for the distinction between these two aspects is. <a href="" title="User:Chaldor">Chaldor</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Chaldor">talk</a>) 04:45, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<li>I think if people are wishing to remove red-links from an article, either by changing them to plain text or erasing all mention of the potential topic (deleting entire lines from a list, for example), they should at least have to reasonably establish a lack of sources to create a separate article and a lack of a suitable page to redirect to, but even then they will be wrong in many cases. — <a href="" title="User talk:CharlotteWebb">CharlotteWebb</a> 12:31, 8 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>The reason for removing date links is that they did not represent useful semantic links, but were just used for formatting. There should never be any reason to remove redlinks that are to relevant and potentially notable subjects. Doing so creates greater orphan problems and hides demand for new articles. Aesthetic reasons are irrelevant, as all users can change their css to whatever they like.

<dd>Redlinks do two things. One, they show a potential editor that there&#39;s a topic that needs an article, and two, they provide instant linkage to many articles when the article is finally created.  Someone complained that there are redlinks for articles that shouldn&#39;t exist. These should be deleted, and I don&#39;t imagine this is such a serious problem that it should be enforced with a technical solution. Docu, you are wrong when you say that &#34;Once there are no more any red links, growth would stop.&#34; You&#39;re seeing a cause and effect where it doesn&#39;t exist in the Growth Study.

<dd>I like redlinks also,  I think they should stay visible for those that choose not to override it themselves. I think <a href="" title="User:Father_Goose">Father Goose</a> exemplifies the value of keeping redlinks visible, also, leaving the actual links intact means that we aren&#39;t reduced to redoing linking that was already there when the article is eventually created. I don&#39;t see a huge problem with anon users being met with an enticing suggestion to sign up and be BOLD if they happen to click on a red link. Chances are that people who click on links are interested in what *should* be at the other end of it, if a few take the time to do a little research outside of wikipedia and post their findings back to where they thought they would find the information in the first place, so much the better. I think the removal of redlinks should be discouraged as per CharlotteWebb. I am also opposed to the idea that wikipedia is &#39;nearing completion&#39; and even that there are articles we can a priori judge should not exist. <a href="" title="User:Unomi">Unomi</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Unomi">talk</a>) 08:09, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>If it is purely a cosmetic issue, if people don&#39;t like the red due to <a href="" title="red letter edition">religious undertones</a>, <a href="" title="The Scarlet Letter">marital infidelity</a>, and/or <a href="" title="red-green color blindness">red-green color blindness</a>, we could always pick a different color by redefining &#60;tt&#62;class=&#34;new&#34;&#60;/tt&#62; in the CSS. This wouldn&#39;t bother me as long as it was easily distinguishable from other types of links, and from plain text. My only concern is that such a change would cause confusion when experienced users continue to use the same deeply ingrained metonym of &#34;<a href="" title="red link">red link</a>&#34; long after the color has changed (I mean even the software uses this term, see &#60;tt&#62;&#38;redlink=1&#60;/tt&#62; in the url).</dd>
<dd>But if it&#39;s anything other than that, such as a conscious effort to discourage new articles, we have a more serious problem. — <a href="" title="User talk:CharlotteWebb">CharlotteWebb</a> 15:15, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>The whole idea anons cannot create articles is wrong. Even if they choose not to log in, they can submit articles through <a href="" title="WP:AFC">WP:AFC</a>. Removing redlinks purely for aesthetic reasons is bad too since that is in the eye of the beholder. Redlinks are supposed to encourage article creation and make sure that upon creation, the editor doesn&#39;t have to go around and create a whole list of links. Aesthetics can be handled through other means (like css) without compromising the good things redlinks bring.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Questions_re_citations">Questions re citations</span></h2>


<ol>
<li>Is there such a thing as a fact being so obvious that a request for citation can be ignored? I am thinking of the concept of judicial notice. The court will take notice of all sorts of facts such as 3+2=5, or when something falls it travels in a downword direction, or a US Navy chart of sunrise/sunset is reasonably accurate.</li>
<li>What do I do when a request for citation is ambiguous? Example: &#34;Most people believe that there is no such thing as ghosts, although some people think they do exist.&#34;   I can think of at least 4 facts that the request for citation may be referring to.</li>
<li>When a request for a cite has been around for a year or so and nobody  ever gave a citation or deleted any facts, can it be removed on the grounds that it is stale? <a href="" title="User:Phil burnstein">Phil_burnstein</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Phil burnstein">talk</a>) 11:19, 9 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ol>

<dd><a href="" title="WP:V">WP:V</a> gives the policy. Attribution to persons and any statements that are likely to be challenged require a citation. That 3+2=5 is unlikely to be challenges so requires no cite. The example given would be better tagged as &#34;Most people  believe that there is no such thing as ghosts, although some people  think they do exist.&#34; What is required is a required source that verifies this entire statement (which is a statement of what people think, not of the actual existence of ghosts). As for old tags, I would think it&#39;s better to leave them in, in order to warn readers and other editors that the statement has not been verified (and encourage them to find a source). <a href="" title="User:OrangeDog">OrangeDog</a> &#60;small&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:OrangeDog">talk</a> • <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/OrangeDog">edits</a>)&#60;/small&#62; 11:50, 9 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Essentially, a &#34;citation needed&#34; tag is just another edit to the article; and the same rules apply - if you think it&#39;s wrong or unnecessary, by all means remove it.

<dd>A {fact} tag &#38;ndash; like any other &#39;maintenance&#39;-type tag &#38;ndash; shouldn&#39;t be removed until the problem it highlights is resolved.  In practice, that means either a reference is supplied, the fact in question is deemed sufficiently obvious that a reference would be overkill (2 + 3 = 5, per your example), the dubious material has been removed, or the placement of the tag is in error. </dd>
<dd>That last case can come up in a few ways.  Someone may have edited the text in such a way as to obviate the need for the tag.  The person who placed the tag may have inadvertently put it in the wrong place during a long editing binge.  It may be unclear which fact is in question.  If you see a floating fact tag that couldn&#39;t reasonably apply to anything around it, then feel free to delete it.  If the tag should be moved or made more specific (using the {who} tag, for instance) then do that.  If the tag is a recent addition and you can identify the editor who placed it, you can always ask them on their talk page what they intended to flag.

<p>Now links to this same website is showing up once again on various articles and I&#39;m removing them again, this time not assuming good faith anymore.

<dd>Hi there!  I&#39;m Jaynee7283 and I&#39;m the editor of ScoopMill.  I wanted to write and apologize if it seems as though I was spamming Wikipedia - that was not my intent.  ScoopMill is a community website about Fort Mill, Tega Cay and Indian Land - three closely connected towns in SC (if you&#39;ll see my &#34;About Our Area&#34; page you&#39;ll see I list all three towns).  Those were the ONLY pages on which I put my link - I honestly do not recall placing the link on any other pages and apologize that someone else did.  As I said in a followup email to Fife last night, my website is an informational website that provides residents and newcomers with information about the towns - including lists of government agencies, churches, restaurants, doctors, local events, and civic organizations.  It also has a blog which encourages locals to talk back about local news/events.  In that regard, I felt it was a beneficial link to have on the FM, TC and IL pages since those searching for info on Wikipedia would likely be well-served by the information provided on ScoopMill.  I am very sorry for any links appearing on any pages other than the FM, TC and IL pages.  I still feel that the website has good cause to be linked on the town pages toward which ScoopMill is geared.  Thanks for your consideration.  <a href="" title="User:Jaynee7283">Jaynee7283</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Jaynee7283">talk</a>) 14:09, 17 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>There&#39;s nothing wrong with citing or referring to policy in discussions. Controversial and long-running issues like this can easily denigrate to editors simply throwing tags at each other. Normally in these kind of cases I&#39;d advise going for a <a href="" title="WP:RFC">request for comments</a>, but in your case I&#39;d also recommend looking at Wikipedia&#39;s policy on <a href="" title="WP:MULTIPLE">multiple accounts</a>. — <a href="" title="User:Blue-Haired Lawyer">Blue-Haired Lawyer</a> 13:32, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree that citing or referring policy is not wrong, further I venture it is the right thing to do. The problem is that they do not try to explain how they feel that I am in violation, or more appropriately, how my edits are in violation of policy. I have asked them on numerous occasions to tell me *how* it violates policy. If they do not do that then I cannot know how to rectify it. Discussion should constructive and based around how to improve material or be able to argue for why it must be dismissed. At least that is my understanding, am I wrong? </dd>
<dd>As an example note orangemarlins <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAspartame_controversy&#38;diff=276475190&#38;oldid=276415830" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAspartame_controversy&#38;diff=276475190&#38;oldid=276415830">reply</a> to <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAspartame_controversy&#38;diff=276387074&#38;oldid=276281760" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Talk%3AAspartame_controversy&#38;diff=276387074&#38;oldid=276281760">this</a>. An attempt at explaining my position reduced to <a href="" title="WP:NOTAFORUM">WP:NOTAFORUM</a> and the response to the content of my argument is a curt <a href="" title="WP:WEIGHT">WP:WEIGHT</a>. Is that really fair? So now I have to read thru <a href="" title="WP:WEIGHT">WP:WEIGHT</a> to guess what it could have been that orangemarlin meant? I have repeatedly stated that I do not read minds, is that controversial? So I must try to deduce what orangemarlin meant? This becomes untenable as I am not able to judge orangemarlins ability to correctly parse and apply <a href="" title="WP:WEIGHT">WP:WEIGHT</a>, certainly orangemarlin showed either <a href="" title="WP:NOCLUE">WP:NOCLUE</a> (I have repeatedly been stonewalled when <a href="" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a>) or <a href="" title="WP:OR">WP:OR</a> when trying to dismiss GAO87 as per <a href="" title="WP:MEDRS">WP:MEDRS</a> and <a href="" title="WP:RS">WP:RS</a>. But lets have a look at <a href="" title="WP:WEIGHT">WP:WEIGHT</a>: It deals with both &#39;mainstream&#39; articles and &#39;minority views&#39;, it notes that fair account of RS material must be given and that the mainstream view should be represented NPOV, that articles on minority view feature descriptions of the minority view (often at length), that mainstream should be represented to counter minority views and that: Other minority views may require much more extensive description of the majority view in order not to mislead the reader. No where does it say that minority views should be pared down.  </dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>&#60;blockquote&#62;
Neutrality requires that the article should fairly represent all significant viewpoints that have been published by a reliable source, and should do so in proportion to the prominence of each.

<dl>
<dd>So is this what orangemarlin meant? if so how? did OM mean that the quote did not represent a significant viewpoint? that GAO87 is not reliable? or that the viewpoint is overrepresented?  I could go on for every line but I am sure you can agree that it would be pointless, especially in light of the fact that OM could just have used 2 minutes to point to which line(s) they thought applied here, quite frankly the supposition that OM is final arbiter or infallible is patently false. Again, I ask you to answer the 2 questions I initially posed here. But just for clarification: The material I seek to add does not reflect the &#39;minority view&#39; according to GAO87 it reflects the position of the 1975 FDA taskforce as well as the most recent polling of researchers working with aspartame, it tries to document just how the controversy came to be in the first place, and reflects correctly and with a NPOV that GAO87 acknowledges that there was a &#39;controversy&#39;. </dd>

<p>After a huge batch of articles on Swedish politicians were created the other day, I looked at <a href="" title="Category:Articles needing translation from Swedish Wikipedia">Category:Articles needing translation from Swedish Wikipedia</a> and some of the other categories in this category &#34;tree&#34;. And honestly, I don&#39;t see the usefulness of most of these pages that contain little more than a translation request. I think the English Wikipedia would be better off with these pages deleted. They pose as articles when linked (as they are <a href="" title="blue">blue</a>) but they contain nothing to build on. The same user who started the Swedish politician articles is now mass-producing equally pointless one-liners on Lithuanian painters. He has also made a <a href="" title="List of Lithuanian painters">List of Lithuanian painters</a> ― which in itself is fine ― except that there is no way to tell from that list whether the article looks like <a href="" title="Vytautas Kazimieras Jonynas">Vytautas Kazimieras Jonynas</a>, a substantial 6,536 byte article, or like <a href="" title="Vilmantas Marcinkevičius">Vilmantas Marcinkevičius</a>, where the entire article text is &#34;Vilmantas Marcinkevičius (born 1969) is a Lithuanian painter.&#34; I am guessing that, in a short while, every name here will be blue, despite the fact that there really won&#39;t be any articles on the majority of these people. (This user is, by the way, not the only one creating these articles, just the most prolific one.)</p> 
<p>Even whatever little content these pages have may be wrong, as with Swedish politicians <a href="" title="Ola Alterå">Ola Alterå</a> or <a href="" title="Gunnel Jonäng">Gunnel Jonäng</a>, which don&#39;t even get the sex of the subjects right. And the Swedish articles they link to and request translations from are often very short, completely unreferenced and may get things seriously wrong in their turn. (the Gunnel Jonäng article in Swedish claims that she was a member from 1969 until 1988 of the Second Chamber of the Riksdag – which was abolished through a parliamentary reform in 1971!).</p>
<p>What is wrong with waiting for people who are willing to spend the time researching and writing on these topics using good sources (not some other Wikipedia)? People who, at the very least, know the relevant language?</p>
<p>In another case, <a href="" title="Nils Lorens Sjöberg">Nils Lorens Sjöberg</a>, the Swedish article from which the reader is urged to translate is based on a biography in a book published in 1906. If that really is the best available source ― I doubt it, but finding better sources may take some effort, like (gasp!) visiting a good library ― the request should at least be to translate from the original source, not via the intermediary of the Swedish Wikipedia article, which may have gotten various things wrong.</p>
<p>Even in those cases where the foreign Wikipedia articles are good and worth translating, I think it would be better if people could just wait for someone who makes a real effort to actually write an article, rather than trying to capture whatever little glory and pleasure there may be in &#34;starting&#34; one while leaving all the work to others. </p>
<p>So where is this going to lead? A situation where the English Wikipedia has &#34;articles&#34; on every conceivable topic in the world, but most of them are a single line long and get half of the few facts in that line wrong because they are written by people who have no idea what they are doing? is this good? --<a href="" title="User:Hegvald">Hegvald</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hegvald">talk</a>) 18:21, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I couldn&#39;t agree more! <a href="" title="Niccolò Machiavelli">Niccolò Machiavelli</a> &#34;needs&#34; expansion from both the Italian and Portuguese WPs (ok, Blofeld has just removed the Portuguese one, but there will be other cases), which do have longer articles, but mostly using sources in their own languages. So it has two huge template banners taking up half the first article screen. At the very least these bloated banners should be drasticxally reduced in size, and moved to the talk page. Any one who actually speaks these languages is pretty sure to know that local articles, like <a href="" title="SP-103">SP-103</a> and dozens of other Brazilian highways, are likely to be much fuller in the local language. <a href="" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Johnbod">talk</a>) 18:33, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>It is an issue - if these were inconspicuous things on talk pages it would not matter so much, but important articles like Machiavelli should not be disfigured in this way.

<dd>Actually Izbo that is part of the idea of the tags. They are not attractive I agree. Wanting to remove the ugly tag, the editor may consider expanding it a bit before removing it as he will have a desire to get rid of it. <a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 21:10, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Once again I CAN&#39;T BELIEVE how shallow minded you guys are here. <a href="" title="Vilmantas Marcinkevičius">Vilmantas Marcinkevičius</a> as you mentioned above was expanded in two minutes flat. I admit it is aonly best to apply tags where there is a lot of content on the other wikipedia, I perahps shouldn&#39;t have started those Brazilian roads yet but certianly there is a massive amount of material to translate and these articles should be started. <a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 19:34, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

<p>The idea is that eventually every articles on a Lithuanian painter is expande dlike <a href="" title="Vytautas Kazimieras Jonynas">Vytautas Kazimieras Jonynas</a> etc. Actually you;d be surprised how many speak various languages on here, there are hundreds of Portuguese speakers on here. <a href="" title="America, Brazil">America, Brazil</a> was expanded from a stub from Portuguese using this silly template that you think of it.

<ul>
<li>- and without the template you would never have known?  As Hegwald says, there are hundreds of thousands of articles that need expansion, but do the tags really aid this. Any English-speaking editor can easily expand Machiavelli from a plethora of on-line English sources, which will give a better end result than an article using unseen foreign references most can never access. Would you object to them being on the talk page? <a href="" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Johnbod">talk</a>) 19:53, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl>

<p>The proof that adding such tags works <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hohenasperg&#38;diff=272732113&#38;oldid=271984998" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hohenasperg&#38;diff=272732113&#38;oldid=271984998">see here</a></p>
<p>Adding it in talk pages would not work. Editors visiting an article with a lack of content visit an aritcle see it is pretty poor and move on. On the otherhand they visit a short articles and may speak the language, remember the huge traffic wikipedia gets and they ar einstantly brught to the attention that the article can instantly be translated form information that already exists in the link and they think, oh I can add a little no problem. A number of our articles have already been expanded in this way. We now have 5 full articles on Croatian architects now thanks to me initial creation by a native Croatian wikipedia. Give time this will be a major benefit to the content of english wikipedia, undoubtedly. If the majority of our users want wikipedia to grow and to read better articles we will make it happen in collaboration. Look how far we&#39;ve come to date. Given that the articles I start are ALWAYS on notable encyclopedic topics there should be no problem in towards working towards building them. <a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 19:57, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

I am passionate about this project, I would like to see articles on topics in such encyclopedias as on the right, and I know the creator of wikipedia also thinks so. Each of the articles atrted early have resourceful articles in this book. I&#39;m doing the best I can to try to do the best I can in the long term to build content on here. Creating the actual article however shoddy is still a move towards achieving our goals on here. Of course i want full super articles like everybody, just let things evolve. There should be enough people who use this site and want to improve it to make things happen like this.</p>
<p>What I do is compared categories in ENglish with other wikipedias and root out the missing articles.
Why shouldn&#39;t I feel free to work towards for instance expanding our coverage of <a href="" title="Category:Castles in Estonia">Category:Castles in Estonia</a> using <a class="externallink" href="http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategooria:Eesti_linnused" rel="nofollow" title="http://et.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kategooria:Eesti_linnused">this</a>.

<dd>I think that commenters here are not making the necessary distinctions between different applications of these tags. Adding one to Machiavelli, I agree, is pretty silly, but it is perfectly reasonable to add them to stubs about Lithuanian painters. If the topic is extremely obscure and barely anyone looks for it, this should not be a reason to fret that it&#39;s making Wikipedia somehow look bad. Having stubs does not somehow detract from the rest of our better articles. I doubt there are many English-language sources about <a href="" title="Ona Danutė Buivydaitė">Ona Danutė Buivydaitė</a> (only 75 ghits anyways), who nonetheless has an entry in the <a href="" title="Universal Lithuanian Encyclopedia">only existing Lithuanian encyclopeida</a>. It is much easier to translate these articles than to attempt to research them from scratch. How many editors outside Lithuania have access to this encyclopedia? Probably not many. For non-Lithuanian speakers, this article nonetheless links to a machine translation that can be helpful in understanding the subject of the article: <a class="externallink" href="http://translate.google.com/translate?&#38;u=http%3A%2F%2Flt.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOna+Danut%C4%97+Buivydait%C4%97&#38;sl=lt&#38;tl=en" rel="nofollow" title="http://translate.google.com/translate?&#38;u=http%3A%2F%2Flt.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOna+Danut%C4%97+Buivydait%C4%97&#38;sl=lt&#38;tl=en"><a class="externallink" href="http://translate.google.com/translate?&#38;u=http%3A%2F%2Flt.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOna+Danut%C4%97+Buivydait%C4%97&#38;sl=lt&#38;tl=en" rel="nofollow" title="http://translate.google.com/translate?&#38;u=http%3A%2F%2Flt.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOna+Danut%C4%97+Buivydait%C4%97&#38;sl=lt&#38;tl=en">http://translate.google.com/translate?&#38;u=http%3A%2F%2Flt.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FOna+Danut%C4%97+Buivydait%C4%97&#38;sl=lt&#38;tl=en</a></a> gives me a decent idea of what this guy does.

A talk page template would not do this. Talk page templates also tend to get stale, because they are never removed from articles that no longer need translation. When I cleaned out old translation requests, probably a majority of &#34;requests&#34; had already been dealt with, but the tag remained. This makes it harder for editors to look for translations that actually need doing. (And in any event, this template can be moved to talk pages if you want to - it automatically changes its style to match other talk page templates.) It is hard to reduce the size of the template, because it is necessary to retain the GFDL warning. Otherwise no one would appropriately credit sources. <a href="" title="User:Calliopejen1">Calliopejen1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Calliopejen1">talk</a>) 20:36, 11 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Yes I tagged Machiavelli not really thinking when I was going through Portuguese featured articles most of which we could benefit from. The translation is particular good when articles are referenced on other wikipedias of which we are missing thousands from especially German and Dutch wiki. Such articles are only &#34;extremely obscure&#34; because of the pre-conceived bias that exists towards such places. Why would an artist who has works in the national museum be &#34;extremely obscure&#34;? Would an article on an American artist who has works in a museum in Philadelphia for instance by considered &#34;extrmeely obscure&#34;? If you see the world from a differen viewpoint and nationality you would think very diffently in regarding it as an obscure topic. Wikipedia is very much a process of globalisation and the spreading of knowledge, I think it does provide us with an opportunity to open up these &#34;obscure&#34; topics and make them knwoledge to anybody in the English world. Obviously the reality is that the articles will not get as much traffic as American pop stars for instance but it is still part of the development process on here. They are tradiationally encyclopedic articles, just covering them in more detail by intergrating national encyclopedias. <a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 20:40, 11 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Yes, an article on an American artist who has works in a museum in Philadelphia for instance would (perhaps) be considered &#34;extremely obscure&#34;? We have hundreds of crap stubs on English and American artists which at the current rate of improvement will stay that way for many years, and many missing articles.  There is no point on uglifying what we have with &#34;expand&#34; templates - people can see what they are like, they can see from the iw panel what other articles there are, and if they want to do anything out it they can. I have seen some of the half-translated Lithuanian articles, &#38; if that is the end result of these tags (obviously in fact done by someone starting from the Lithuanian end not the English one) I would say its not worth it. <a href="" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Johnbod">talk</a>) 23:13, 11 March 2009 (UTC)   </dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>&#34;&#34;X is a Lithuanian painter&#34; is a valid stub.&#34;? No, this is a candidate for A7 deletion. Being a painter is not an assertion of importance. As I said elsewhere, creating unsourced stubs is settign a bad example for all other editors, since we urge people to create <i>sourced</i> articles. CReating unsourced <a href="" title="WP:BLP">BLPs</a> based on unsourced Wikipedia articles in other langauges is soemthing which should be discouraged, since we are importing the good things from elsewhere together with the rubbish from elsewhere (hoaxes, vanity and spam articles, spelling errors in names, ...). I am all for creating articles based on existing articles in other languages, <i>if the content is checked and the article here has at least one source</i>. The method used by Blofeld is all about quantity and ignores all quality standards, and should be discouraged.

<dl>
<dd>To me, these templates serve a useful purpose not only in identifying content which can be happily expanded from Wikipedia, but in going a step further than the translation request system we&#39;ve had in place for so long.  I tried the old system once before - as I recall it took something like a year and change before the article I requested was translated from German.  That would be fine if there weren&#39;t that much valid content which could be transferred.  Trouble is, there&#39;s a <i>lot</i> of it.  I remember once wandering into the French Wikipedia and trying to compile a list of articles which merited translation; I got through about two pages&#39; worth before I threw up my hands in despair.  If Wikipedia is to be a true repository of all the world&#39;s information, then these articles <i>must</i> be identified and translated somehow.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>These templates are great because, as others have noted, they&#39;re in-your-face.  With a little link on a translation project subpage, it&#39;s easy for interested parties to overlook things.  With these templates, it becomes much harder.  And translation is a <i>great</i> way to get people involved in generating content.  And the more we get people involved in generating content, the better off the project will be.  Is it perfect?  No.  But then, what system is?  And this one goes farther towards achieving our goal than any other method I can think of.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>I used to be anti-stub creation myself, honestly; I felt that <i>if</i> I was going to create something, it was going to need to be substantial to be worthwhile.  What I&#39;ve found, though, is that as often as not, people are discouraged when they don&#39;t see <i>anything</i> about a subject on Wikipedia.  Having <i>something</i>, however small, often serves as an encouragement for expansion.  Which is the most important thing, in the end, to me.</dd></dl>

<dd>Yes, I would object if you created anymore unchecked or badly checked semi-automated translations. Yesterday, you created <a href="" title="Kęstutis Balčikonis">Kęstutis Balčikonis</a>, an article on a Lithuanian painter from 1949, based on the Lithuanian Wikipedia, but with a reference added to the Universal Lithuanian Encyclopedia. However, this article can hardly be based on that Encyclopedia, since the info is wrong. The Kęstutis Balčikonis you are interwikilinking to, and for whom you copied the birthdate from the Lith Wikipedia, is <i>not</i> the Kęstutis Balčikonis who is a painter. The 1949 Kęstutis Balčikonis is a politician, which you have now nicely mixed up with the 1952 painter of the same name <a href="http://lt.wikipedia.org/wiki/K%C4%99stutis_Bal%C4%8Dikonis_(1952)">lt:Kęstutis Balčikonis (1952)</a>, an article which does have a ref from the ULE. </dd>

<p>Now for my more general reply: You are trying to make this into an issue of fighting against <a href="" title="systemic bias">systemic bias</a>, with you as the good guy trying to expand the anglocentric English Wikipedia, and me and others as the people who defend the status quo. As I said above, this is a <a href="" title="strawman argument">strawman argument</a>. This is not what this is about. I can probably say that every article I have written so far, and every article I am working on off-line, is in some way a counterweight to the current systemic bias, even those on anglophone topics. (The systemic bias in the English wikipedia is not only anglocentric and US-centric, but youth-centric, pop culture-centric and recent-centric -- not sure if there are proper terms for these things).</p>
<p>What I question is this <i>method</i> for countering systemic bias. I don&#39;t disagree that every topic in the <a href="" title="Universal Lithuanian Encyclopedia">Universal Lithuanian Encyclopedia</a> should have an article here eventually. I do disagree with your approach of starting an article on every topic, even when you don&#39;t know the language or properly understand the historical or cultural context. I am just assuming that you understand even less Lithuanian than Swedish, correct me if I&#39;m wrong. And, obviously, I have nothing against the many substantial translations that you make from Romance languages with which you are apparently familiar. </p>
<p>Further, I disagree with these banners requesting translations of foreign-Wikipedia articles <i>en masse</i>, with no consideration of the quality of the original. Many of these articles are not worth translating, not because the inherent worth of the subject but <i>because the articles are bad</i>. Badly written and unreferenced articles on the Swedish Wikipedia need to be rewritten from scratch there. Here, I think they should either be written from scratch from good (mostly Swedish) sources or translated whenever the Swedish article is clearly worth translating.</p>
<p>This translation umbrella project would be far better off working with native speakers (or other people who know the languages and cultures involved) to identify the articles in various other wikipedias that are actually good and worth translating, and try to channel efforts towards those specific articles. That includes the equivalents of featured articles and some others. In many other cases, translations are only going to propagate basic errors or waste people&#39;s time. (It&#39;s one thing if people <i>want</i> to waste their own time translating crappy articles, but the English Wikipedia should not use its collective voice to urge them to do so.)</p>
<p>Finally, I disagree with mass-producing articles that will eventually leave no red links in some areas, even if the articles produced are unsatisfactory. Personally I think <a href="" title="red links">red links</a> in otherwise decent articles are enticing. I think such links are likely to eventually get someone interested in the topic to start a new, good article. When I wrote <a href="" title="Kahn Lectures">Kahn Lectures</a>, I intentionally left <a href="" title="Charles Rufus Morey">Charles Rufus Morey</a> as a red link, despite the fact that I could easily have written a two-line (or even slightly longer) article on the topic (there are pretty good sources on Morey on the web). I am hoping some art historian or art history buff who is familiar with Morey and his work will be attracted by the opportunity and write a better article on him from the start than I would have been interested in doing. Personally I am collecting material for an expansion of <a href="" title="Johnny Roosval">Johnny Roosval</a> and for other articles on Swedish art historians, as I know few English-speakers (and pretty few Swedish-speaking wikipedists, for that matter) are going to be able to make competent contributions in that field.</p>
<p>Your approach, as I see it, leads to people not being enticed to write something substantial on a topic in which they are personally interested, but to be <i>provoked</i> to correct something on a topic with which they are only vaguely familiar ― but know more about than the original author, perhaps ― because the entry looks so bad that it <i>just can&#39;t stand</i>. I don&#39;t think it puts people in the right frame of mind to treat article expansion or improvement as emergency damage control. --<a href="" title="User:Hegvald">Hegvald</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hegvald">talk</a>) 09:07, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dl>
<dd>Sorry I disagree completely with the notion that a red link encourages people to write a good article etc etc. Exactly as Jen said above you are painting every single articles on another wikipedia in the same light. It is extremely narrow-minded of you to suggest that articles on other wikipedias are ALL badly written when there is actually a mass of excellent content that exists. People in other languages can produce satisfaxctory content as much as anybody on english wikipedia, the difference is often the standard for what is an FA i slower, not because the writers can&#39;t produce well referenced or good content. There are thousands of articles on German wikipedia alone that put many of our articles on here to shame, even on core topics in which ours should be WAY better given the greater number who use it. I&#39;ll agree that many of the Swedish politicians on swedish wiki are not of a satisfactory level as many other articles are on other wikis, perhaps it would be best to avoid transwikying stubs or articles which are potentially inaccurate etc until they can be written properly. I&#39;m certian though you are no aware of the thousands of excellent articles there are on other wikis. Sure a lot of them are badly written and not suitable for transwikying. WHat you are misunderstanding is that creating the articles or initial brief translation is intended as a start, reliable strong sources and writing is intended to come later by anybody interested and understands the topic better than I do. Given the massive reach of wikipedia and the considerable success I&#39;ve had to date with people who know about the subjects expanding the poor stubs I have created I don&#39;t see why it is a bad thing. If somebody knowledge came across one of the swedish politician articles and though mm the articles is really BAD on swedish wiki too, why it is out of the question that they write the article itself and then remove the tag. The tags are only intended as a link to what already exists on the topic and provide suggestions. If you think I don&#39;t want the final result to be several hundred well written and well referenced articles then you are sorely mistaken. The articles actually have to be created initially to work towards achieving our project goal as Albert said above. You cannot ignore 90% of the notable politicians in Sweden, the huge indifference in coverage is not a good thing either and we must work towards providing a fuller coverage whether the articles begin as sub stubs or more editors care about American pop culture or not. Its just your cynical attitude and shallow mindedness towards EVERY article on other wikipedias and indeed disrespect for what I am capable of that I find concerning. </dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>What I find quite amazing is that you&#39;ve also created poor quality stubs like <a href="" title="Södra Råda Old Church">Södra Råda Old Church</a> yourself, when the Swedish equivalent is actually a lot better than it. You also could learn some lessons in how to reference articles and not list a bunch of scruffy url links in which you cannot decipher what is sourced to what. I bet there are thousands of articles in Swedish alone which are far better than the english equivalent. <a class="externallink" href="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkitektur_i_Stockholm" rel="nofollow" title="http://sv.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arkitektur_i_Stockholm">This</a> is exactly what I&#39;m talking about. These articles &#34;should&#34; be put into english, no doubts. I have therefore created a stub at <a href="" title="Architecture in Stockholm">Architecture in Stockholm</a> in which in due course am convinced that it will translated and develop into a good article. Perhaps I should have waited until the whole article has been written before I started it? And its not even the better articles than can be traswikikied. <a href="" title="Tynningö">Tynningö</a> would obviously benefit from translation from Swedish wikipedia as would thousands of other articles and finding some online citations to support it. <a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 09:51, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<dd>OK, first of all, I&#39;ll admit that <a href="" title="Södra Råda Old Church">Södra Råda Old Church</a> is not good, but it was my first article and I have been meaning to expand it for quite some time. A significant part of the reason I gave up on it originally was the lack of available freely-licensed images that appeared unsurmountable at the time - the church was famous for its paintings but burnt down through arson a few years ago. The Swedish article has been improved since I originally wrote the one here, and images have been uploaded  to Commons by a Swedish user only in recent months. (Get back to it on the 31st of March, and I promise that it will look far better, perhaps on the way to become a featured article.)

<dd>Second, you continue to construct strawman aruments to a degree where I have to question whether a debate is meaningful. I wrote above:</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<dd>
<dl>
<dd><i>This translation umbrella project would be far better off working with native speakers (or other people who know the languages and cultures involved) to identify the articles in various other wikipedias that are actually good and worth translating, and try to channel efforts towards those specific articles. That includes the equivalents of featured articles and some others. In many other cases, translations are only going to propagate basic errors or waste people&#39;s time. (It&#39;s one thing if people want to waste their own time translating crappy articles, but the English Wikipedia should not use its collective voice to urge them to do so.)</i></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Now, could you please tell me where I expressed the opinion that &#34;all&#34; the content on other wikipedias is bad or where I deny that &#34;[p]eople in other languages can produce satisfaxctory content as much as anybody on english wikipedia&#34;. If I thought so, I would hardly suggest that the translation project make an effort to identify the articles worth translating, would I? Many articles on <i>any</i> Wikipedia, including this one, are bad. And the average quality on the German Wikipedia is higher partly because they have higher quality requirements. I don&#39;t think they would accept many of your one-line entries. But I will leave to someone who knows more about the German Wikipedia to comment on that.</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The point is to be discerning and not indiscriminately suggest translations from articles which are bad, and the fact is that the articles which you have produced have both contained very basic factual errors and suggested translations from Swedish articles which are unreferenced and contain perhaps more subtle errors. (Any Swedish-speaker will recognize the sex of someone called Ola or Gunnel. That the two-chamber parliament was replaced in 1971 is a basic fact of history but may still not be obvious to everyone who wants to exercise their translation skills.) --<a href="" title="User:Hegvald">Hegvald</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Hegvald">talk</a>) 10:18, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>Sorry but your argument about initial errors or mistakes is not a strong one. The articles are on notable subjects and should be started preferably without any mistakes but any obvious mistakes will be corrected given time. User:Tomas e has expanded a few of the Swedish politicians already and he is a native speaker. Similarly other Swedish wikipedians on here will be able to spot mistakes and correct them within an instant of visiting the article. This is a wiki, articles can change dramatically within seconds of anybody knoweldgeable about the subject to expand it. Minor errors on sub stubs are not sufficient grounds not to start the article articles on a notable subject. <a href="" title="Carlos Solórzano">Carlos Solórzano</a> was a crappy stub I started yesterday. Within minutes it was expanded just now using reliable sources. Editors on here are intelligent enough to know whether the article on the other wikipedia is good enough or not and to select sources.<a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 12:21, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>



<dl>
<dd>This all makes for interesting reading!  Adding my 2 cents: I&#39;d recommend you do create a stub for <a href="" title="Charles Rufus Morey">Charles Rufus Morey</a>.  Lots of people seem unwilling or unaware of <i>how</i> to start an article, and are happy to edit away if the article exists in the first place.  I found this out when I first started editing WP and there were plenty of holes in the filmography of <a href="" title="Ingmar Bergman">Ingmar Bergman</a>, for example (and a Swedish example too, which seems apt!)  I think the expanision banner is way too large, but that&#39;s for another discussion at another time.

<p>Re the assertion that only the best foreign-language articles should be tagged, to channel our work there: Have you ever tried translating a foreign-language FA? It is a LOT of work. Most people will not have the time or inclination to translate such an article. But a casual user might have the ability to translate a short, several-paragraph article. I think we will see more benefits from tagging such articles than from taggging FAs. <a href="" title="User:Calliopejen1">Calliopejen1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Calliopejen1">talk</a>) 12:11, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>See, here&#39;s the nub of the issue.  I&#39;m not sure I agree with you, Hegvald; honestly, I think for a lot of newbies red links are a little frightening.  Having a stub, however small, gives them something to sink their teeth into; once they&#39;ve done a few of those, perhaps they&#39;ll move on to looking at red links and working on them.  But seeing that massive amount of blank space, and plunging in with no idea of how to begin (the way most people do, after all) is a daunting task to many new editors.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>I think Lugnuts has hit the crux of the matter on the head; it&#39;s not so much that people are <i>unaware</i> of how to start an article as they are <i>unwilling</i>.  Tons of questions come to mind - will the subject be encyclopedic?  Is this worth doing?  Where are the best sources to use?  How do I learn syntax?  Why am I even bothering?  At least having a small stub to work off of is helpful, and I think eases people into the project quite nicely. --<a href="" title="User:AlbertHerring">User:AlbertHerring</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User_talk:AlbertHerring">Io son l&#39;orecchio e tu la bocca: parla!</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 13:36, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Also, as we have seen (see my diffs posted above) there are some IPs who do translation. Registering may be a barrier that keeps people from contributing. This way were can allow IPs to do translation. If English is not your first language, you might not be likely to create an account on en.wiki, but many ESL contributors could do perfectly serviceable translations. For instance, I help out occasionally on fr.wiki but I don&#39;t have an account there. If I were stopped from creating an article and asked to register, I&#39;d probably think <i>Why bother</i> and move on. <a href="" title="User:Calliopejen1">Calliopejen1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Calliopejen1">talk</a>) 14:44, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>Funnily enough Hegwald was happy to carry on complaining here and saying how Charles Rufus Morey was a missing article but I notice he didn&#39;t even bother to make a start on it. While he bitches about stubs on here, I&#39;m actually making links happen by creating <a href="" title="Charles Rufus Morey">Charles Rufus Morey</a> and writing the articles and expanding other sub stubs I created like <a href="" title="Carlos Solórzano">Carlos Solórzano</a>. He could be translating the <a href="" title="Architecture in Stockholm">Architecture in Stockholm</a> articles instead of complaining. I&#39;m not the sort of guy who likes to sit back and dwell on things, I&#39;m the sort of guy who wants to see results, if you want to see results you have to get off your arse and start working towards a goal. My goal eventually is to see a number of good articles on here in English that are on other wikipedias, but believe what you like. In order to make this happen I need contributors to help me. <a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 13:45, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p>I just translated <a href="" title="Virgilio Rodríguez Macal">Virgilio Rodríguez Macal</a> which is an unreferenced articles on Spanish wikipedia.

<dl>
<dd>I think you are missing my point completely. I did not &#34;complain&#34; about Morey not having an article. Had I found the situation intolerable, I could have started the article myself. On the contrary, I pointed out how this red link could be what may lure a new user to start contributing. And once I had mentioned it above, I sort-of expected you to start the article... ;-) Well done!</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>OK, maybe you and Albert and Lugnuts are right and new users are hesitant to start new articles. I don&#39;t quite understand that; it seems people are coming here and starting new articles all the time. But maybe it&#39;s true. I still think you should slow down a bit and focus more on the articles you can expand yourself.</dd></dl>


<dl>
<dd>I agree that <a href="" title="Architecture in Stockholm">Architecture in Stockholm</a> is one of the articles worth translating, but I am not going to do it, not in the immediate future anyway. I can, however, tell you that I am going to post substantial articles in the English Wikipedia on quite a few of the topics linked from <a href="" title="sv:Arkitektur i Stockholm">sv:Arkitektur i Stockholm</a> and presumably from the English article whenever it gets finished.

<p>I will try to add at least something to the new stubs I create in future, rather than ... is a .. painter. End of. As I said I was focusing more on the task of blue linking the red links rather than concentrating on the individual articles. IN the case of Swedish politicians particularly living I will see if I can include a link to a page on the government site or source in which anybody visiting it can use material on swedish wiki or seek out better sources. Anyway I&#39;ve expanded around 15 of the stubs I created today, just wish I hadad the time to write everyone up to a decent standard. If I can create a stub with a sentence or two saying what they did etc this would be a better start but I need to still operate relatively quickly as there is so much to transwiki, so little time. <a href="" title="User:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;span style=&#34;border:1px solid blue;padding:1px;&#34;&#62; &#60;font style=&#34;color:#fef;background:black;&#34;&#62;<b><i>Dr. Blofeld</i></b>&#60;/font&#62;</a>&#60;/span&#62;     &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Dr. Blofeld">&#60;font size=&#34;-4&#34;&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;Black&#34;&#62;White cat&#60;/font&#62;&#60;/font color&#62;</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 17:46, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Cooperate, not conflict</dd></dl>

<p>There are quite a few editors and &#39;bots who massively do things that annoy me; in fact, not only annoy but create a hindrance to my work (in my opinion). Some time ago I used to complain. Now I became wiser. In a nutshell: if an editor is in good standing, i.e., not an obvious vandal or hoaxer (or novice who misunderstands something), he has rights to do what he thinks is good for wikipedia. There are life long conflicts of polarized views in wikipedia: inclusionists vs deletionists, perfectionists vs quickwriters, etc., where both sides are both right and wrong. Well, this black-wtite struggle is as old as the civilization.</p>
<p>A proper solution is not to seek how to bar a good man from doing what he is doing, but to find a reasonable trade-off for mutual benefit. In this particular case, I would suggest the editor to create only referenced stubs. Or, if the original foreing wikipedia has no references, then to make some google check to make sure that the subject <b>may be</b> (not &#34;is&#34;) notable &#38; add a tag  . I agree that the tags which larger than stubs are ugly, but in opinions of some people (at least me), stubs in obscure areas are just as important as FAs (or even more: after all, people can read about <a href="" title="George Bush">George Bush</a> elsewhere). - 7-bubёn <a href="" title="user talk:SemBubenny">&#62;t</a> 16:51, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</p>
<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="So.2C_how_does_one_decide_whether_to_label_a_person.3F">So, how does one decide whether to label a person?</span></h2>

<p>Hello. I wasn&#39;t sure where to put this. I&#39;d almost wondered if it belonged on the BLP noticeboard, but this is more of a <i>question</i>, rather than a dispute.
&#60;br/&#62;I was looking at the <a href="" title="Lindsay Lohan">Lindsay Lohan</a> article, and there&#39;s a (very quick) <a href="#Seriously.3F" title="Talk:Lindsay_Lohan">discussion</a> on the talk page about whether or not the <a href="" title="Category:LGBT_people_from_the_United_States">LBGT americans</a> category should be in her article (currently, it&#39;s there).
&#60;br/&#62;I&#39;d started talking about it on the talk page, but already wasn&#39;t certain either way. After reading more pages here, I&#39;m even more confused, so I thought this&#39;d be the best place for opinions about how categories should be applied.
&#60;br/&#62;There are arguments <i>for</i> and <i>against</i> including the tag.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Just about everyone (at least everyone with a weakness for reading celebrity drivel) knows that she&#39;s had a girlfriend for quite some time now.</li>
<li>According to the article, when asked if she was bisexual, she said, &#34;Maybe. Yeah.&#34;</li>
<li>However, self-identity seems to play at least <i>some</i> role in several articles (the discussion linked above explains this a bit better), and she immediately followed that comment with, &#34;I don&#39;t want to classify myself.&#34;</li>
<li>Any statement where she implies that she&#39;s bisexual, <i>but</i> includes the word &#34;maybe&#34; doesn&#39;t really sound very... decisive?</li>
<li>The <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Categorization">Wikipedia:Categorization</a> page explicitly states that, &#34;Categories are for defining characteristics...&#34; and she&#39;s (as mentioned) explicitly stated that she doesn&#39;t wish to classify herself. So... if she explicitly doesn&#39;t classify as LBGT, it&#39;s hard to argue that that element is a &#34;defining characteristic&#34; of her, isn&#39;t it?</li></ul>
<p>Anyways, as the article&#39;s semi-protected, I have no ability to change it either way(even if I <i>was</i> sure of the answer). I was just interested in a broader source of opinions on when these sorts of categories should be applied. <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/209.90.135.202">209.90.135.202</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:209.90.135.202">talk</a>) 03:24, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Proposal_for_introduction_of_NC_licensed_photos_on_Wikipedia">Proposal for introduction of NC licensed photos on Wikipedia</span></h2>

<p>Several editors have proposed reopening the discussion of <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Non-free content">Wikipedia policy on use of non-commercial licensed images</a> (for example, images licensed <a class="externallink" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/" rel="nofollow" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/us/">CC-NC</a>). The following discussion is being transferred from <a href="#Non_commercial_image_license" title="Wikipedia talk:Featured picture candidates/Archive_20">Wikipedia talk:Featured picture candidates/Archive_20</a>. The discussion there began with photographers who would prefer to license their contributions to WP as non-commercial , but expanded to the use of existing archival and (for example) <a href="" title="Flickr">Flickr</a> NC-licensed images. This discussion attracted interest from such WP notables as <a href="" title="Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> and <a href="" title="Erik Möller">Erik Möller</a>.  Opinions discussed range from allowing all NC content, to allowing some NC content as a limited replacement for fair use, to continuing the existing ban on all NC content.</p>
<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Impetus">Impetus</span></h3>
<p>Having recently invested quite a lot in photographic gear, I am reluctant to give away my images for free. I have no problem with wikipedia or any other non-commercial organization using them, however I would not like commercial institutions to benefit at my expense. I therefore suggest wikipedia adopt a non commercial license such as  <a class="externallink" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/" rel="nofollow" title="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/3.0/">CC-NC</a> . This will not violate wikis principles of free knowledge and will convince photographers to release higher resolution pictures as well. It might also convince professional photographers to release their work knowing that their work will not be used for commercial means and that they will still be able to make a living.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if this issue has been discussed before and I know village pump would probably be the place but I wanted some feedback from the photographers before taking it there. --<a href="" title="User:Muhammad Mahdi Karim"><b>Muhammad</b></a><a href="" title="User Talk:Muhammad Mahdi Karim">&#60;small&#62;(<i>talk</i>)&#60;/small&#62;</a> 05:16, 5 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Practical_Considerations">Practical Considerations</span></h3>
<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Potential_to_tap_into_new_useful_content">Potential to tap into new useful content</span></h4>
<p>It has been suggested (Fir0002, Diliff and others) that semi-professional grade photographers are put off by the potential of their works being exploited commercially. These photographers my contribute their images to Wikipedia if it had an option of NC licensing.
</p>
<ul>
<li>I think that providing photographers with this kind of basic protection and choice in how their images get used will strongly benefit the project (and by the project I mean a free online encyclopedia) with semi-pro grade photography. --<a href="" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 01:40, 8 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>As Fir0002 said, allowing NC (with an allowance for Wikipedia&#39;s commercial use in financial emergencies) licenses would encourage better photography, and would not compromise the encylopaedia in any way, as long as distribution was limited to Wikipedia. <a href="" title="User:Diliff">Diliff</a>   &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User talk:Diliff">(Talk)</a>   <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Diliff">(Contribs)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 10:50, 9 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>It was further suggested (Pete Tillman, Muhammad Mahdi Karim) that there already exists large amounts of untapped NC content on flickr and other sources.
</p>
<ul>
<li>There are a number of historic archives that license their photographs for free noncommercial reuse under the CC-NC licenses -- a good example is the large <a class="externallink" href="http://unitproj.library.ucla.edu/dlib/lat/introduction.cfm" rel="nofollow" title="http://unitproj.library.ucla.edu/dlib/lat/introduction.cfm">LA Times photo archive at UCLA</a>. And many photographers at Flickr license their photos as CC-NC. We&#39;re missing out on a lot of good, free content by not allowing CC-NC licensed material at Wikipedia.

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Integration_of_NC_images_with_GFDL_text_in_articles">Integration of NC images with GFDL text in articles</span></h4>
<p>It has been suggested (Dragons Flight, Fletcher and others) that NC images would conflict with the GFDL text and make it impossible for them to coexist in an article.
</p>
<ul>
<li>You can only create that combined work if the licenses and associated rights on all the pieces allow you to do so.  The FSF position, and I would argue the natural reading of the license, is that creating that new article version is only allowed if all the pre-existing pieces are licensed under the GFDL.  <a href="" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dragons flight">talk</a>) 00:25, 9 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>In response it was suggested (Fir0002) that the fact Wikipedia articles already contain a variety of individual licenses (from PD to FU) there shouldn&#39;t be any issues with incorporating NC
<ul>
<li>If a GFDL article can host a Fair Use image then a GFDL article can host NC images. If a GFDL article can host CC-by-SA content (which is not GFDL) then it can host NC images. If a GFDL article can host PD content (again not GFDL) then it can host NC images. Wikipedia already incorporates many different copyrights into it&#39;s articles - one more is not going to make a whole lot of difference. --<a href="" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 06:06, 9 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Wikipedia_should_be_free_as_in_free_content">Wikipedia should be free as in free content</span></h4>
<p>It has been argued (Fletcher, Kaldari, Eloquence) that Wikipedia is rooted in the free content movement and therefore should be treated as a repository of free content which anyone can use for any purpose (including profit)
</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia is free as in speech, not (just) free as in beer -- free in the sense advocated by Stallman et al, where downstream users may use the content for any purpose. <a href="" title="User:Fletcher">Fletcher</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Fletcher">talk</a>) 15:15, 9 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikipedia is and always has been a <i>free culture</i> project. Its goal is education, yes, but it is also the creation of free content. Content that anyone can use for anything.<a href="" title="User:Calliopejen1">Calliopejen1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Calliopejen1">talk</a>) 23:35, 8 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>Wikipedia has been a free culture project since it&#39;s inception.... &#34;Free license&#34; doesn&#39;t mean free as in &#34;no cost&#34;, it means free as in &#34;free speech&#34;. <a href="" title="User:Kaldari">Kaldari</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Kaldari">talk</a>) 15:26, 9 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Wikipedia.27s_priorities_-_encyclopedia_or_free_content">Wikipedia&#39;s priorities - encyclopedia or free content</span></h4>
<p>Largely in response to the above argument, it was contended (Fir0002, Diliff and others) that Wikipedia is primarily a free (as in no cost) encyclopedia and providing high quality encyclopaedic content should be its priority.</p>

<ul>
<li>It seems like WMF is willing to sacrifice the original primary goal of Wikipedia (which is to create the best and most complete free encyclopaedia to the best of my knowledge) in order to stick to the (IMO misguided) ideology of free content for all, regardless of purpose or intent. <a href="" title="User:Diliff">Diliff</a>   &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User talk:Diliff">(Talk)</a>   <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Diliff">(Contribs)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 10:50, 9 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>


<ul>
<li>if Getty or Reuters suddenly approached WMF and said to Wikipedia that we want to donate all of our images under an NC license to support the creation of a free encyclopedia, wouldn&#39;t you want the WMF to accept that offer? Again ultimately I think that question hinges on what Wikipedia&#39;s priorities are - being an encyclopedia or being a free content resource. That&#39;s no longer making Wikipedia the best it could possibly be in terms of making the best freely (no cost) accessible encyclopedia; that&#39;s making Wikipedia as good as it can be subject to a certain ideology. --<a href="" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 12:53, 10 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<h3><span class="mw-headline" id="Prior_discussions_and_present_Wikipedia_policy_for_NC-licensed_content">Prior discussions and present Wikipedia policy for NC-licensed content</span></h3>

<p>Wikipedia&#39;s current policy on material licensed for non-commercial reuse is at <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Non-free content">Wikipedia:Non-free content</a>. NC-licensed material is presently defined as &#34;non-free&#34;.</p>

<li>Two things.  First, although there is still some debate about it in some quarters, in general CC NC licensing is not thought to prevent hosting on a site with advertising.  So it would be possible for Wikipedia to both have NC licensed images and to have advertising.  I oppose both, by the way. :-)  Second, the best way to understand my position on this is to read Erik Moeller&#39;s <a class="externallink" href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/9/11/16331/0655" rel="nofollow" title="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/9/11/16331/0655">essay</a>.--<a href="" title="User:Jimbo Wales">Jimbo Wales</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Jimbo Wales">talk</a>) 20:45, 7 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

|With all respect to the author of the essay it strikes me as having been written from the wrong perspective and hence contains several errors. The key problem as I see it is that he&#39;s assuming contributors <i>want</i> their contributions to spread in numerous derivatives far beyond Wikipedia. I for one dont. I contribute to Wikipedia as I think <i>it</i> is a valuable resource as an encyclopedia <i>only</i>. I&#39;m contributing to increase the informative value of the articles on Wikipedia, <i>not</i> to contribute to a general free content movement.
</p>
<dl>
<dd>Here&#39;s a few counterpoints to his objections:
<dl>
<dd><b>Incompatibility:</b> From what I gather he&#39;s dealing with derivative works in the context of <i>text</i> contributions rather than photos. Text is obviously edited and chopped and changed a lot after it&#39;s created. However, images rarely undergo any major modifications after being created, and when those modifications <i>are</i> made it&#39;s very simple to upload the edit under the same license. Placing that NC image into a GFDL article is not going to cause any issues (just as using fair use images does not cause any issues).</dd>
<dd><b>Basic Uses:</b> As it happens I <i>dont</i> want bloggers and newspapers randomly using my images. If they want to use my image they at least owe me the courtesy of asking - and usually I&#39;ll give permission for it to be used.</dd>
<dd><b>Existing copyright terms:</b> Again yes I do want to maintain my copyright indefinitely</dd>
<dd><b>Profit!:</b> Essentially what he&#39;s arguing is that you may as well upload with a liberal license because you&#39;re gonna be ripped off anyway. But the people who are going to rip you off are not really in &#34;the market&#34; - in other words even if they cared about obeying copyright they wouldn&#39;t pay for an image; instead they would go find a different pic or just not use it at all. Large corporations you&#39;d expect to respect copyright and would pay you in exchange for a less restrictive license. I would much rather have some level of protection and be ripped off by small-timers than none at all and ripped off by everyone. I would at least like to have the <i>option</i> of uploading under an NC license.</dd>
<dd>A big problem with liberal licenses is that people rarely go beyond &#34;you are free to use this commercially&#34; and read SA terms - much less actually comply with these conditions. The &#34;SA license will create useful derivatives under free licenses&#34; is largely, IMO, a myth. People treat these licenses as essentially equivalent to PD - you&#39;re free to do what you want with the image and relicense as you please. At least if you explcitly say this image has rights reserved (ie you can&#39;t use it for a commercial purpose) people will pause and consider the terms before misusing the image.</dd>
<dd>As far as WMF using images commercially to help run the project I don&#39;t think anyone uploading under NC would have any problem with allowing this.</dd>
<dd><b>Conclusion:</b> I would disagree that uploading under a free license protects you from large scale exploitation - I think every photographer has a pet story about how they got ripped - a good one would be Diliff and Apple. I think that providing photographers with this kind of basic protection and choice in how thier images get used will strongly benefit the project (and by the project I mean a free online encyclopedia) with semi-pro grade photography. --<a href="" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 01:40, 8 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<ul>
<li>...Many months ago I approached the Foundation about allowing NC images in place of fair use  images for subjects where no truly free image exists.  That is to say that NC might be allowed, but only when there was no more free alternative was available to show the same subject.  Personally, I consider NC to be much clearer for reusers than fair use, since in both cases a commercial reuser may need to remove images, but NC provides a <b><a href="" title="bright line">bright line</a></b> while fair use is fuzzy and ought to be looked at on a case by case basis.  The Foundation was open to the idea of using limited NC images at the time, provided that the community backed it.  Though there would still be a tension between the desire to encourage people to create truly free content and the desire to have any photo at all of a difficult to obtain subject.  <a href="" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dragons flight">talk</a>) 20:31, 9 March 2009 (UTC) </li></ul>


<ul>
<li>It&#39;s been Wikimedia&#39;s long-standing position that allowing commercial re-use contributes to its educational mission (the negative impact of stupid commercial uses is outweighed by the positive impact of educational, commercial uses), and that position is unlikely to change. That said, I do believe we need a license that clearly has a &#34;strong copyleft&#34; effect on photographs and similar media, so that when they are used e.g. in newspaper articles, the surrounding articles would need to be copylefted, too. That is consistent with our licensing policy, but neither the GFDL nor CC-BY-SA have really developed clear and unambiguous language to this effect. Creative Commons is open to modifying CC-BY-SA to clarify that copyleft applies on images used in the context of other works (as opposed to only applying to modifications to the image itself). While not helping you with all use cases you&#39;re concerned about (it would still allow commercial use in ads, provided the ads are freely licensed), it should certainly limit use in ways which are consistent with our values. This is something we can continue to work on together. Beyond that, I&#39;d encourage the people concerned about commercial use to think about Wikipedia not as their primary publishing platform, but as a way to highlight and promote some of their work, while generating revenue elsewhere.--<a href="" title="User:Eloquence">Eloquence</a><a href="" title="User:Eloquence/CP">*</a> 01:56, 10 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<li>...[This] issue is a frequent proposal (especially on Commons and the listservs) and both the community and the WMF have been consistently opposed to the idea from the beginning. Yet it keeps getting proposed every few months and we have to go through the same arguments over and over again. The issue of non-commercial licenses is not simply &#34;a matter of degree&#34;, it would represent a fundamental change in the philosophy and values of both Wikipedia and the free culture movement (which Wikipedia has an integral relationship with).

<p>Please add new discussion/comments on the proposed introduction of NC content on Wikipedia below
</p>
<dl>
<dd>The goal here is to make the best free encyclopaedia possible. Policies should be chosen to reflect that, not philosophical viewpoints. A NC licence option would encourage artists to release their work, allow the use of many existing NC works, and potentially open other image archives for use in articles. In many cases it may also be possible to replace fair use works with higher quality NC licensed ones. <a href="" title="User:Noodle snacks">Noodle snacks</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Noodle snacks">talk</a>) 09:55, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>

<p>Here are my quick thoughts on the issue: This is a good idea as it will help Wikipedia in becoming a high quality encyclopedia and become more free (yes I know NC != free, but it is more free than fair use). However, we are also about free content so we should at least have some restrictions:</p>

<ul>
<li>Editors should not be allowed to upload self-made NC only content.</li>
<li>NC media should add significantly to articles.</li>
<li>Unused NC media should be deleted.</li>
<li>There must be no free equivalent. (However, I&#39;d like to see NC images replace fair use ones as it&#39;s easier on reusers)</li>
<li>No NC media on Commons.</li>
<li>NC media are not eligible for featured picture status.</li></ul>

<p>... but at the same time, we can relax on needing rationales and low resolution. <a href="" title="User:MER-C">MER-C</a> 12:55, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>It only makes it easier for non-commercial reusers. For commercial reusers, it may make it harder, as they&#39;d have to determine whether the use meets fair use for them. Currently our restrictive NFC policy pretty much ensures that if someone is reusing our content in a country with a fair use or similar law, that any fair use images we have would meet the law. &#60;font face=&#34;Broadway&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.</a><a href="" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man"><b><i>Z-</i></b><i>man</i></a>&#60;/font&#62; 17:13, 12 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

<p>Sigh. I have invested a considerable amount of money in my gear. I am uploading the maximum feasible resolution versions of my work, as opposed to the proponents of the NC license which upload only downsampled trial-versions. I have done so to support the free content cause of Wikimedia. So I feel I have the <i>moral right</i> to this rant! And I would frankly feel betrayed if a gang of people hijacked this community and turned it into something countering this cause. The <i>exploitation</i> argument alludes to primal instincts (<a href="" title="de:Futterneid">de:Futterneid</a>). The <i>making content available</i> argument is moot. If the content is so important for the illustration of articles then en already has fair use. It does not take bad faith assumptions to see what this really is about, the proponents spelled it out themselves numerous times: making profit from their pictures. Not that profit-making is bad per se. It actually is not, although Diliff want us to believe that it is in the case of the bad companies! But the free content cause is more important. If you do not agree with that then you are in the wrong place. Flickr welcomes your contributions. --<a href="" title="User:Dschwen">Dschwen</a> 14:44, 12 March 2009 (UTC)

<ul>
<li>Agreed. All this talk about how &#34;philosophical viewpoints&#34; are not important is rubbish. Wikipedia would not exist without those philosophical viewpoints. I have also invested considerable money in photographic equipment, and not for the purpose of making money, but for the purpose of sharing with the rest of the world (not just Wikipedia). This is why 100% of my photographic contributions are donated to the public domain. People who are worried about the &#34;commecial value&#34; of their photographs should post them to Flickr or sell them.

<li>But guys what&#39;s going to change if Wikipedia were to introduce NC? You&#39;ll continue uploading under GFDL at full res and that&#39;s great. But there&#39;ll also be a whole lot more new NC content uploaded. I don&#39;t see the issue - unless it&#39;s a case of &#34;look how much I&#39;ve sacrificed, why aren&#39;t you sacrificing the same?&#34; In which case I&#39;d suggest you are contributing for the wrong reasons. If you want to be so altruistic then fine. If I want to retain some of my image rights then why not? As long as it&#39;s building a better encyclopedia I can&#39;t see the problem. Expunging valuable contributions to Flickr is not helpful --<a href="" title="User:Fir0002">Fir0002</a> 07:39, 13 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>If you want to retain and exercise your proprietorial rights, then a project whose aim is to provide <i>content over which such proprietorial rights are not exercised by its creators</i> is not for you, because your aims differ from its.  This is a project to build a <i>free-content</i> encyclopaedia, as an alternative to proprietary content encyclopaedias.  It is not a project to build a proprietary content encyclopaedia.

<li>If Wikipedia had to be finished on a certain date in the near future, and non-commercial images were the <i>only</i> way to create a complete encyclopedia, then maybe we would be open to them. But for now, there just seems little reason to start including them. Is there a non-commercial image that is mandatory for an article that can not be taken again in a similar fashion by someone who is willing to license it freely?

<ul>
<li>Given that major organizations like the LA Times and Al Jazeera have adopted CC-NC, I&#39;d rather use their content under CC-NC (at full resolution and without the ambiguity and hassle of per-page rationales) than use fair use for such things.  As I suggested at the prior thread, I&#39;d like to see the limited adoption of CC-NC as an option to replace fair use.  <a href="" title="User:Dragons flight">Dragons flight</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Dragons flight">talk</a>) 18:22, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I admit I don&#39;t know all that much about the licences or an anything, but just to echo above, it seems to be that &#34;more free&#34; is better -- that is to say, since we DO allow non-free stuff, why can&#39;t we also allow the median solution? Or to put it a different way, if there&#39;s only a choice between something non-free and something non-commercial, how could anything think the former is better? <a href="" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Melodia">talk</a>) 19:13, 12 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You are making a false distinction.  &#34;Non-free&#34; is, simply put, a limitation of the users&#39;s freedoms to copy, use, modify, create derived works from, and so forth.  Preventing the user from using a work in certain contexts, that the author has chosen to be &#34;unacceptable&#34; for whatever reason, is <i>exactly that sort of limitation of freedom</i>.  It&#39;s that simple.  Read <a class="externallink" href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#non-freeSoftware" rel="nofollow" title="http://gnu.org/philosophy/categories.html#non-freeSoftware">this</a> and <a class="externallink" href="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">this</a>.&#60;p&#62;What we set out to do, in these Foundation projects, is to provide an alternative to <i>proprietary content</i>, be that proprietary encylopaedias, proprietary dictionaries, proprietary textbooks, proprietary newspapers, or other things.  Saying &#34;I, the author, do not allow you to use my content in contexts X, Y, and Z.&#34; is exercising <i>exactly</i> the sort of <i>proprietary control</i> that we aimed, and still aim, to be the free alternative to.&#60;p&#62;So the answer is that we don&#39;t actually want <i>any of it</i>, because it isn&#39;t what we are aiming to achieve.  Non-free content is only allowed under limited, and exceptional, circumstances.  It is not the norm, nor is it our aim for it to <i>be</i> the norm.  <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 21:24, 13 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>I don&#39;t think that uploading the highest possible resolution vs uploading downsampled automatically gives you the moral high ground. This isn&#39;t a holier than thou issue. We all have a fondness for Wikipedia and want it to be a success. It is just that some of us differ about how to judge this success and the policies that should be applied to make it a success. And I think you are <b>clearly assuming bad faith</b> by continuing to assert that the primary motivation is for us to personally profit from a NC license. I have stated (as have Muhammed and Fir) numerous times that this is simply not the case. Can I ask you, Dschwen, why you think it is such a great idea that companies unrelated to Wikipedia/Wikimedia be able to use free content specifically to make a profit for themselves? I&#39;ve always just had this idea that you should profit from producing something, whether it be physical, intellectual, etc, not just from taking something for free. <a href="" title="User:Diliff">Diliff</a>   &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User talk:Diliff">(Talk)</a>   <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Diliff">(Contribs)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 17:48, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>It&#39;s very strange that you claim that xe is assuming bad faith about your profit motivitation when only two sentences later you state it outright.  You wish to exercise proprietorial rights over your content, in particular a copyright, in order to deny everyone else apart from you the ability to profit from your creation.  Whilst that is one of the underlying motivations for the existence of copyright in the first place, it is the antithesis of <i>what we have set out to do here</i>.  Providing content that is <i>not</i> encumbered by such restrictions put in place by its proprietors, preventing free use for any purpose, is our aim, one that is essentially beyond debate and one that is explicitly part of the <a href="" title="foundation:Mission statement">Wikimedia Foundation&#39;s mission</a>.  This is a project created by and involving people who share that aim.  People who do not share that aim can set up their own projects to write proprietary encyclopaedias and so forth.  This is where we draw the line in what <i>we</i> are setting out to do.  <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 21:24, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>Quite so.  &#34;Copyleft&#34; deliberately uses copyright law to work against copyright.  From a certain point of view, CC-BY-SA is more &#34;free&#34; than CC-BY or even the public domain, because it is viral and creates more free content.  This, Diliff, is the motivation for allowing companies no restrictions on how they use material -- their reuse must <i>also</i> be under the same copyleft licence, and more copyleft content is created, which we can then use ourselves.  <a href="" title="User:Sam Korn">&#60;nowiki&#62;<a href="" title="Sam Korn">Sam Korn</a>&#60;/nowiki&#62;</a> &#60;sup&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Sam Korn">(smoddy)</a>&#60;/sup&#62; 23:27, 13 March 2009 (UTC)

<li>You are under a delusion if you think that companies are licensing derivatives under the same free license.

<li>One suspects there may be ways more friendly than &#34;under a delusion&#34; and &#34;ideological fairy land&#34; in which you could have phrased this comment...  Of course there will be uses of free images or text that do not result in more free images or text.  Perhaps that will even be the majority of cases.

<li>I noticed the same thing.  I&#39;m not an expert on the GFDL, but I see attribution and a link to the license, which looks like compliance.  Britannica&#39;s <a class="externallink" href="http://corporate.britannica.com/termsofuse.html" rel="nofollow" title="http://corporate.britannica.com/termsofuse.html">terms of use</a> also state, &#34;Britannica claims no compilation copyright in images or materials that are subject to the GNU Free Documentation License or similar licenses.&#34;  While it&#39;s certainly possible or likely there are infringing uses to be found, Fir0002&#39;s own example disproves his argument that companies will not comply with the license. <a href="" title="User:Fletcher">Fletcher</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Fletcher">talk</a>) 21:53, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The argument for licenses like GFDL and CC-BY-SA was that it would create new derivative content under the same license. Ie it would make Brittanica license the entire article under the GFDL/CC-BY-SA.

<li>Can you actually cite that argument?  I see what Sam claimed above, but you may be interpreting him too literally in that he means companies must release _your_ image and any derivatives thereof under copyleft, not release their whole product associated with your image under copyleft, although Sam can correct me if I&#39;m wrong.  I would assume Britannica does not think its article is a derivative of your image, which is supported by the interpretation <a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verbatim_copying#Making_verbatim_copies_of_images" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Verbatim_copying#Making_verbatim_copies_of_images">here</a>.

<li>Your logic is flawed. Just because I state my belief that I don&#39;t think companies should be profiting from of Wiki&#39;s images, it doesn&#39;t mean that my motivation is for <b>me to profit</b> from it. Why don&#39;t you actually read and understand what I&#39;ve said, instead of twisting it to make me look like I&#39;m still hiding my true intentions? Just today in fact, I received an email from a Korean businessman who contacted me to confirm whether he could sell my photos as posters to his clients(he gives the example of 5 metres by 2 metres). This is clearly <b>not</b> what most of us envisioned when we uploaded our images to Wikipedia, but as long as he puts a little attribution to me and a link to the CC-BY-SA license, he is free to do this by virtue of the licensing we have, and I just think it is morally wrong. Rather than do what someone in his position used to have to do in days gone by (purchase the photo or take the photo himself), now he can just take the work we&#39;ve created and profit from it. Just to clarify, I have no problem with people using my photos for educational purposes because I think information should be free, but I don&#39;t like the idea of someone else profiting from the <b>work</b> that people have done. Please do not confuse this with me wishing to profit from Wikipedia, because that is not it. I only think that if a photo can make you money, you shouldn&#39;t be able to take it from the author for free. You should give him a fair price for the work. That is my primary argument, and it applies to anyone, not just myself. It is an ideological standpoint about the ethics of the work we donate to Wikipedia, not a selfish personal one. <a href="" title="User:Diliff">Diliff</a>   &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User talk:Diliff">(Talk)</a>   <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Diliff">(Contribs)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 18:43, 14 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li>

<li>Since Wikipedia is <a href="" title="GFDL">GFDL</a> constrained, it cannot limit reuse to non-commercial use only.

<li>Then what of already non-free content? They have to decide their own rules on those.

<dd>If the USG did copyright official photographs then indeed we would have to apply the fair use criteria to the Trinity tests -- and no doubt the images would pass, as there is a good rationale for using them.  Thus I think your comparison is a bit exaggerated, because the first detonation of a nuclear bomb is a very significant event, whereas people get married and have children all the time; showing a picture of Hayden and Fonda together is not really needed.  I personally think your image should be allowed, however, but a strict reading of the rules might cause someone to have a different idea.  But the Trinity tests without a picture would be severely lacking.  <a href="" title="User:Fletcher">Fletcher</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Fletcher">talk</a>) 22:15, 16 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>

<li>It&#39;s true that avoiding NC images limits what images are available to some extent. The important thing is that Wikipedia is not <i>just</i> an attempt to create a high-quality encyclopedia, or even a high-quality free encyclopedia; it&#39;s an attempt to create an information source from which many novel applications can be derived. It&#39;s raw material. One look at <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia_in_academic_studies">Wikipedia:Wikipedia_in_academic_studies</a> shows the myriad novel uses to which our data has been applied, often in unexpected ways. Some of these novel transformations will originate in companies who will want to be compensated for those efforts, and I think the potential to engage in such a practice would only enrich society at large. <a href="" title="User:Dcoetzee">Dcoetzee</a> 13:02, 14 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>


<ul>
<li>By giving in, we weaken our mission: we&#39;re a free (as in speech) encyclopedia. It&#39;s not Encylopedia OR Free, it&#39;s Encyclopedia AND Free. Do the logic: if we let dilute our content, we lose the Free part of our mission. The world really could use a free encyclopedia. No one else is making such a large free encyclopedia (at least so successfully). </li></ul>

<dd>Other people can make non-free encyclopedias. We&#39;re making the free one. Because that&#39;s what we do.</dd>
<dd>And yes I understand that this means that we can&#39;t do certain things. And yes, it&#39;s too bad. But there&#39;s no point making yet another non-free encyclopedia. Those already exist.</dd></dl>

<dd>I think that there are really two arguments here: the rights of the photographers and the use of untapped archival and Flickr images. As for the photographers (I&#39;m not one), I understand that you put a lot of effort in to your work, but many people who contribute to text do so altruistically, too, and have their content usurped elsewhere. They don&#39;t even get attribution (it&#39;s a collaborative effort, and no one but editors look at page history); photographers do if they license under CC-BY. (Caveat: Writers don&#39;t need to buy and learn to use expensive equipment, other than a computer with an internet connection, or travel to remote parts of the world, or wait until an animal is posed just right, etc.) As for archival and Flickr images, I think everyone agrees that NC is preferable to fair use (although some oppose both). Such, it should be possible to upload NC images as fair use, with all associated restrictions, and replace &#34;real&#34; fair use images. The murky water is, how many of these restrictions can we lift? Can we tolerate higher resolutions, or lower standards for inclusion? We could create a new bureaucracy of templates for NC images, like FU but less stringent, or use the existing FU system (much simpler) without benefiting from lightened restrictions. But first, we need to decide the ideology of being &#34;the free encyclopedia&#34; or &#34;the encyclopedia that is mostly free&#34;. I think that a more impartial discussion will follow if we focus on archival images instead of the heated issue of photographic contributions by editors. Above all, I suggest that we reach a conclusion that is simple and clear.--<a href="" title="User:HereToHelp">HereToHelp</a> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:HereToHelp"><i>talk to me</i></a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 14:32, 15 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Oh, I see what you&#39;re getting at now, but that still wasn&#39;t what quite I meant. I was comparing the &#39;freedom&#39; of CC-BY-SA to a theoretical CC-SA license, which would still require re-use under the same license. I know CC does not offer it, but I see that as being more free. The fact that you need to attribute is still something that I see as limiting in terms of re-use, because not everyone finds it appropriate to attribute. I suppose you&#39;ll think that I&#39;m still using an overly liberal interpretation of &#39;free&#39; though, as the restriction of attribution is more of a practical one than a philosophical one, but I think my interpretation is still valid in the real world. :-) <a href="" title="User:Diliff">Diliff</a>   &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User talk:Diliff">(Talk)</a>   <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Diliff">(Contribs)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 09:42, 18 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl>
<p>(outdent)Even [[http://freedomdefined.org/Definition freedomdefined.org] seems to think that attribution is acceptable, as they license under it. My other broad point was that NC certainly isn&#39;t worse than FU, therefore, we should be able to treat them as such. But whether both, or niether, should be allowed will never be settled firmly. Fair use images already make parts of Wikipedia unfree; but NC images with relaxed restrictions would become much more prevalent.--<a href="" title="User:HereToHelp">HereToHelp</a> &#60;sup&#62;(<a href="" title="User talk:HereToHelp"><i>talk to me</i></a>)&#60;/sup&#62; 02:53, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>That&#39;s because the freedomdefined.org live in the real world with shades of greys and not absolutes, as I said. It clearly <b>is</b> a restriction to the textbook definition of freedom, but one that they choose to tolerate. Just because they tolerate that restriction and not another, it doesn&#39;t mean that we can&#39;t compromise on a definition of freedom that works best for Wikipedia. I mean, no country has absolute textbook-definition democracy either, but that doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re all considered undemocratic, and I don&#39;t see why we cannot strive for a free encyclopaedia while putting certain useful restrictions in place either. I just think we need to look at this issue in terms of how we can practically improve the quality of content on Wikipedia, instead of look at it in black and white ideological terms, but clearly ideology rules here. :-) <a href="" title="User:Diliff">Diliff</a>   &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User talk:Diliff">(Talk)</a>   <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Diliff">(Contribs)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 08:51, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Well, hmph, ok,  I&#39;ll grant that there is an ideological component: Our ideology is to provide the means to sidestep those problems. We do so by providing part of the solution: we&#39;re offering an <i>encyclopedia</i> that sidesteps those practical problems. Other people might create computer programs or pictures, or whatever, but we&#39;re doing the encyclopedia.</dd>
<dd>In this way, we&#39;re doing our small part in creating a better, more practical world ;-)</dd>
<dd>But if we create an encyclopedia, but then -oops- forget to do the sidestepping, we&#39;re just back at square one, and we&#39;ll have just wasted everybodies time.</dd>

<dd>But I&#39;ve had a really good think about it, and I cannot for the life of me think of any really good reasons why our content <b>needs</b> to be commercial. For the record, I have said that an alternative to the NC license is a commercial license where commercial use is restricted to Wikipedia (as a means for it to recoup costs associated with providing the encyclopaedia, if absolutely necessary) only. An encylclopaedia&#39;s purpose is to educate, not to provide the ability to profit from its content. So unfortunately, you might bore me, but I feel that you providing reasons for why NC licensing has practical problems for Wikipedia <i>in the real world</i> is quite necessary for the discussion. </dd>
<dd>I&#39;ll wait for your response, but my impression is that any negatives would be outweighed by the increase in content quality if professional sources were able to upload their images without fear of loss of income. <a href="" title="User:Diliff">Diliff</a>   &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User talk:Diliff">(Talk)</a>   <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Diliff">(Contribs)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 11:27, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>(e/c)It doesn&#39;t <i>need</i> to be commercial, it doesn&#39;t need to be free at all. I&#39;m sure someone could make a license that only allows it to be freely used and modified on Wikimedia sites but otherwise fully copyright protected. We&#39;ve simply chosen to make it free. We want to not only compile the knowledge, but allow and encourage it to be spread by anyone in any way. Restricting this ability to only non-profit and education organizations greatly reduces our ability to do this. Its not just about people making loads of money off the content. Imagine someone running a small ad-supported website, and they want to use some Wikipedia content for a few pages. If there&#39;s NC content, then we&#39;re basically telling them that they can&#39;t do that unless they want to forgo any possible profit. They aren&#39;t raking in big bucks off the ads, they may not even be fully covering their hosting costs. In any case, why does it matter if people can profit off Wikipedia content? That&#39;s the point of it being free; people are allowed to do whatever they want with it. If they want to include it in something that makes a profit for them, they&#39;re free to do that as long as they respect the license terms, which includes giving attribution to the authors. We make a product that we give away for free, why does it matter if other people use it to make money? We could be profiting off it, we just choose not to, why force that restriction onto everyone else? &#60;font face=&#34;Broadway&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.</a><a href="" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man"><b><i>Z-</i></b><i>man</i></a>&#60;/font&#62; 17:25, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>As I said, I believe it does matter if we give content away for free and it is used to make a profit. I think a large proportion of the contributors to Wikipedia, other than the die-hard free content supporters that make up the upper echelon of the Wiki bureaucracy, would seriously reconsider doing so if they found that their donations were being used to make a profit for others. Most people see Wikipedia as a non-profit encyclopaedia for <b>educational use</b>, not a &#39;product&#39; to be sold. Yes, under the current licensing arrangement, Wikipedia <b>could</b> make money from its content, but there would be a massive uproar about it because that is not what Wikipedia exists for. I really find it strange how difficult it is for you guys (free content supporters) to see why we (those who don&#39;t see the encyclopaedia benefiting from the lack of a NC license) have a problem with commercial utilization of the content. It disrespects the intentions of the contributors who have donated their work primarily because of its potential to educate, and it inhibits many talented photographers from contributing who would otherwise benefit the goals of the encyclopaedia.

<li><b>OMG</b> that took too long to read for very little gained. NC content is usually of a lower quality than free or commercial, because they are holding on to the higher-resolution for themselves. Regardless, not allowing NC forces those who want the recognition of having their content posted on Wikipedia to release it under a truly free license. If NC were allowed then everyone would post NC.

<li>We are caught up in a predicament and I see only two possible solutions. To make a proper decision, we need to understand what we are facing. Jimbo nobly said, <i>&#34;Imagine a world in which every single person on the planet is given free access to the sum of all human knowledge. That’s what we’re doing.&#34;</i> The important question then is, is wikipedia there to provide businesses the opportunities to profit or to provide free access to knowledge? As wikipedia currently stands with the licensing, it loses quite a lot of valuable and highly encyclopedic images as has been discussed above. Having a NC license will not violate Jimbo&#39;s plan of providing <b>access</b> to free knowledge. Now we can either continue with our stubborn stance refusing to acknowledge the possibilities of a NC license or we can adopt the license and continue the goal of wikipedia, to provide <i>free access to the sum of all human knowledge</i>. A NC does not in any way limit free access of knowledge. &#60;small&#62;FWIW, many have said that profit is not a bad word and that businesses should be allowed to make profit at others expense. Mhh... profit does seem quite bad when the photographers want to benefit for their hard work, eh?&#60;/small&#62; --<a href="" title="User:Muhammad Mahdi Karim"><b>Muhammad</b></a><a href="" title="User Talk:Muhammad Mahdi Karim">&#60;small&#62;(<i>talk</i>)&#60;/small&#62;</a> 19:01, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>NC does not in fact permit full free access. Even <a href="" title="Lawrence Lessig">Lawrence Lessig</a> admits that.  </li>
<li>Open content is free as in speech, not as in beer. The ability to make a profit while producing open content allows people to work on it professionally.</li>
<li>That and I don&#39;t think that NC does for photographers what they think it does. NC is mostly intended as a kind of &#34;training wheels&#34; for people who don&#39;t quite understand the open economy yet.</li>
<li>Photographers would be better off contracting with sponsors or companies and placing a copyright disclaimer (www.gnu.org has details) or CC-BY requirement in their contracts. I understand that photography works somewhat different from programming, but I don&#39;t think it is *so* different that the methods of deriving a profit from content creation would suddenly be all topsy turvy. As to how to market such a disclaimer or license... that&#39;s an interesting question. :-) </li>
<li>Don&#39;t try to make people pay for things that already exist. They won&#39;t. You already have an NC image on wikipedia? Then there&#39;s no real interest in paying you more money for the same work (and let&#39;s not get into whether it would be morally justified to do so). The trick is to get people to pay for things that <i>don&#39;t</i> exist (yet).  </li>
<li>That way, in the long run, wikipedia will actually get many more pictures than it would in the short term with just NC, <b>AND</b> the photos will be much higher quality, because one can afford to take the time <b>AND</b> some of our photographers could afford to do the work all day <b>AND</b> that means they&#39;d get better at it faster <b>SO</b> that leads to even more photos of even higher quality. This is called a virtuous cycle. </li>

<li><b>Oppose</b> Let me just add my two cents again, though I see that some of my comments have been summarized above. Not thinking of ways to deploy Wikipedia in beneficial, profitable ways shows a lack of imagination on the part of the proposers. Two main points: <b>1)</b> To name one example that is currently happening, look to PediaPress and the book feature. Thinking about this business shows some of the economics of free content. First, PediaPress can&#39;t charge a ton of money for its products. Right now it&#39;s probably charging a little more than the marginal cost of printing + the marginal cost of Wikipedia (0). Eventually, other PediaPresses will enter the market and compete, driving the price essentially down to the marginal cost. PediaPress certainly gets to make a profit while others catch up, but in this sense it is being rewarded for bringing a new way of using Wikipedia to the market. And to the extent that its pricing is at marginal cost later, it&#39;s not really profiting from using Wikipedia - it&#39;s just earning back whatever return is customary on custom printing. In essence, since businesses&#39; pricing is bounded by Wikipedia&#39;s freeness, no one is taking advantage of Wikipedia. It just makes new methods of distribution and creative reuses available essentially for the marginal cost of these things. When the people who proposed this say they don&#39;t object to reusers charging a nominal price for distribution of Wikipedia, it seems strange that they don&#39;t realize this is all reusers <i>can</i> charge. Check out prices for <a href="" title="Linux">Linux</a> lately? <b>2)</b> Free content is beneficial for businesses in the same way that it is beneficial for students and non-profits. The marginal cost of photos is zero. Businesses having to pay for photos is an inefficient <a href="" title="deadweight loss">deadweight loss</a>. Consumers will have to pay more for things incorporating nonfree photos, even though they can be copied for a price of $0. To the extent that the free content movement is about eliminating the deadweight social cost of IP (which in my mind it is), these arguments are equally strong for business applications. <b>Misc/conclusion</b> The point is, commercial is freer because it allows new uses and will virally increase the scope of the commons. The instant we start allowing non-commercial content with lesser restrictions than other non-free content, Wikipedia&#39;s leverage at getting commercial licenses decreases. This proposal is fundamentally at odds with the bedrock foundations of Wikipedia. <a href="" title="User:Calliopejen1">Calliopejen1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Calliopejen1">talk</a>) 21:31, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So basically you think that the issue of freedom is more important than the actual quality of content on Wikipedia? Which one creates a better encyclopaedia? <a href="" title="User:Diliff">Diliff</a>   &#60;small&#62;| <a href="" title="User talk:Diliff">(Talk)</a>   <a href="" title="Special:Contributions/Diliff">(Contribs)</a>&#60;/small&#62; 22:53, 16 March 2009 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Well, we&#39;d certainly have a <i>great</i> encyclopedia if we accepted loads of by-permission content. Clearly you&#39;re drawing the line somewhere too of valuing freedom over quality. The point is, Wikipedia is a <i>free</i> encyclopedia. Free culture is the foundation of this entire project. There are plenty of non-free encyclopedias, and this project is something completely different. Wikipedia is not on a deadline, and is in a unique position of being able to leverage its popularity to demand truly free licenses of authors and organizations. (Who would contribute <i>free</i> media if they knew they could saddle it with restrictions and it still would get into our articles?) Wikipedia&#39;s role is the creation of free knowledge. Accepting non-free knowledge undermines that mission. <a href="" title="User:Calliopejen1">Calliopejen1</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Calliopejen1">talk</a>) 00:15, 17 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>

<dd><b>Oppose</b>. It seems that this attempt to partly abandon one of Wikipedia&#39;s fundamental goals eight years after its inception has already failed, as it should. But I want to add one argument which I haven&#39;t seen mentioned while skimming the previous discussion:&#60;br/&#62; CC-NC licenses create significant legal uncertainties. They may prevent uses which would be allowed under a naive understanding of &#34;noncommercial&#34;. Determining the exact meaning of &#34;noncommercial&#34; as used in the CC licenses is a very hairy issue, a problem which Creative Commons itself implicitly acknowledged last fall by <a class="externallink" href="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/9554" rel="nofollow" title="http://creativecommons.org/press-releases/entry/9554">launching</a> a research study on this question.

<p>It seems clear that he&#39;s only stating that a NC license cannot itself provide a basis for use of any material on Wikipedia.  The fact that someone, somewhere, released material under a NC license is irrelevant to whether it could nevertheless be used according to our policies for nonfree materials (which legally rest upon, but are in practice more restrictive than, the fair use doctrine).  Just treat materials only released under NC licenses as nonfree, as if they were not released under any license.  <a href="" title="User:Postdlf">Postdlf</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Postdlf">talk</a>) 19:13, 20 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>I&#39;m not sure if this is a policy already, but it really ought to be. Most of the time, a series of warnings (up to four generally) are given to editor who vandalise Wikipedia. This is normally done as a way to &#34;AGF&#34; that these vandals are merely testing the wiki, and we give them plenty of chance to stop. However, if an IP or account vandalises a BLP in <i>any</i> way, they should be blocked on sight. I personally think the warning system is a waste of time, but realise it&#39;s quite entrenched and would be difficult to remove.

<dd>The blocking proposal is a good idea; I&#39;ve been doing something like this for attack-ish vandalism directed toward a living person.

<ul>
<li>It&#39;s not actually that rare.  The last case that I personally came across, where editors were almost to the point of blocking <i>a BLP complainaint with a legitimate complaint</i> for vandalism, rather than listening to the complaint, was <a href="#Sanaz_Shirazi" title="Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard/Archive60">the case of Sanaz Shirazi</a>, a mere fortnight ago. <a href="" title="User:Uncle G">Uncle G</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Uncle G">talk</a>) 12:37, 14 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>Having this as a blanket policy is not a good idea, there is a clear difference between adding &#39;sjngkrngkerngk&#39; to a BLP or adding &#39;.... is a paedophile&#39; to a BLP. For the second a straight block would almost always be appropriate but while the first is vandalism as the <a href="#Types_of_vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> policy says, it can be just a test edit &#34;can I really edit this page&#34; where a warning/greeting is the appropriate action. There are several types of vandalism on <a href="#Types_of_vandalism" title="Wikipedia:Vandalism">Wikipedia:Vandalism</a> where a straight block is not the best approach regardless of whether the page is a BLP or not. It should be the type of vandalism that guides the response, not just the page that the vandalism is made on. Adding &#39;asngakjenk&#39; or removing an AFD tag from a page should get a warning regardless of whether the page is a BLP or not, while adding &#39;.... is a paedophile&#39; to a BLP or to <a href="" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a> or <a href="" title="United States presidential election, 2008">United States presidential election, 2008</a> for example should be treated seriously regardless of wheter that page is a BLP or not. <a href="" title="User:Davewild">Davewild</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Davewild">talk</a>) 11:31, 14 March 2009 (UTC)</p>
<p><a href="" title="User:Davewild">Davewild</a> makes an excellent point, and it&#39;s one that I echo.  It&#39;s also one that was made in the previous discussion, which the proposers here don&#39;t appear to have appreciated.  We, as administrators, are not robots.  We aren&#39;t <i>supposed</i> to blindly and unthinkingly follow simplistic step-by-step procedures.  We aren&#39;t supposed to have a simpleminded &#34;Vandalize once, get first warning. Vandalize again, get second warning.  Vandlize thrice, &#38;hellip;&#34; approach, or indeed a simplistic &#34;Vandalize a BLP, get blocked without warning.&#34; approach.  We are supposed to <i>think about what we are doing</i>.  We were entrusted with the extra tools in the first place because the community saw that we thought about our use of our tools.  There&#39;s a whole world of difference between a test edit and a deliberate falsehood, and our response to each should be appropriate.  There&#39;s also a whole world of difference between a removal of falsehoods, even be it an inept one that technically violates our strictures against edit warring, and a removal of valid information.  If we think in terms of simplistic and blanket procedures, then we hand the malicious the ability to game us and we prevent the benificent (but inexperienced) from helping us (and from gaining experience).  As the maxim goes, our policies, guidelines, and procedures are not a suicide pact.  And we <i>already do</i> hand out blocks at short notice, for the protection of the project, against people whose deliberate aim is unequivocally to hoax and to libel.  We <i>already have</i> a low tolerance for these.  But <i>thinking about the possible intent of the edits</i>, and gauging our tolerance accordingly, is something that we are supposed to do.  It&#39;s a requirement that the BLP policy imposes upon us, in fact.

<p>I agree with the essential idea: when people are obviously not acting in good faith they shouldn&#39;t be accorded an assumption of such. While on the one hand we should <a href="" title="WP:AGF">assume good faith</a> (AGF) as long as it&#39;s possible (so being softer on test edits is probably a good idea), we need, as Davewild pointed out, a human response that can make the judgement that someone is trying to use Wikipedia as a platform to make an attack on someone rather than just adding &#34;I LOVE PIE&#34; to a random page. I support this proposal as long as people will apply some sense to it and <a href="" title="WP:IAR">ignore rules where beneficial</a>. I do not support a semi-protection component, however: it won&#39;t help at all unless the blocked user uses sockpuppets or meatpuppets, in which case the existing <a href="" title="WP:PPOL">protection policy</a> justifies protecting the page. There are also other <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Flagged protection and patrolled revisions">proposals</a> or <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Abuse filter">tools</a> that I endorse for protecting BLPs which might help, especially in conjunction with rules like this. &#60;nowiki&#62;{&#60;/nowiki&#62;{<a href="" title="User:Nihiltres">&#60;span style=&#34;color:#233D7A;&#34;&#62;Nihiltres&#60;/span&#62;</a>&#60;nowiki&#62;|&#60;/nowiki&#62;&#60;span class=&#34;plainlinks&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User talk:Nihiltres">talk</a>&#60;nowiki&#62;|&#60;/nowiki&#62;<a class="externallink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=Nihiltres" rel="nofollow" title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Log?user=Nihiltres">log</a>&#60;/span&#62;}&#60;nowiki&#62;}&#60;/nowiki&#62; 20:51, 14 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<li>Not a good idea.  Or rather, to be fair, it is a good idea expressed in poor policy.  We should have no tolerance for vandalism of BLPs.  But this is different from &#34;zero tolerance&#34; of IP editors and registered editors who vandalize BLPs.  &#34;Zero tolerance&#34; is a punishment and deterrence concept.  Blocks (especially vandalism blocks) aren&#39;t really meant to deter.  I don&#39;t think that we decide to block or set block lengths on the premise that prospective vandals will observe IP talk pages, note that we don&#39;t give warnings before blocking, and decide not to vandalize.  I don&#39;t think that rejecting this should be construed as rejecting the ability of any admin to block an account where it is apparent nothing good will come from it in the next few hours.  I don&#39;t normally move through the 5-part warning scheme when dealing with vandals.  In the case where the edits are obviously malicious I usually just give a 4im and block or just block.  I do the same thing for BLP vandalism.  To me that is different than &#34;zero tolerance&#34;.  Maybe I&#39;m splitting hairs. <a href="" title="User:Protonk">Protonk</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Protonk">talk</a>) 00:39, 15 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<p>There a couple resons to give vandals a few chances other than a desire for leniency. Many stop vandalizing after having been warned, so there is no need to block. Aside from creating extra work for admins, unnecessary blocks cause collateral damage in some cases. On the other hand, I rather frequently see vandalism that slips by the RC patrollers, often when there are several vandalistic edits in a row (sometimes with intervening good edits). <a href="" title="User:Wkdewey">Wkdewey</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Wkdewey">talk</a>) 16:34, 15 March 2009 (UTC)</p>

<p>An alternative to the block-on-sight proposal, it could be made standard procedure that editors who insert defamatory vandalism about living people are given a single warning before blocking.

<li>Patrolled revisions: a &#39;passive&#39; flag used to monitor articles, especially blps, for vandalism, blp violations, pov pushing, etc, that can be used for all articles, but has no effect on the version viewed by readers.</li></ul>
<p>The proposals are independent but supplement each other. They involve the creation of a &#39;reviewer&#39; usergroup. This implementation can support secondary trials. The main trial should run for two months, then a community discussion should decide the future of the implementation.</p>

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="A_new_kind_of_admin">A new kind of admin</span></h2>

<p>I have been patrolling through the RfA&#39;s as of late, and have noticed that some of the oppose or neutral &#34;votes&#34; have been for very trivial matters. The level of standard for becoming an admin seems to have risen to (sometimes) unrealistic levels. I would propose that anyone wanting to become an admin could have two options:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The traditional RfA route of telling everyone how calm and knowledgeable one is and smiling whilst everyone throws rocks at you, or;</li>
<li>Become an &#34;Assistant&#34; Admin of sorts. Get two current administrators to &#34;sponsor&#34; you. You receive the administrator tools and go on an admin probationary period and start doing adminy things. You are observed for 3 months (or 2 or 4 or 6 or whatever). Then, after the probationary period and if your two sponsor admins concur, you go to the community for approval to become a &#34;bonafide&#34; administrator. If, after the probationary period, the sponsors feel you need more time, they can extend it or return your account to original.</li></ol>
<p>This way we can get more admin actions out there to unclog the backlog of AfDs, New Page speedies, AIV, etc., etc. without having to go through madening bureacracy of an RfA. At the same time, the sponsors (and the community) can monitor what kind of &#34;full&#34; admin you would be.--<a href="" title="User:Sallicio"><b>It&#39;s me...Sallicio!</b></a><a href="" title="User talk:Sallicio">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;math&#62;\color{Red} \oplus&#60;/math&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 18:09, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I think we just need to make it easier to de-sysop. I think admins should have to get recommissioned every couple of years. I know several people that aren&#39;t admins that should be, and several people that are admins that shouldn&#39;t be. But getting demoted is seen as the <b>worst possible thing</b> around here which is silly. ▫ <b><a href="" title="User:JohnnyMrNinja">&#60;font color=&#34;#202040&#34;&#62;Johnny&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#204040&#34;&#62;Mr&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#206040&#34;&#62;Nin&#60;/font&#62;&#60;font color=&#34;#204040&#34;&#62;ja&#60;/font&#62;</a></b> 18:47, 16 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl>

I&#39;ve seen speedy delete nominees sit there for days before an admin was able to come through and properly dispose of the &#34;well-known&#34; band consisting of n/n Jr. High School students; or the guy that loves his brand-new girlfriend or hates his English teacher.--<a href="" title="User:Sallicio"><b>It&#39;s me...Sallicio!</b></a><a href="" title="User talk:Sallicio">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;math&#62;\color{Red} \oplus&#60;/math&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 18:56, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

<p>I&#39;m not sure on that. It could either be by consensus of the sponsoring admins, or perhaps a subsection in the Assistant Admin&#39;s talk page whereby any editor could comment on the Assistant&#39;s behavior (good or bad) and &#34;x&#34; amount of negative feedback might constitute extended probation and perhaps &#34;y&#34; amount of negative feedback might constitute desysoping. With that, the only ones that could desysop the Assistant would be the sponsoring admins or a bureaucrat (this would help keep an inexperienced editor from adding nonsensical complaints to the tally because he is upset that the assistant reverted his &#34;Coke-is-better-than-Pepsi&#34; additions to the <a href="" title="Coca-Cola">Coca-Cola</a> article.

<dd>That seems to place a lot of trust with the sponsoring admins. If (as seems likely) these admins are good friends of the probationer, and are unwilling to desysop them for any but the most extreme violation, then we end up with a new class of admins who are just as difficult to remove as admins are at present, but are much easier to create. <a href="" title="User talk:Algebraist">Algebraist</a> 19:22, 16 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>I thought of that, too. Then we could make it 2 admins and a &#39;Crat to allow the Assistant Admin. Or three admins and a &#39;Crat. No system will be flawless, but I think that we should apply <a href="" title="WP:AGF">WP:AGF</a> with our current admins&#39; judgment and that of the nominee.--<a href="" title="User:Sallicio"><b>It&#39;s me...Sallicio!</b></a><a href="" title="User talk:Sallicio">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;math&#62;\color{Red} \oplus&#60;/math&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 19:28, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>This sounds like more work than its worth. So we have a bunch of experienced admins spending several months babysitting a new admin, who&#39;s going to be scared shitless at the prospect of immediate desysopping for a mistake (the odds of ever passing RFA after that happens drop precipitously) that he won&#39;t even consider doing anything remotely controversial. &#60;font face=&#34;Broadway&#34;&#62;<a href="" title="User:Mr.Z-man">Mr.</a><a href="" title="User talk:Mr.Z-man"><b><i>Z-</i></b><i>man</i></a>&#60;/font&#62; 22:40, 16 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>The sponsoring admins don&#39;t have to babysit, per se. They just need to be there if the prospect has questions or needs help. It&#39;s no different than <a href="" title="WP:AAU">WP:AAU</a>.

<li>I don&#39;t really like the &#34;assistant&#34; idea, but I would support reconfirmation for admins after 3 years.  Many become inactive by then, so the workload need not be that heavy, and it might provoke some older inactive ones to do more.  For the first year, admins of 4+ years standing should be renominated on their anniversary, along with the 3 yr-olds - there won&#39;t be huge numbers of active ones.  Rather more flexibility should be given to the bureaucrats to allow for a few cases where admins have made themselves unpopular by valid actions in controversial areas. <a href="" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Johnbod">talk</a>) 17:34, 17 March 2009 (UTC)</li>
<li>I disagree specifically with the part of the proposal about the sponsors being able to extend the time, as it would be essentially equivalent to allowing admins to make their friends admins indefinitely, except possibly for something like a standard 3 months plus an optional extension of an additional 1 month, for example; there should be a definite limit. Otherwise I&#39;m neutral about the proposal. I tend to agree with Mr. Z-man&#39;s &#34;scared shitless&#34; comment, with the additional rock-and-a-hard-place aspect that one would also be afraid of being criticized for doing too few admin actions during the probationary period.&#60;br/&#62;I have an idea!  If we want to increase the number of admins, we can develop a standard few words and link to place at the top of every RfA, along the lines of &#34;here are the reasons we need more admins, therefore think twice before opposing someone for minor issues or one or two mistakes&#34;. The link could go to up-to-date information about current admin backlogs, as well as that Wikipedian staple, further discussion. &#60;span style=&#34;color:Purple; font-size:11pt;&#34;&#62;☺&#60;/span&#62;<a href="" title="User:Coppertwig">Coppertwig</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Coppertwig">talk</a>) 23:22, 17 March 2009 (UTC)</li></ul>

<dd>The part about extension would definitely have term limits. The way the idea ran was just off-the-cuff. I think that we could tailor the assistant admin thing to something that would suit &#60;s&#62;everyone&#60;/s&#62;, &#60;s&#62;mostly everyone&#60;/s&#62;, more than 50 percent of the community. &#34;Assistant Admin&#34; or no, something should give. The system seems a bit out of pace with the size and scope of the project. If nothing else, there <i>should</i> be some kind of re-qualification process. But I think that term-limit RfA&#39;s might clog up the initial RfA backlog.--<a href="" title="User:Sallicio"><b>It&#39;s me...Sallicio!</b></a><a href="" title="User talk:Sallicio">&#60;sup&#62;&#60;math&#62;\color{Red} \oplus&#60;/math&#62;&#60;/sup&#62;</a> 02:42, 18 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Wouldn&#39;t reconfirmations of current admins kind of be the opposite of this proposal?

<p>We could limit the admin renom to a confirmation once every two years with the consensus of five editors, five peers (other admins), and two crats. But then, who&#39;s going to keep track of what the admins&#39; promotional dates are? I guess there could be a bot that could do that.

<h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Fair_use_images">Fair use images</span></h2>

<p>I&#39;m tired of people removing <a href="" title="Wikipedia:Non-free content">fair use</a> images, saying that someday a free image could be obtained or that the image has been removed from the article. The reason it&#39;s &#34;fair use&#34; is because Wikimedia doesn&#39;t have a free picture. If a free one could be obtained, that is not the point. A free one has not been obtained. Also, removing the image from the article is not a fair reason to delete it, since those who removed it from the article are the same as those who consider &#34;could be obtained&#34; to be a reason for calling it not fair use. Again, &#34;could be obtained&#34; is not the same as &#34;obtained.&#34; True or not, I see no reason to care whether or not it &#34;could be obtained&#34; when in fact it has not been obtained. --<a href="" title="User:Chuck Marean">Chuck</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Chuck Marean">talk</a>) 23:10, 16 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>In short, the frustration caused by not having an image is a good motivator for people to go look for images.

<dd>The problem is that the &#39;could&#39; at times gets a bit ridiculous. Not an image, but a while back someone said that a PD piece of music wasn&#39;t allowed to have a non-free 30 second sample, because someone &#39;could&#39; go hire a string quartet to record it. No matter the cost and energy needed to actually do such an endeavor. And such things bring on a slippery slope. If you say a string quartet is possible (since it&#39;s a common ensemble), what about a bigger, less common one? Would even a full orchestra? So while I agree with the motivational issue (that if it&#39;s there, people won&#39;t know to look for it), I think a bit of common sense needs to be applied. <a href="" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Melodia">talk</a>) 00:22, 17 March 2009 (UTC)

<dd>It&#39;s about what can be legally defended. &#34;Fair use&#34; isn&#39;t a law, it&#39;s a defense. Technically, all of fair use is blatant copyright violation.

<dd>It&#39;s not a /violation/ if it&#39;s legal, and if it&#39;s illegal it&#39;s not allowed on WP. The whole point of fair use law is that it IS allowed to be used in certain ways. A 30 second sample of a piece of music is perfectly legal in a demonstrative/educational setting such as Wikipedia. It&#39;s only that WP itself has more harsh rules than is legally allowed, which is why there&#39;s such a problem. As for using MIDI, well, that&#39;s not a particularly good solution, but it&#39;s true that it&#39;d be allowed without question under WP&#39;s rules. <a href="" title="User:Melodia">♫ Melodia Chaconne ♫</a> (<a href="" title="User talk:Melodia">talk</a>) 11:21, 17 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd></dl></dd>
<dd>Actually, the fact that a free image could be obtained is exactly the point.  Wikipedia is intended to be the <i>free</i> encyclopedia, and thus attempts to limit the amount of non-free media it uses.  This is why Wikipedia&#39;s policies are much stricter than that of U.S. fair use law.

<dd>I started a thread about this a while ago. The jist of the response I got is that files that are extremely costly to replace - like pictures of things that cannot be accessed or located, or things that would require millions of dollars to reproduce - are more likely to be permitted, per common sense. Just argue on a case by case basis. <a href="" title="User:Dcoetzee">Dcoetzee</a> 02:17, 19 March 2009 (UTC)</dd></dl>
<p>Actually Wikipedia&#39;s policy is intended to do more than protect merely Wikipedia or its contributors from legal action; the policy is also intended to build up a body of work that is as free as reasonably possible from licensing restrictions. There is a specific consensus in the case of living persons that we should not use &#34;fair use&#34; photos of them (not an iron clad rule as I understand it, but a strong guideline), because it&#39;s possible to track the person down and take a photo. As far as I&#39;m aware, that is the only area where fair use images are specifically strongly discouraged. In other areas, it&#39;s more of a judgment call as to how possible it is to come up with a free replacement image.</p>
